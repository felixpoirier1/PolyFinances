0,2011-04-27,"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon.  Welcome.  In my opening remarks, I’d like to briefly first review today’s policy decision.  I’ll then turn next to the Federal Open Market Committee’s quarterly economic projections also being released today, and I’ll place today’s policy decision in the context of the Committee’s projections and the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability.  I’ll then be glad to take your questions.  Throughout today’s briefing, my goal will be to reflect the consensus of the Committee, while taking note of the diversity of views as appropriate.  Of course, my remarks and interpretations are my own responsibility.   In its policy statement released earlier today, the Committee announced, first, that it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its security holdings, and, second, that it will complete its planned purchases of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the current quarter.  Of course, going forward, the Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings in light of incoming information and is prepared to adjust those holdings as needed to meet the Federal Reserve’s mandate.   extended period.   The Committee made no change today in the target range of the federal funds rate, which remains at 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an  1 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL In conjunction with today’s meeting, FOMC participants submitted projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2013 and over the longer run.  These projections are conditional on each participant’s individual assessment of the appropriate path of monetary policy needed to best promote the Committee’s objectives.  A table showing the projections has been distributed.  I’m going to focus today on the central tendency projections, which exclude the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.   I call your attention, first, to the Committee’s longer-run projections, which represent participants’ assessments of the rates to which economic growth, unemployment, and inflation will converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and assuming no further shocks to the economy.  As the table shows, the longer-run projections for output growth have a central tendency of 2.5 to 2.8 percent, the same as in the January survey.  The longer-run projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of 5.2 to 5.6 percent, somewhat narrower than in normal, or trend, rate of growth and its normal unemployment rate over the longer run, respectively.  The economy’s longer-term rate of growth and unemployment are determined largely by nonmonetary factors, such as the rate of growth of the labor force and the speed of technological change, and it should be noted that estimates of these rates are inherently uncertain and subject to revision over time.   The central tendency of the longer-run projection for inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent.  In contrast to economic growth and unemployment, the longer-run outlook for inflation is determined almost entirely by monetary policy; consequently, and given that these projections are based on the assumption that  2 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL monetary policy is appropriate, these longer-run projections can be interpreted as indicating the inflation rate that Committee participants judge to be most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices.  At 1.7 to 2.0 percent, the “mandate-consistent” rate of inflation is greater than zero for a number of reasons.  Perhaps most important, attempting to maintain inflation at zero would increase the risk of experiencing an extended bout of deflation, or falling wages and prices, which in turn could lead employment to fall below its maximum sustainable level for a protracted period.  Hence, a goal of literally zero inflation is not consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Indeed, most central banks around the world aim to set inflation above zero, usually at about 2 percent.   I turn now to the Committee’s economic outlook.  As indicated in today’s policy statement, the Committee sees the economic recovery as proceeding at a moderate pace.  Household spending and investment in equipment and software continue to expand, supporting the recovery, but nonresidential investment is still weak and the housing sector is depressed.  In the labor market, overall conditions continue to improve gradually.  For example, the unemployment rate moved down a bit further and payroll employment increased in March; new claims for unemployment insurance and indicators of hiring plans are also consistent with continued improvement.   Looking ahead, Committee participants expect a moderate recovery to continue through 2011, with some acceleration of growth projected for 2012 and 2013.  Specifically, as the table shows, participants’ projections for output growth have a central tendency of 3.1 to 3.3 percent for this year, but rise to 3.5 to 4.2 percent in 2012 and about the same in 2013.  These projections are a little below those made by the Committee in January; the markdown of growth in 2011 in particular reflects the somewhat slower-than-anticipated pace of growth in the first quarter.    3 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL The outlook for above-trend growth is associated with a projected reduction in the unemployment rate, which is seen as edging down to 8.4 to 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and then declining gradually to 6.8 to 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, still well above the central tendency of participants’ longer-run projections for unemployment of 5.2 to 5.6 percent.  The projected decline in the unemployment rate is relatively slow largely because economic growth is projected to be only modestly above the trend growth rate of the economy.   On the inflation front, commodity prices have risen significantly recently, reflecting geopolitical developments and robust global demand, among other factors.  Increases in commodity prices are in turn boosting overall consumer inflation.  However, measures of underlying inflation, though having increased modestly in recent months, remain subdued, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.  Consequently, the Committee expects the effects on inflation of higher commodity prices to be transitory; as the increases in commodity prices moderate, inflation should decline toward its underlying level.  Specifically, participants’ projections for inflation have a central tendency of 2.1 to 2.8 percent for this year, noticeably higher than in the January projections, before declining to 1.2 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and then running at 1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2013—both about the same as in January.   The Committee’s economic projections provide important context for understanding today’s policy action as well as the Committee’s general policy strategy.  Monetary policy affects output and inflation with a lag, so current policy actions must be taken with an eye to the likely future course of the economy.  Thus the Committee’s projections of the economy, not just current conditions alone, must guide its policy decisions.  The lags with which monetary policy affects the economy also imply that the Committee must focus on meeting its mandated objectives over the medium term, which can be as short as a year or two but may be longer,  4 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL depending on how far the economy is initially from conditions of maximum employment and price stability.   To foster maximum employment, the Committee sets policy to try to achieve sufficient economic growth to return the unemployment rate over time to its long-term normal level.  At 8.8 percent, the current unemployment rate is elevated relative to that level, and progress toward more normal levels of unemployment seems likely to be slow.  The substantial ongoing slack in the labor market and the relatively slow pace of improvement remain important reasons that the Committee continues to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy.   In the medium term, the Committee also seeks to achieve a mandate-consistent inflation rate, which participants’ longer-term projections for inflation suggest is 2 percent or a bit less.  Although the recent surge in commodity prices has led inflation to pick up somewhat in the near term, the Committee continues to project inflation to return to mandate-consistent levels in the medium term, as I have discussed.  Consequently, the short-term increase in inflation has not prompted the Committee to tighten policy at this juncture.  Importantly, however, the Committee’s outlook for inflation is predicated on longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable; if households and firms continue to expect inflation to return to a mandate-consistent level in the medium term, then increased commodity prices are unlikely to induce significant second-round effects, in which inflation takes hold in noncommodity prices and in nominal wages.  Thus, besides monitoring inflation itself, the Committee will pay close attention to inflation expectations and to possible indications of second-round effects.   In providing extraordinary monetary policy accommodation in the aftermath of the crisis, the Committee has not only reduced its target for the federal funds rate to a very low level, but has also expanded the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet substantially.  The Committee at this  5 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL meeting continued its ongoing discussion of the available tools for removing policy accommodation, at such time as that should become appropriate.  The Committee remains confident that it has the tools that it needs to tighten monetary policy when it is determined that economic conditions warrant such a step.  And in choosing the time to begin policy normalization as well as the pace of that normalization, we will carefully consider both parts of our dual mandate.   Thank you again, and I’d be glad to take your questions.   

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, tomorrow we’re going to get a pretty weak first-quarter GDP number.  Your own projections for the year have been downgraded in this meeting.  How—first of all, what do you see as the causes of the weak growth to start the year, even with monetary easing, even with payroll tax cuts?  And what’s behind this weaker forecast for 2011 GDP?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You’re correct.  We haven’t seen the GDP number yet.  But we, like most private-sector forecasters, are expecting a relatively weak number for the first quarter, maybe something a little under 2 percent.  Most of the factors that account for the slower growth in the first quarter appear to us to be transitory.  They include things like, for example, lower defense spending than was anticipated, which will presumably be made up in a later quarter; weaker exports—and given the growth in the global economy, we expect to see that pick up again; and other factors like weather and so on.  Now, there are some factors there that may have a longer-term implication.  For example, construction, both residential and nonresidential, was very weak in the first quarter, and that may have some implications going forward.  So I would say that, roughly, that most of the slowdown in the first quarter is viewed by the Committee as being transitory.  That being said, we’ve taken our forecast down just a bit, taking  6 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL into account factors like—like weaker construction and possibly just a bit less momentum in the economy.   

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, given what you know about the pace of the economy now, what is your best guess for how soon the Fed needs to begin to withdraw its extraordinary stimulus for the economy?  And could you also say what is your working definition of what “extended period” means from the purposes of the Fed statement?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, currently as the statement suggests, we are in a moderate recovery.  We’ll be looking very carefully, first, to see if that recovery is, indeed, sustainable, as we believe it is.  And we’ll also be looking very closely at the labor market.  We’ve seen improvement in the labor market in the first quarter relative to the latter part of last year, but we’d like to see continued improvement—more job creation going forward.  At the same time, we’re also looking very carefully at inflation, the other part of our mandate.  As I’ve noted, inflation—headline inflation—is at least temporarily higher, being driven by gasoline prices and some other commodity prices.  Our expectation is that—that inflation will come down towards a more normal level.  But we’ll be watching that carefully and also watching inflation expectations, which—you know, which are important that they remain well anchored if we’re going to see inflation remain under good control.  So to answer your question, I don’t know exactly how long it will be before a tightening process begins.  It’s going to depend obviously on the outlook and on those criteria which I suggested.  The “extended period” language is conditioned on exactly those same points:  “Extended period” is conditioned on resource slack, on subdued inflation, and on stable inflation expectations.  Once those conditions are violated, or are we moving away from those conditions, that will be the time that we need to begin to tighten.  “Extended period” suggests that there would be a couple of meetings probably before—before  7 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL action.  But, unfortunately, the reason we use this vaguer terminology is that we don’t know with certainty how quickly response will be required, and, therefore, we will do our best to communicate changes in our view as—but that will depend entirely on how the economy evolves.   

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, first, thanks for doing this.  This is a tremendous development.  There are critics who say that Fed policy has driven down the value of the dollar, and a lower value to the dollar reduces Americans’ standard of living.  How do you respond to the criticism that, essentially, Fed policy has reduced Americans’ standard of living?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thanks, Steve.  First, I should start by saying that the Secretary of the Treasury, of course, is the spokesperson for U.S. policy on the dollar and Secretary Geithner had some words yesterday.  Let me just add to what he said, first, by saying that the Federal Reserve believes that a strong and stable dollar is both in American interest and in the interest of the global economy.  There are many factors that cause the dollar to move up and down over short periods of time.  But over the medium term, where our policy is aimed, we’re doing two things.  First, we are trying to maintain low and stable inflation by our definition of price stability by maintaining the purchasing value of the dollar, keeping inflation low.  That’s obviously good for the dollar.  The second thing we’re trying to accomplish is to get a stronger recovery and to achieve maximum employment.  And, again, a strong economy, growing, with attracting foreign capital, is going to be good for the dollar.  So in our view, if we do what’s needed to pursue our dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment, that will also generate fundamentals that will help the dollar in the medium term.   

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  I’m sorry, Mr. Chairman, one can’t help but noticing that it’s been unsuccessful so far.  8 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the dollar—the dollar fluctuates.  One factor, for example, that has caused fluctuations that have been quite extreme during the crisis has been the safe-haven effect.  So, for example, during the height of the crisis in the fall of 2008, money flowed in to the Treasury market and drove up the value of the dollar quite substantially, reflecting the fact that U.S. capital markets are the deepest and most liquid in the world.  And a lot of what you’ve seen over the last couple of years is just the unwinding of that as the economy has strengthened and as uncertainty has—has been reduced.  But that’s indicative, I think, of the—of the high standing that the dollar still retains in the world.  Again, ultimately, the best thing we can do to create strong fundamentals for the dollar in the medium term is to, first, keep inflation low, which maintains the buying power of the dollar, and, second, to create a strong 

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  Chairman, Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Many Americans are upset that gasoline prices are rising so fast and that food prices are also going up.  Can you talk about whether there’s anything that the Fed can or should do about that?  And can you also comment or elaborate on the increase that we’ve seen in the inflation forecasts that the Fed put economy.   out today?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.  Thanks, Jon.  So, first of all, gasoline prices obviously have risen quite significantly.  And we, of course, are watching that carefully, that higher gas prices are absolutely creating a great deal of financial hardship for a lot of people.  And gas, of course, is a necessity.  People need to drive to get to work.  So it’s obviously a very bad development to see gas prices rise so much.  Higher gas prices, higher oil prices also make economic developments less favorable.  On the one hand, obviously, the higher gas prices add to inflation.  On the other hand, by draining purchasing power from households, higher gas prices  9 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL are also bad for the recovery.  They cause growth to decline as well.  So it’s a double whammy coming from higher gasoline prices.  Now, our—our interpretation of the increase in gas prices is the economist’s basic mantra of supply and demand.  On the one hand, we have a rapidly growing global economy.  Emerging market economies are growing very quickly, and their demand for commodities, including oil, is very, very strong.  Indeed, essentially all of the increase in the demand for oil in the last couple of years and the last decade has come from emerging market economies.  In the United States, our demand for oil—our imports have actually been going down over time.  So the demand is coming from a growing economy where we’ve seen about a 25 percent increase in emerging market output in the last—since before the crisis.  And on the supply side, as everybody knows who watches television, we’ve seen disruptions in the Middle East and North Africa, in Libya, and in other places that have constrained supply. That supply has not been made up, and that, in turn, has driven gas prices up quite significantly.  So, again, this is a very adverse development.  It accounts in the short run for the increase in our—pretty much almost all of the increase in our inflation forecast, at least in the very near term.  There’s not much the Federal Reserve can do about gas prices, per se, at least not without derailing growth entirely, which is certainly not the right way to go.  After all, the Fed can’t create more oil.  We don’t control the growth rates of emerging market economies.  What we can do is basically try to keep higher gas prices from passing into other prices and wages throughout the economy and creating a broader inflation, which would be much more difficult to extinguish.  Again, our view is that, most likely—of course, we don’t know for sure, but we’ll be watching carefully—our view is that gas prices will not continue to rise at the recent pace, and as they stabilize or even come down if the situation stabilizes in the Middle East, that that will provide some relief on the inflation front.  But we’ll have to watch it very carefully.    10 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  Thank you.  Scott Lanman from Bloomberg News.  Mr. Chairman, you’ve stated several times this year that the recovery won’t be fully established until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation.  First, has it become truly established yet?  And, if not, what’s your definition of a sustained period, and what’s your definition of stronger job creation?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as I mentioned, we’ve made a lot of progress.  Last moderate.  And we were actually quite concerned that growth was not sufficient to continue to bring the unemployment rate down.  Since then, we have seen a reasonable amount of payroll creation, job creation.  And that picked up in the most recent few months, together with the percent.  So the labor market is improving gradually, as we say in our statement.  And we’d just like to make sure that that is sustainable, and the longer it goes on, the more confident we are.  And, again, it is encouraging to see the improvement that we’ve seen in recent months.  That being said, the pace of improvement is still quite slow, and we are digging ourselves out of a very, very deep hole.  We are still something like 7 million-plus jobs below where we were before the crisis.  And so, clearly, the fact that we’re moving in the right direction, even though that’s encouraging, doesn’t mean that the labor market is in good shape.  Obviously, it’s not.  And we’re going to have to, you know, continue to watch and hope that we will get stronger and increasingly strong job creation going forward. 

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times.  Mr. Chairman, you say in your statement that longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, but a number of measures of inflation expectations have risen in recent months.  And it’s clear from your forecast that you expect headline inflation to run above core inflation for some period.  Is there anything that the  11 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL Federal Reserve can do to prevent the public from maybe incorrectly assuming that a period of higher inflation is on its way as a result?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, the inflation expectations that we are concerned about are medium-term inflation expectations.  So we’ve seen, for example, in the financial markets, in the indexed bond market, for example, or in surveys like the Michigan survey, we’ve seen near-term inflation expectations rise fairly significantly, which is reasonable given higher commodity prices, higher gas prices.  But for the most part, although there’s been some movement here and there, for the most part, I think it’s fair to say that medium-term inflation expectations have not really moved very much, and they still indicate confidence that the Fed will ensure that inflation in the medium term will be close to what I’ve called the mandate-consistent level.  What can we do?  In the short run, we can communicate and try to make sure the public understands what our policy is attempting to do, to be clear what our objectives are and what steps we’re willing to take to meet those objectives.  Ultimately, if—if inflation persists or if inflation expectations begin to move, then there’s no substitute for action.  We would have—we would have to respond.  I think—while it is very, very important for us to try to help the economy create jobs and to support the recovery, I think every central banker understands that keeping inflation low and stable is absolutely essential to a successful economy.  And we will do what’s necessary to ensure that that happens.   

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, what will be the impact on the economic recovery, job creation, and rates on mortgages and other loans when the Fed ends its $600 billion bond-buying program?  And a quick follow-up is, Will the Fed continue—how long with the Fed continue to allow for reinvestments?   12 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  As I—as I’ve noted and as you’re all aware, we are—we are going to complete the program at the end of the second quarter, $600 billion.  We are going to do that pretty much without tapering.  We’re just going to let the purchases end.  Our view is that—based on past experience and based on our analysis—is that the end of the program is unlikely to have significant effects on financial markets or on the economy, the reason being that, first—just a simple point that we hoped we have telegraphed today—we hope we have communicated what we’re planning to do.  And the markets have well anticipated this step.  And you would expect that policy steps which are well anticipated by the market would have relatively small effects because whatever effects you’re going to have would have already been capitalized in the financial markets.  Secondly, we subscribe generally to what we call here the stock view of the effects of securities purchases, which—by which I mean that what matters primarily for interest rates, stock prices, and so on is not the pace of ongoing purchase, but rather the size of the portfolio that the Federal Reserve holds.  And so, when we complete the program, as you noted, we are going to continue to reinvest maturing securities, both Treasuries and MBS, and so the amount of securities that we hold will remain approximately constant.  Therefore, we shouldn’t expect any major effect of that.  Put another way, the amount of ease, monetary policy easing, should essentially remain constant going forward from—from June.  At some point, presumably early in our exit process, we will, I suspect, based on conversations we’ve been having around the FOMC table, it’s very likely that an early step would be to stop reinvesting all or part of the securities which are coming—which are maturing.  But take note that that step, although a relatively modest step, does constitute a policy tightening because it would be lowering the size of our balance sheet and, therefore, would be expected to essentially tighten financial conditions.  That being said, we therefore have to make that decision based on the  13 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL outlook, based on our view of how sustainable the recovery is and what the condition—the situation is respect to inflation.  So we will base that decision on the evolving outlook. 

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  Do you think it will be several months away?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It depends on the outlook.  The Committee will have to make a judgment.   

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  Is it in the Fed’s power to reduce the rate of unemployment more quickly?  How would you do that, and why are you not doing it?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I should say, first of all, that, in terms of trying to help this economy stabilize and then recover, the Federal Reserve has undertaken extraordinary measures.  Those include, obviously, all the steps we took to stabilize the financial system during the crisis—again, many of which were extraordinary measures taken under extreme circumstances.  Even beyond the steps we took to stabilize the system, we have created new ways to ease monetary policy.  We’ve brought the federal funds rate target close to zero.  We have used forward guidance in our language to affect expectations of policy changes.  And, of course, as everyone knows, we have now been through two rounds of purchases of longer-term securities, which have seemed to have been effective in easing financial conditions and, therefore, providing support for recovery and for employment.  Going forward, we’ll have to continue to make judgments about whether additional steps are warranted.  But as we do so, we have to keep in mind that we do have a dual mandate, that we do have to worry about both the rate of growth but also the inflation rate.  And as I was indicating earlier, I think that—even purely from an employment perspective—that if inflation were to become unmoored, inflation expectations were to rise significantly, that the cost of that in terms of employment loss in the future, as we had to respond to that, would be quite significant.  And so we do have to make sure  14 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL that we are paying adequate attention to both sides of our mandate.  But clearly it is the case that we have done extraordinary things in order to try to help this economy recover. 

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  John Ydstie with NPR News.  Mr. Chairman, it’s the view of a lot of economists that the second round of quantitative easing hasn’t done much to help the economy.  What positive effects can you point to directly?  And if there are positive effects, can you really afford to end the program in June, with the unemployment rate still around 9 percent?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Well, first, I do believe that the second round of securities purchases was effective.  We saw that first in the financial markets.  The way monetary policy always works is by easing financial conditions.  And we saw increases in stock prices.  We saw reduced spreads in credit markets.  We saw reduced volatility.  We saw all the changes in financial markets and quite significant changes that one would expect if one was doing an ordinary easing of policy via a reduced federal funds rate.  And, indeed, we saw the same types of financial market responses in the first round, which began in March of 2009.  So we were able to get the financial easing that we were trying to get.  We did get very significant easing from this program.  You would expect, based on decades of experience, that easing financial conditions would lead to better economic conditions, and I think the evidence is consistent with that as well.  As I discussed in more detail in my Humphrey–Hawkins testimony in the beginning of March, between late August when I first indicated that the Federal Reserve was seriously considering this additional step and early this year, not only the Federal Reserve but many outside forecasters upgraded their forecasts.  And we saw—we saw strengthening labor that the second round of securities purchases was ineffective could only be validated if one thought that this—this step was a panacea, that it was going to solve all the problems and return  15 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL us to full employment overnight.  We were very clear from the beginning that, while we thought this was an important step and that it was at an important time when we were all worried about a double dip and we were worried about deflation, we were very clear that this was not going to be a panacea, that it was only going to turn the economy in the right direction.  And, indeed, we published some analytics which gave job creation numbers which were significant but not—certainly not enough to completely solve the enormous jobs problem that we have.  So, again, relative to what we expected, anticipated, I think the program was successful.  Why not do more?  Again, this was similar to the question I received earlier.  The tradeoffs are getting—are getting less attractive at this point.  Inflation has gotten higher.  Inflation expectations are a bit higher.  It’s not clear that we can get substantial improvements in payrolls without some additional inflation risk.  And, in my view, if we’re going to have success in creating a long-run sustainable recovery with lots of job growth, we’ve got to keep inflation under control.  So we’ve got to look at both of those—both parts of the mandate as we—as we choose policy.   

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  I’m Luca Di Leo from Dow Jones.  Mr. Chairman, what’s the right response if high oil prices persist?  On the one hand, they push inflation higher.  On the other, they can hurt the economy by hitting spending.  In the current environment, what’s the best strategy?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we’re going to continue to—to see what happens.  Our anticipation is that oil prices will stabilize or tend to come down.  If that happens or if at least oil prices don’t increase significantly further, then inflation will—will come down, and we’ll have—we’ll be close to our medium-term objectives.  So, as we look at oil prices, you know, as you point out, we have to look at both sides of the situation.  I do think that one of the key things that we’ll be looking at will be inflation expectations because, if medium-term  16 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL inflation expectations remain well anchored and stable so that firms are not passing on—at least on an ongoing, sustained basis—these higher costs into broader prices, into creating a broader inflation in the economy, as long as inflation expectations are well—are well stabilized, that won’t happen, then we’ll feel more comfortable just watching and waiting and seeing how things evolve.  Again, if we fear that inflation expectations look like they’re becoming less anchored, we would have to respond to that.   

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  Darren Gersh with Nightly Business Report.  You’ve talked a lot in the past about the problem of long-term unemployment.  Can the Fed effectively reduce long-term unemployment?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, first, you’re absolutely right.  Long-term unemployment in the current economy is—is the worst—really the worst it’s been in the postwar period.  Currently something like 45 percent of all the unemployed have been unemployed for six months or longer.  And we know the consequences of that can be very distressing because people who are out of work for a long time, their skills tend to atrophy—they lose contacts with the labor market, with other people working, the networks that they have built up.  And we saw in the European experience, for example, in the ’80s and ’90s, that a period of high unemployment with very long-term unemployment spells can actually lead unemployment to remain very high for a protracted period.  So it is a very significant concern.  And it’s one of the reasons that—that the Federal Reserve has been so aggressive.  By getting unemployment down, we hope to bring back to work some of the people who’ve been out of work as long as they have and, in that respect, try to avoid the longer-term consequences of people being out of work for months at a time.  So that’s part of the reason that we have been as aggressive as we have.  As the situation drags on and as the long-term unemployed lose skills and lose contact with the labor  17 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL of the scope of monetary policy.  At that point, job training, education, and other types of interventions would probably be more effective than monetary policy.

QUESTION.  Could I just follow up?  So a lot of the long-term unemployment that we’re seeing now, do you think that’s out of the scope of what the Fed can do?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, indirectly, of course, if—to the extent that we can help the economy recover and help job creation proceed, then some of the people who get jobs will be those who’ve been out of work for a long time.  That being said, we don’t have any tools for targeting long-term unemployment specifically.  We just—can just try to make the labor

QUESTION.  Peter Barnes, of Fox Business Network, Mr. Chairman.  Last week, Standard & Poor’s put the United States’ debt on a negative watch for the very first time ever.  What is your reaction to that?  And are you concerned, are you worried that the United States is going to lose its triple-A credit rating?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, in one sense, S&P’s action didn’t really tell us anything because everybody who reads the newspaper knows that the United States has a very serious long-term fiscal problem.  That being said, I’m hopeful that this event will provide at least one more incentive for Congress and the Administration to—to address this problem.  I think it’s the most important economic problem, at least in the longer term, that the United States faces.  We currently have a fiscal deficit which is simply not sustainable over the longer term.  And if it’s not the addressed, it will have significant consequences for financial stability, for economic growth, and for our standard of living.  It is encouraging that we are seeing efforts on both sides of the aisle to think about this issue from a long-run perspective.  It’s not a problem  18 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL that can be solved by making changes only for the next six months.  It’s really a long-run issue.  We’re still a long way from a solution, obviously.  But it is, I think, of the highest importance that our political leaders address this very difficult problem as quickly and as effectively as they can.  And to the extent that the S&P action goads a response, I think that’s—that’s constructive.   

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, John Berry.  In the past, there have been times when fiscal policy has tightened, and the Federal Reserve has chosen to ease its policy in response partly to that, given whatever the circumstances in the economy were at the time.  Congress appears intent at this point in cutting spending significantly; it might restrain the economy as it appears to be doing in Britain where they’re following a similar path.  Is there anything the Fed can do or should do if, indeed, there are large budget cuts sometime in the next 18 months?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, first let me say that, addressing the fiscal deficit, particularly the long-run unsustainable deficit, is a top priority.  And nothing I would want to say would be—should be construed as saying that I think it’s anything other than a top priority.  It’s very, very important that our leaders address this—address this issue.  I would also say that the cuts that have been made so far don’t seem to us to have very significant consequences for short-term economic activity.  Now, my preference in terms of addressing the—the long-term deficit is to take a long-term perspective.  It’s a long-term problem.  If Congress and the Administration are able to make credible commitments to cutting programs or in any way changing the fiscal profile going forward over a long period of time, that is the most constructive way to address what is, in fact, a long-run problem.  If the changes are focused entirely on the short run, then they might have some consequences for growth.  And in that case, the Federal Reserve, which is, as always, going to try to set monetary policy to meet our mandate, would take those into  19 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL account appropriately.  But so far, I’ve not seen any fiscal changes that have really changed our near-term outlook. 

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m Toshi Ogata with the Asahi Shimbun, Japanese newspaper.  I’d like to ask about uncertainties in the global economy or downside risks.  In minutes from the March meeting, you—the Committee noted that the development in Japan increased uncertainties.  So what’s the latest assessment on those risks or uncertainties such as tragedy in Japan or crisis in Europe and uprising in the Middle East?  And what would be the impact of those on the U.S. economy and the world economy?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, one of the things that our projections include—you know, we’re only producing the forecast today—with our minutes in three weeks, we’ll include the full detailed projections as we normally do.  One of the things that we include is the views of the participants on the amount of uncertainty there is in the forecast going forward.  And I think I can say, without too much fear of giving away the secret, that FOMC participants do see quite a bit of uncertainty in the world going forward, and a lot of that uncertainty is coming from global factors.  I’ve already talked about Middle Eastern–North Africa developments which have affected oil prices, conditions in emerging markets which have affected commodity prices and other things.  The European situation continues, and we’re watching that very carefully.  Now, obviously, you asked about Japan.  Let me first say, you know, that I’ve had a lot of contact with my Japanese counterparts, central bank Governor Shirakawa and other people in the Japanese government.  We collaborated with them on the foreign exchange intervention, as you know.  And we are very admiring of the courage of the Japanese people in responding to these situations and of—the central bank of Japan has done, I think, a good job in providing liquidity and helping to stabilize financial markets in what are very, very significant disturbances to the economy.  The  20 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL implications for Japan have been discussed at some length, and I think Governor Shirakawa recently talked about them.  In the near term, there will probably be a decline in Japanese output, reflecting the destruction, reflecting electricity problems, et cetera.  We believe that will be relatively temporary and that the economy will start to come back.  But, of course, this is a major blow, and it will take a lot of effort on the part of the Japanese people to restore the economy and to recover from the damage that was done by the—by the tragedy.  For the United States, we are looking at this very carefully.  Thus far, the main impact of the Japanese situation on the U.S. economy has been through supply chains.  We’ve noted some automobile companies, for example, that have had difficulty getting certain components which are manufactured mostly or entirely in Japan.  And that has led a number of companies to announce that they would restrain production for a time.  So there may be some moderate effect on—on the U.S. economy.  But we expect it to be moderate and to be temporary.  Again, the most important issue here is—is the recovery of Japan, and our good wishes go out to the Japanese people and their efforts to overcome the adversity that they’re facing.   

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, you have often stressed, as indeed you did again today, the importance of keeping inflation expectations low and stable to keep inflation itself under control.  But irrespective of inflationary expectations or psychology, isn’t it possible that the Fed’s policies could be providing the monetary tinder for inflation the longer they continue?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we—we view our monetary policies as being not that different from ordinary monetary policy.  I mean, it’s true that we’ve used some different tools.  But those tools are operating through financial conditions, and we have a lot of experience understanding how financial conditions—changes in interest rates, changes in stock prices, and so on—how they affect the economy, including both growth and inflation.  So we are monitoring  21 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL the state of the economy, watching the evolving outlook.  And our intention, as is always the case, is to tighten policy at the appropriate time to ensure that inflation remains well controlled, that we meet that part of our mandate, while doing the best we can to ensure also that we have a stable economy and a sustainable recovery in the labor market.  So the problem is the same one that central banks always face, which is choosing the appropriate path of tightening at the appropriate stage of the recovery.  It’s difficult to get it exactly right, but we have a lot of experience in terms of what are the considerations and the economics that underlie those the recovery to continue and allow the economy to return to a more normal configuration, at the same time keeping inflation low and stable.   

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  Hughes Honore, Agence France-Presse.  Many of the commercial partners of the United States are very concerned about the evolution of your foreign exchange rate.  If in one hypothetical case the dollar would sink to a terrible level which would harm very much the U.S. economy and the prospect for the global economy because it affects the confidence of so many people, would you consider changing your monetary policy in accordance to that threat?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as I said earlier, we do believe that a strong and stable dollar is in the interest of the United States and is in the interest of the global economy.  Our view is that the best thing we can do for the dollar is, first, to keep the purchasing power of the dollar strong by keeping inflation low and by creating a stronger economy through—through policies which support the recovery and, therefore, cause more capital inflows to the United States.  So those are the kinds of policies I think that in the medium term will create the conditions for an appropriate and healthy level of the dollar.  So I don’t think I really want to address a hypothetical which I really don’t anticipate, because I think that the policies that we are  22 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL undertaking, notwithstanding short-term fluctuations, will lead to a strong and stable dollar in the medium term.   facing Congress.  

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, Anthony Mason, CBS.  This is that rare news conference that actually makes news before it happens.  Can you talk a little bit about your decision to take this historic step of holding a news conference after a Fed meeting—why you chose to do it; what anxieties you may have had about doing it; and how, say, facing the media compares to 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thanks, mom [laughing].  Well, the Federal Reserve has been looking for ways to increase its transparency now for many years, and we’ve made a lot of progress.  It used to be that the mystique of central banking was all about not letting anybody know what you were doing.  As recently as 1994, the Federal Reserve didn’t even tell the public when it changed the target for the federal funds rate.  Since then, we have taken a number of steps.  A statement, which includes a vote.  We have—we produce very detailed minutes which are released only three weeks after the meeting, which is essentially a production lag.  We now provide quarterly projections, including long-run objectives as well as near-term outlook.  We have substantial means of communicating through speeches, testimony, and the like.  And so we have become, I think, a very—a very transparent central bank.  That being said, we had a subcommittee headed by the Vice Chair of the Board, Janet Yellen, looking for yet additional steps to take to provide additional transparency and accountability.  And the press conference was—came right to the top, because this is an area, first of all, where global central bank practice includes now—many central banks do use press conferences, and we have some experience with them.  And, secondly, it does provide a chance for the Chairman, in this case, to provide some additional color and context for both—in this case both the meeting and the projections that are  23 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL being made by the Committee.  So we thought it was a natural next step.  We’re not done.  We’re continuing to look for additional things that we can do to be more transparent and more accountable.  But we think this is the right way to go.  And I personally have always been a big believer in providing as much information as you can to help the public understand what you’re doing, to help the markets understand what you’re doing, and to be accountable to the public for what you’re doing.  Now, of course, the Fed didn’t do this for a long time.  And I think the counterargument has always been that, if there was a risk, that the Chairman speaking might create unnecessary volatility in financial markets or may not be necessary, given all the other sources of—of information that come out of the Federal Reserve.  It was our judgment, after thinking about this for some time, that at this point, the additional benefits from more information, more transparency, meeting the press directly, outweigh some of these—some of these risks.  And I think, over time, you know, we’ll experiment to try to make sure that this is as effective a venue as possible. 

[SECTION]

QUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart wrote a book looking at 800 years of financial history and discovered that, when you have a financial crisis, it takes a lot longer for the economy to recover.  Are people expecting too much from the Federal Reserve in terms of helping the economy recover?  And has that complicated your monetary policymaking?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, let me just say, first, that Ken Rogoff was a graduate school classmate of mine, so I’ve known him for a long time.  I’ve even played chess against him, which was a big mistake.  And I enjoyed that book very much.  I thought it was very informative.  And as you say, it makes a point that, as an historical matter, that recoveries following financial crises tend to be relatively slow.  Now, what the book didn’t really do, though, was given a full explanation of why that’s the case.  Certainly, part of it has to do with  24 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL the problems in credit markets, and my own research when I was in academia focused a great deal on the effects of problems in credit markets on recoveries.  Other aspects would include the effects of credit problems on areas like housing and so on.  And we’re seeing all that, of course, in our economy.  But that said, another possible explanation for the slow recovery from financial crises might be that policy responses were not adequate, that they—that the recapitalization of the banking system, the restoration of credit flows, and monetary and fiscal policies were not sufficient to get—to get as quick a recovery as might otherwise have been possible.  And so, you know, we haven’t allowed that historical fact to dissuade us from doing all we can to support a strong recovery.  That being said, it is a relatively slow recovery, and you can identify reasons for that.  Credit factors are one.  Another very important factor is that, you know, this was triggered by a bubble in the housing market, and the housing market remains very weak.  And under normal circumstances, construction, both residential and nonresidential, would be a big part of the recovery process.  And so there are a number of factors, and now we’re seeing high oil prices and other things.  There are a number of factors which are holding—which are holding the recovery back.  So there are good reasons for why the recovery is slower than we would like.  At the same time, it’s very hard to blame the American public for being impatient.  Conditions are far from where they—where we would like them to be.  The combination of high unemployment, high gas prices, and high foreclosure rates is a terrible combination.  A lot of people are having a very tough time.  So I can certainly understand why people are impatient.  And I guess the only thing I can say is that, while the recovery process looks likely to continue to be a relatively moderate one compared to the depth of the—of the recession, I do think that the pace will pick up over time.  And I am very confident that, in the long run, that the U.S. will return to being the most productive—one of the fastest growing and dynamic economies in the  25 of 26 April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL world.  And it hasn’t lost any of the basic characteristics that made it the preeminent economy in the world before the crisis, and I think we’ll return to that status as we recover.   Thank you very much, and thank you for coming.     26 of 26",Ben Bernanke,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
1,2011-06-22,"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon and welcome.   In my opening remarks today, I’ll briefly review today’s policy decision.  And I’ll place the decision in the context of our economic projections and our policy strategy.  I’ll then be glad to take your questions.  Throughout today’s briefing, my goal will be to reflect the consensus of the Committee while taking note of the diversity of views, as appropriate.  Of course, my remarks and interpretations are my own responsibility.   As indicated in the policy statement released earlier this afternoon, the Committee Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions—including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation in the medium run—are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.  The Committee’s planned purchases of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities will be completed by the end of this month, and the Committee will continue to reinvest principal payments from its securities holdings going forward.   In conjunction with today’s meeting, the FOMC participants submitted projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2013 and over the longer run.  These projections are conditional on each participant’s individual assessment of the appropriate path of monetary policy needed to best promote the Committee’s objectives.  I’ll focus on the information shown in the figures that have been distributed.  In each figure, the dark area denotes the central tendencies of our current projections, while the lighter shaded area denotes the full range of projections.  The longer-run projections, shown at the right  1 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL of each figure, represent participants’ assessments of the rate to which each variable will converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and assuming no further shocks to the economy.   The longer-run projections for output growth have a central tendency of 2.5 to 2.8 percent, and the longer-run projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of 5.2 to 5.6 percent—the same as in our April projections.  These projections may be interpreted as indicating participants’ current estimates of the economy’s normal or trend rate of growth and its normal unemployment rate over the longer run respectively.  It should be noted that these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to revision, because longer-run rates of economic growth and unemployment are determined largely by nonmonetary factors that may evolve over time and that often cannot be directly measured.   The central tendency of the longer-run projections for inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent.  Since the longer-run inflation outlook is determined almost entirely by monetary policy, these projections can be interpreted as indicating the inflation rate that each of the participants judge to be consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate of fostering maximum employment and stable prices.  In effect, the “mandate consistent” inflation rate is judged to be 2 percent or a bit less.   I now turn to the contours of the Committee’s economic outlook.  As indicated in today’s policy statement, the economic recovery appears to be proceeding at a moderate pace, though somewhat more slowly than the Committee had expected, and some recent labor market indicators have also been weaker than expected.  For example, the unemployment rate has risen by 0.3 percentage points since March, and new claims for unemployment insurance have moved somewhat higher.    2 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL The reduced pace of the recovery partly reflects factors that are likely to be temporary.  In particular, consumers’ purchasing power has been damped by higher food and energy prices; and the aftermath of the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan has been associated with disruptions in global supply chains, especially in the auto sector.  However, some moderation in gasoline prices is now in prospect, and the effects of the Japanese disaster on manufacturing output are likely to dissipate in coming months.   Consequently, as shown in the first figure, entitled “Change in Real GDP,” the Committee expects that the pace of economic recovery will pick up over coming quarters.  Specifically, participants’ projections for output growth have a central tendency of about 2.7 to 2.9 percent for this year and 3.3 to 3.7 percent for next year—growth rates faster than we have seen so far in 2011.  However, Committee participants have also generally responded to the recent slowing by marking down the growth projections for 2011 and 2012, which are nearly a  half percentage point lower than our April projections.  Looking further ahead, the central tendency of the growth projections for 2012—2013, sorry—is 3.5 to 4.2 percent, essentially the same as in the April projections.  As shown in the second figure, entitled “Unemployment Rate,” the unemployment rate is expected to resume its gradual decline towards levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with this dual mandate.  In particular, the unemployment rate is projected to edge down over coming months to 8.6 to 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and then decline gradually over the subsequent two years to a level of 7.0 to 7.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, still well above the central tendency of participants’ longer-run unemployment projections.  In short, we expect the unemployment rate to continue to decline, but the pace of progress remains frustratingly slow.    3 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL Inflation has moved up in recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods.  In addition, prices of motor vehicles have risen notably as a result of the recent supply chain disruptions.  However, as the effects of these factors dissipate, the Committee anticipates that inflation will subside in coming quarters to levels at or below its mandate-consistent rate, as shown in the figure entitled “PCE Inflation.”  Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ inflation projections is 2.3 to 2.5 percent for this year but declines to 1.5 to 2.0 percent in both 2012 and 2013—a trajectory that is broadly similar to that of our April projections.   The economic outlook provides important policy context.  In particular, the Committee’s policy strategy is intended to foster both aspects of our dual mandate—that is, promoting the economic recovery so that the unemployment rate returns over time to its longer-term normal level, and ensuring that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with our mandate.  At  9.1 percent, the current unemployment rate remains elevated, and progress towards more normal levels of unemployment is likely to be slow, as I noted.  Moreover, the inflation rate, which picked up in recent months, is expected to subside to levels at or below the rate of 2 percent, or a bit less, that most participants judge to be most consistent with the dual mandate.  The ongoing labor market slack and the subdued inflation outlook are key reasons for the Committee’s judgment that exceptionally low levels of the funds rate are likely to be warranted for an extended period.   Thank you.  I’d be glad to take your questions.  

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Mr. Chairman, the FOMC says that it will maintain short-term interest rates at an exceptionally low level for an  4 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL extended period.  Does that policy—or, does that guidance also apply for the Fed’s securities holdings?  In other words, will they be maintained at a very high level for an extended period?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We haven’t made any such commitment.  It’s true that when we begin to allow the portfolio to run off rather than reinvesting, that would be a first step in a process of exiting from our currently highly accommodative policies.  But we’ve not yet chosen to make any particular commitment about the time frame.  But we’ll be looking at the outlook and trying to assess when the appropriate time is to take that step. 

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  If I may follow up, why give guidance on—sorry.  If I may follow up, why give guidance on one policy tool but not give guidance on another policy tool when the Fed has talked about those two policy tools working together?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, that’s a good question.  It’s something we have on the table, something we’ve thought about.  But to this point, we haven’t taken that step.  

[SECTION]

GREG IP.  Mr. Chairman, the Committee lowered not just this year’s central tendency forecast but also 2012.  And yet, the statement of the Committee attributes most of the revision forecast to temporary factors.  So I was wondering if you could explain what seems to be persisting in terms of holding the recovery back.  I did see the statement says, “in part” to factors that are likely to be temporary.  Are there more permanent factors that are producing a worse outlook than three months ago?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as you—as you point out, what we say is that the temporary factors are “in part” the reason for the slowdown.  In other words, part of the slowdown is temporary, and part of it may be longer lasting.  We do believe that growth is going to pick up going into 2012 but at a somewhat slower pace from—than we had anticipated in  5 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL One way to think about it is that maybe some of the headwinds that have been concerning us, like, you know, weakness in the financial sector, problems in the housing sector, balance sheet and deleveraging issues—some of these headwinds may be stronger or more persistent than we thought.  And I think it’s an appropriate balance to attribute a slowdown partly to these identifiable temporary factors but to acknowledge a possibility that some of the slowdown is due to factors which are longer lived and which will be still operative by next year.  You note that, in 2013, we have growth at about the same rate that we anticipated in April.  

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, could you describe to what extent the situation in Greece and Europe was discussed at the meeting and what policy conclusions were reached?  And also could you tell us whether or not, in response to the recent slowdown, there was a discussion about further easing?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, with respect to Greece, that’s obviously very important.  That—it’s a very difficult situation.  We’ve been in close communication with our colleagues in Europe—obviously not part of the negotiations, but we’ve been kept well informed.  We had a G-7 call over the weekend, for example.  I think the Europeans appreciate the incredible importance of resolving the Greek situation.  If there were a failure to resolve that situation, it would pose threats to the European financial system, the global financial system, and to European political unity, I would conjecture as well.  So, yes, we did discuss it.  It’s one of several potential financial risks that we’re facing now.  But, again, we are mostly just following the—the situation closely and making sure that, as best we can, that our own institutions are well positioned relative to sovereign debt in the so-called peripheral countries.   With respect to additional asset purchases, we haven’t taken any action, obviously, today.  We’ll be reviewing the outlook going forward.  It will be a Committee decision.  I think the point  6 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL I would make, though, in terms of where we are today versus where we were, say, in August of last year when I began to talk about asset purchases, is that at that time, inflation was very low and falling.  Many objective indicators suggested that deflation was a nontrivial risk.  And I think that the securities purchases have been very successful in eliminating deflation risk.  I don’t think people appreciate necessarily that deflation can be a very pernicious situation where it could have very long-lasting effects on economic growth.   In addition, growth in payrolls has actually picked up.  In the four months before the Jackson Hole speech in August, there was about an 80,000 per month payroll increase.  So far in 2011, including the weak payroll report in May, the average is closer to 180,000.  So there has been improvement in the labor market, albeit not as strong as we would like.  As of last August, we were essentially missing significantly in both—on both sides of our mandate.  Inflation was too low and falling, and unemployment looked like it might be even beginning to rise again.  In that case, the case for monetary action was pretty clear in my mind.  I think we are in a different position today—certainly not where we’d like to be, but closer to the dual-mandate objectives than we were at that time.  So, again, the situation is different today than last August, but we’ll continue to monitor the economy and act as needed.  

[SECTION]

LUCA DILEO.  Luca DiLeo, Dow Jones.  Would budget cuts, which may begin at the end of this year, help or hinder the economy?  This goes back to the other question:  What’s fiscal policy like in the 2012 growth forecast?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The effect of fiscal cuts on the economy depends very much on the timing.  I’ve advocated that the negotiations about the budget focus on the longer term, say, 10 years, which is the budget window, or even longer if you’re taking into account entitlement reform, for example.  By taking a long-run perspective, we can help the economy by  7 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL reducing the risk that interest rates might rise suddenly.  We may help increase confidence in the part of households and businesses. And so I think it’s very desirable that we take strong action to lower our budget deficits over the longer term.   In doing that, I think it would be best not to—in light of the weakness of the recovery, it would be best not to have sudden and sharp fiscal consolidation in the very near term.  That doesn’t do so much for the long-run budget situation.  It just is a negative for growth.  So my answer is that it depends very much on the timing, and I hope that the congressional negotiators will take a longer-term view as they—as they discuss the issue.  

[SECTION]

DARREN GERSH.  Darren Gersh with Nightly Business Report on PBS.  If I could follow up on what he just said, there seems to be a growing view in the country that the deficit is the problem with jobs, and that immediate cuts in the deficit would grow the economy and immediately create jobs.  Many economists disagree with that.  Do you want to go a little further and maybe talk about that issue, and whether you agree with that view that seems to be taking root?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I don’t think that sharp, immediate cuts in the deficit would create more jobs.  I think in the very short run that we are seeing already a certain amount of fiscal drag coming from state and local governments, as well as from the withdrawal of previous federal stimulus.  So I think in the very short run that, you know, the fiscal tightening is—is, at best, neutral but probably somewhat negative for job creation. I think what people will understand, should understand, is that our budgetary problems are very long run in nature.  The projections made by the CBO, for example, talk about where our debt-to-GDP ratio will be in 2020, 2025, and so on.  That doesn’t mean we should wait to act.  The sooner we can act, the better.  But the most efficient and effective way to address our  8 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL fiscal problems—and, again, I think this is extremely important—is to take a longer-run perspective, not to focus the cuts heavily on the near term.  But by taking a long-run perspective and making a credible plan for reducing future deficits, we’ll lower interest rates, or at least prevent them from rising, and we will increase confidence.  And that could be very constructive.  But if it’s entirely focused on the near term, I don’t think that’s the optimal way to proceed.

NEIL IRWIN.  Mr. Chairman, Neil Irwin with the Washington Post.  Do you believe that the FOMC has the authority to set a, say, 2 percent inflation target on its own, unilaterally, or do you believe that it would need to go to Congress to get that target made more explicit?  If the former, are you considering doing it?  If the latter, are you considering going to Congress to ask them to do it?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, Neil, as you know, I’ve been a long-time proponent of an inflation target.  I think that it would help anchor inflation expectations; it would make it easier to reach our inflation objective.  At the same time, it’s not at all inconsistent with our employment objective because keeping inflation low and stable, keeping inflation expectations low and stable, actually gives the Fed more leeway to respond to short-term shocks to the economy.  So I think it’s something, you know, that is worth considering.   In terms of authorities, I would just say that there are multiple models around the world.  So, for example, in the European Central Bank, that bank has a mandate for price stability, period.  And they set their own definition of that using input from economists and others.  So I don’t think there’s a real barrier to setting a target.  However, it is very important that, first, that we communicate to the public what we’re doing.  Without sufficient explanation and background, many people might think that we were somehow abandoning our employment target.  So we need to make sure that that’s well understood both by the public and by Congress  9 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL that having a target would not mean that we were abandoning the other leg of the dual mandate.  Also, you asked about consulting with Congress.  I think under any circumstances, it would be important to take the pulse of Congress.  They—we might have the legal authority to do this, but I think we do need some buy-in from the Administration and Congress to take that step.  We are continuing to periodically discuss this issue.  It’s been part of our ongoing communications discussion, which included this press conference as one innovation, for example.  There’s nothing imminent.  But, again, we’ll continue to discuss this, and, as appropriate, we’ll be consulting about it.  

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.  What is your assessment of the impact on the United States economy if there is a default by one or more European nations?  What steps has the Fed taken to assess the consequences for American financial institutions?  And, in particular, have you examined the impact on derivatives holdings outside of the regulated financial system?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, to answer your second question first, we have been very assiduous in examining the exposures of financial institutions to the so-called peripheral countries.  The answer is that the banks that we regulate are not significantly exposed to—to those countries directly, at least.  They have significant exposures to European banks in the nonperipheral countries, and so indirectly, they have that exposure.  The—and that statement which I just made includes credit default swaps and so on.  The gross numbers that the BIS publishes do not fully account for a wide variety of hedges and other positions.  So we have asked the banks to essentially do stress tests and ask, looking at all their positions, all their hedges, What would the effect on their capital be if Greece defaulted?  And the answer is that the effects are very small.    10 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL It’s also the case that—well, we don’t oversee the money market mutual funds.  We have been keeping a close eye on that situation.  There again, the situation is similar in some sense, in that except—with very few exceptions, the money market mutual funds don’t have much direct exposure to the three peripheral countries which are currently dealing with debt problems.  They do have very substantial exposure to European banks in the so-called core countries:  Germany, France, et cetera.  So to the extent that there is indirect impact on—on the core European banks, that does pose some concern to money market mutual funds and is a reason why the Federal Reserve and other regulators are continuing to look at ways to strengthen money market mutual funds.   In terms of the impact of the problem in Greece on the United States, as I’ve indicated, the direct exposures are pretty small, and we’re doing all we can to monitor those exposures.  However, as we saw in a small situation, a small case last spring, a disorderly default in one of those countries would no doubt roil financial markets globally.  It would have a big impact on credit spreads, on stock prices, and so on.  And so, in that respect, I think the effects on the United States would be quite significant.  

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Mr. Chairman, Donna Borak with American Banker.  To talk about—further about banks, as you know, global regulators are meeting this week to finalize a proposal that would name the world’s most significantly banks and as well as a surcharge.  There are some that are arguing that regulators are going too far, too fast.  And I’m wondering, for regulators, you know, where is the line where you—to pass, where you go too far, and you do hurt credit lending and inevitably hurt the economy?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So I’ll be attending that meeting, and so I’ll have a chance to hear others’ views and to contribute to that discussion.  It’s only been two years since we had  11 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL the worst financial crisis certainly since the Great Depression and possibly in the history of the United States.  And the failure or near failure of large financial institutions was a major contributor to that crisis.  Since we can’t know exactly what threats will come in the future, probably the best all-purpose way of strengthening the balance sheets of banks and other financial institutions is by capital.  And I’m very supportive of increased capital to—and better quality capital—to help ensure that these banks will be stable and able to lend in the event of another crisis, which I hope we don’t, of course, ever see.  In terms of the SIFI surcharge, so-called, I think it’s also appropriate to have additional capital requirements for the largest and most systemically important institutions.  After all, it’s because their failure would have very deleterious effects in the financial system, we need to take extra steps to make sure that they will be very unlikely to fail.  In addition, it provides some more level playing field because, by having higher equity requirements, the largest institutions avoid some of the funding advantages that would otherwise accrue to firms that are viewed as being too big to fail.  So I think it’s very important to do that.  And we’ll be negotiating, discussing with our colleagues internationally what the appropriate number of firms is, what the appropriate criteria are, and what the amount of capital should be.  In choosing the amount of capital, we will certainly be trying to weigh off and balance, on the one hand, the need for extra safety of systemically important firms against the impacts on lending and so on.  Although I would note that, since systemically important firms are only part of the banking system, to the extent that they reduce their lending, some of that lending might go to other institutions.   In terms of going too far, you know, it’s very, very difficult to make a broad-based assessment of the overall impact of all of the rules and regulations.  But I would like to make clear that, both by law and by our internal practices, the Federal Reserve does cost-benefit  12 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL analysis of every rule that we write, and we publish those.  So we are looking at the cost-benefit for these regulations.  Moreover, we have worked with—the Federal Reserve has worked actively with the BIS, the Basel Committee, to do analyses of the effects of capital requirements, on the one hand, on the probability of a crisis, and on the other hand, on the cost of lending and the effect on growth.  Those studies have been published.  And if you look at them, you’ll see that we believe that the capital which has been imposed so far would significantly reduce the threat of a massive financial crisis and, on the other hand, have very small effects on growth.  So I don’t think we’re on the wrong side of that tradeoff at this point.  

[SECTION]

ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times.  Mr. Chairman, you now expect that both headline and core inflation would be close to your long-run objective in 2012 and 2013 while unemployment remains high.  Does that mean you think the medium-term tradeoff between inflation and growth has got worse?  And, furthermore, can I ask—Has the unexpected rise in core inflation changed your understanding of the output gap?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, to address the latter question first, that’s a possibility.  As you saw from the—but as you saw from the projections we just put out, the Committee—every member of the Committee sees the long-run unemployment rate—the NAIRU, as it’s called by economists—somewhere around 5½ percent, basically.  So that would suggest that the Committee still believes that the output gap is quite large.  With respect to core inflation, some of the effects, at least there, are also temporary.  To name two examples, the supply chain disruptions brought about by the Japanese disaster have led to a very significant increase in auto prices, both new and used automobiles, last month.  As these problems are resolved—and they appear to be very much on the way to being resolved—we would assume that the auto prices would come back down and incentives would be restored as competition increases and costs are  13 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL reduced.  So that’s one example.  Another would be the fact that energy prices have passed through to a number of—despite the fact that core is defined excluding energy, that’s only the energy, direct energy products—things like airfares, for example, which are very sensitive to the cost of jet fuel, are also a part of the core.  So you would imagine that, as the price of oil inflation.  So given that there’s still a large output gap, given that inflation expectations remain well anchored, given that some of the temporary factors affecting inflation, including core inflation, are likely to recede, I think it’s reasonable to think that core inflation will fall back towards mandate-consistent levels.  That being said, I think it’s the case, if you look at the projections that we have marked up a little bit, the near-term and core projections.  

[SECTION]

PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes, Fox Business, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Chairman, what is the extended period right now for exceptionally low fed funds rate—rates, given the recent developments in the U.S. and global economic picture?  Is it a year or two?  And under what conditions would the extended period be extended even longer?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, you know, the reason we use terms like “extended period” is not to be intentionally opaque.  The reason is that we don’t know exactly how long.  I think the—I think the thrust of “extended period” is that we believe we’re at least two or three meetings away from taking any further action, and I emphasize “at least.”  But depending on how the economy evolves, and inflation and unemployment, it could be, you know, significantly longer.  It will depend on how the economy and the economic outlook changes.  If we do get both improved job creation and inflation close to our—close to or even above our mandate-consistent level, then that would be a sign that we need to consider beginning an exit process.  But we’re not there at this point.  14 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

PETER BARNES.  But what about negative conditions—for example, the situation in Europe becoming a contagion situation?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, if the economy worsens and inflation remains relatively low, then we wouldn’t begin to exit, and, therefore, we wouldn’t change the language.  The expected length of keeping rates low would then be longer, but, again, we wouldn’t want to give explicit—we could, I suppose, but we have at least not chosen so far to give an explicit time frame, again because it’s our intention to continue to monitor the economy, revise our outlook—we just revised our outlook fairly significantly since April—and make a judgment based on the incoming data.  So we don’t want to commit ourselves necessarily to a fixed—a fixed time frame.  

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Mr. Chairman, Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.  Cool fan charts. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  So, all of you have to make policy projections on appropriate policy.  So to get to this world of 2013, when we have above-trend growth and unemployment falling and inflation at a really nice level, what would your appropriate policy be to get there?  Would it be an early gradual exit, a late steep exit, or no exit?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I don’t think it would be constructive for me to give you a tentative projection because, obviously, as I’ve indicated, there’s simply no alternative but to watch the incoming data and to make judgments both in terms of when the exit should begin, which, at this point, is going to depend on incoming data, but also what the slope of tightening would be, how quickly we would tighten.  So, you know, we all have estimates in our minds, but, you know, that’s a very far cry from saying that this is what’s going to happen.  In a sense, the FOMC has to forecast its own behavior in the same way it forecasts the economy.  And that  15 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL forecast can change.  And given developments in the economy, we might end up doing something different than what we currently think is most likely.  

[SECTION]

KEVIN HALL.  Kevin Hall of McClatchy Newspapers.  If I understand correctly, unlike your predecessor, you’re actually bringing your own forecast to the FOMC meeting.  As a first among equals, how did you fall in the central tendency?  Were you among the three that were excluded on the high end or the low end?  And on the range—where would you put yourself on the range of the forecasts as a first among equals?  And as a side note, I don’t think your predecessor did this.  Why did—what benefits do you get by bringing your own forecast?  And the—your predecessor made headlines recently, suggesting that we should urgently move back to the Clinton-era tax levels because of how bad the debt situation could get.  Without getting into the area of Congress, what they should or shouldn’t do, what would be the benefits or costs of moving back to a 1999 3 percentage point change in the marginal tax rates?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, in your first question, I’m a member of the FOMC, and so I have submitted my own forecasts.  I think I would characterize me as—myself as being pretty consistent with most of my colleagues.  I certainly am not taking an outsized extreme view in any way.  And, in particular, I do personally believe that the slowdown is at least partly temporary, and that we’ll see greater growth going forward.  At the same time, I did—I do think that, given that we can’t explain the entire slowdown, that the best guess would be that growth, at least in the near term, might be a little bit less than we anticipated.   On tax policy, you know, I think the main point I’d like to make—and as you know, I’m reluctant to get into specifics of tax and spending policy—the main point I’d like to make is that we do need very seriously and urgently to address the overall fiscal situation, in particular by taking a long-run perspective to do that.  Exactly how that’s done is really the responsibility of  16 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL Congress because there are different tradeoffs from different choices.  And, of course, those choices also reflect fundamental values in what—about what you think the government should do, how much resources the government should command through taxes, and so on.  So I don’t generally make recommendations about specifics.  But I do think, in my role as someone who’s extremely interested in financial stability, that addressing the medium- to long-term deficit problem is very urgent.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE FLEURY.  Michelle Fleury, BBC News.  Looking at your unemployment projections, it seems you expect weak growth—weak jobs growth going forward and then a return to normal, sort of, in the long run.  Does this mean, then, you don’t expect that there’s a structural issue here?  And, if not, can you sort of give us a time frame for sort of in the long run, when we return to normal?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we expect—as the projections show, we expect growth in the second half of this year and next year to be certainly faster than it’s been so far in 2011.  And as a result, we would expect to see healthier job creation numbers.  So we should see—if our forecast is correct, we’ll see payroll numbers improving relatively soon.   In terms of the unemployment rate, though, given that growth is not much above the long-run potential rate of growth—and we have in our projections an estimate of  2.5 to 2.8 percent, we haven’t really done much better than that—it takes growth faster than potential to bring down unemployment.  And since we’re not getting that, we project unemployment to come down very painfully slowly.  At some point, if growth picks up as we anticipate, job numbers will start getting better.  We’re still some years away from full employment in the sense of 5½ percent, say, and that’s, of course, very frustrating because it  17 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL means that many people will be out of work for a very extended time.  And that can have significant long-term consequences that concern me very much.  response just now, and given the Fed’s belief that the recent uptick inflation is transitory, why wouldn’t the Fed consider taking more action to stimulate growth?  And if it would consider that, would bond purchases be your preference, or would communications tactics, such as the one suggested by Jon, also be on the table as you consider how to get the economy growing again?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, there are a couple of considerations.  One, as I indicated before, is that the current outlook is significantly different than what we were facing in—in August of last year.  We no longer have a deflation risk.  Inflation is above—at the moment, is above target.  We expect it to fall, but we’re no longer—certainly not in any deflationary situation.  And notwithstanding the disappointing news recently, the labor market has been performing better than it was last year.  On top of that, we have an awful lot of uncertainty right now about how much of this slowdown is temporary, how much is permanent.  So that would suggest, all else equal, that a little bit of time to see what’s going to happen is—it would be useful in making policy decisions.  We’ll continue to look at the outlook and act, you know, as appropriately as the news comes in and the projections change.  We do have a number of ways of acting; none of them are without risks or costs.  We could, for example, do more securities purchases and structure them in different ways.  We could cut the interest on excess reserves that we pay to banks.  And as was suggested by an earlier question—several earlier questions, actually—Jon’s question about giving guidance on the balance sheet or by perhaps even giving a fixed date, you know, to define “extended period,” those are ways that we could  18 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL ease further if needed.  But, of course, all of these things are somewhat untested.  They have their own costs.  But we’d be prepared to take additional action, obviously, if conditions warranted.  

[SECTION]

AKIHIRO OKADA.  Mr. Chairman, I am Akihiro Okada with Yomiuri Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper.  During the Japanese lost decade in the 1990s, you strongly criticized Japan’s lack of policies.  Recently Larry Summers suggested in his column that the U.S. is in the middle of its own lost decade.  Based on those points with QE2 ending, what do you think of Japan’s experience and the reality facing the U.S.?  Are there any historical lessons that we should be reminded about?  Thank you.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I’m a little bit more sympathetic to central bankers now than I was 10 years ago.  I think it’s very important to understand that in my comments—both in my comment in the published comment a decade ago as well as in my speech in 2002 about deflation—my main point was that a determined central bank can always do something about deflation.  After all, inflation is a monetary phenomenon, a central bank can always create money, and so on.  I also argued—and I think it’s well understood that deflation, persistent deflation can be a very debilitating factor in—in growth and employment in an economy.  So we acted on that advice here in the United States, as I just described, in August, September of last year.  We could infer from, say, TIPS prices—inflation index bond prices—that investors saw something on the order of a one-third chance of outright deflation going forward.  So there was a significant risk there.  The securities purchases that we did were intended, in part, to end that risk of deflation.  And I think it’s widely agreed that we succeeded in ending that deflation risk.  I think also that our policies were constructive on the employment side.  This, I realize, is a bit more controversial.  But we did take actions as needed, even though we were at the zero lower  19 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL bound of interest rates, to address deflation.  So that was the thrust of my remarks 10 years ago.  And we’ve been consistent with that—with that approach.  

[SECTION]

STEVE BECKNER.  Mr. Chairman, Steve Beckner, Market News International.  Do you and your colleagues have a statistical trigger of any sorts, say, a particular level of unemployment or inflation at which you would begin the exit process?  If you do, wouldn’t it make sense to announce it?  If not, why not?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it’s pretty impossible to create a statistical trigger because we have currently 17 independent members of the FOMC.  Each has his or her own view on the outlook, on the efficacy of monetary policy, and on the risks to inflation and unemployment.  So we don’t have any such formula.  We have staff produce, you know, various scenarios, which give some indication of—given their projections of where the most likely outcomes, most likely points for a beginning of an exit would be.  But as I said earlier when I was asked about my own projections, those are very tentative, depend on a lot happening, depend on the forecasts evolving as expected, and are certainly subject to change as new information comes in. 

[SECTION]

DEREK KRAVITZ.  Derek Kravitz, Associated Press.  On your point about permanent factors, housing, back in February—actually, November, you had said that a second asset—a second round of asset purchases would go ahead and ease mortgage rates and make housing more affordable.  You’ve seen housing become more affordable; you’ve seen rates decline.  But you’re seeing underlying fundamentals in the sector still very weak—starts, sales, and prices.  Many economists have pushed back any and all economic forecasts for the sector to 2013–2014 for any meaningful rebound.  What could be done for that sector as far as—to stimulate growth?    20 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the housing sector is very important to the overall recovery, and so we’ve paid a lot of attention to that.  We did—as you point out, we did succeed in significantly lowering the mortgage rates.  So those who can get credit, together with the low prices of houses, are at—able to buy much more house than they could have a few years ago.   Unfortunately, there are problems, including the fact that credit standards for mortgages have tightened quite considerably so that roughly a bottom—the bottom third of people who might have qualified for a prime mortgage in terms of, say, FICO scores a few years ago cannot qualify today.  So that’s—that’s certainly an important problem.  There’s also evidently a lot of uncertainty about employment, about the economic recovery, and that’s affecting people’s willingness to make the commitment to buy a house.  So there are a number of fundamental factors which are slowing the housing market down, and they do present very difficult challenges.  The Fed is trying to address this in a number of ways.  Of course, our monetary policy is intended to try to promote employment and income gains, which, of course, will help housing demand.  As regulators, we have recently issued cease-and-desist orders to servicers to try and improve servicing practices.  We work with our regulated banks to ask them to do modifications where appropriate and to manage their REO—real estate owned—real estate in an economy-supportive way.   We’ve also—the Federal Reserve has also been very much involved in giving input to other agencies which have responsibilities for housing.  For example, we have provided advice to the Treasury on their modification programs.  In fact, I am—ex officio, I am the head of the oversight board for the TARP, which is—now mostly consists of HAMP, the housing program.  So, in that context, I’m kept well informed.  So the Federal Reserve is doing a lot and doing what it can.  I think otherwise I’d like to see just further efforts to—first of all, to modify loans where  21 of 22 June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL appropriate; to—and where not appropriate, to speed the process of foreclosure and disposition of the foreclosed homes in order to clear the market; get these homes out of the pipeline; and allow people to, you know, to operate in a market where they’re more confident that prices will be stable rather than falling.  It’s interesting now that—although house prices overall are sold on a distressed basis have much more stable prices than those which are being sold on a distressed basis.  And that suggests that, if we can reduce the current number and something of more than a third, maybe 40 percent of home sales which are on a distressed basis, that would do a lot to stabilizing the market and helping give people confidence that they can buy, and not be buying into a falling market.  Thank you very much.    22 of 22",Ben Bernanke,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
2,2011-11-02,"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Welcome.  In my opening remarks, I will briefly review today’s policy decision of the Federal Open our policy strategy.  I will then be glad to take your questions.   As indicated in its statement, the Committee decided today to maintain the policies that were initiated at previous meetings.  In particular, the Committee is keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013. The Committee will continue the program that we announced in September to extend the average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities by purchasing longer-term Treasury securities and selling an equal amount of shorter-term Treasury securities.  Our purchases of longer-term securities exert downward pressures on longer-term interest rates; at the same time, our guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate should limit the effect of our sales of shorter-term securities on shorter-term interest rates.  Consequently, this maturity extension program should foster more accommodative financial conditions, thereby helping support a stronger recovery without changing the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  In addition, to further ease conditions in mortgage markets, we are continuing our previously announced program in which the principal payments from our holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities are being reinvested in agency MBS.  The Committee regularly reviews the size and composition of our securities holdings, and we are prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.    1 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL In conjunction with today’s meeting, the FOMC participants submitted projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2014 and over the longer run.  The central tendencies and ranges of those projections are depicted in the figures that have been distributed.  The longer-run projections—shown at the right side of each figure—represent participants’ assessments of the rate to which each variable will converge, over time, assuming appropriate monetary policy and no further shocks to the economy.   The longer-run projections for growth of real GDP have a central tendency of 2.4 to 2.7 percent, and the longer-run projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.  These projections can be interpreted, respectively, as participants’ estimates of the economy’s normal or trend rate of growth and its normal unemployment rate over the longer run.  Because the economy's longer- run normal rates of output growth and unemployment are determined largely by nonmonetary factors that may evolve over time and that cannot often be directly measured, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to revision.   The central tendency of the longer-run projections for inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent.  The inflation outlook over the longer run is determined almost entirely by monetary policy, and hence these projections essentially reflect participants’ judgments about the inflation rate that is most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate of fostering maximum employment and stable prices.  In effect, the “mandate-consistent” inflation rate is judged to be 2 percent or a bit less.   I turn now to the Committee’s economic outlook.  Participants’ projections for real GDP for 2011 as a whole have a central tendency of 1.6 to 1.7 percent.  Output growth strengthened during the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that had weighed on  2 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL growth earlier in the year.  In particular, global supply chain disruptions associated with the natural disaster in Japan have diminished.  Moreover, the prices of oil and other commodities have come down from their peaks, easing strains on household budgets and contributing to a somewhat faster pace of consumer spending in recent months.   The Committee expects only a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters, reflecting ongoing drags from the troubled housing sector, still-tight credit conditions for many households and smaller businesses, volatility in financial markets, fiscal consolidation at all levels of government, and other factors.  Looking further ahead, economic growth is expected to pick up somewhat as a result of improving financial conditions, strengthening consumer and business confidence, and the continuation of a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ growth projections picks up gradually from 2.5 to 2.9 percent in 2012 to 3.0 to 3.9 percent by 2014.   In light of the anticipated moderate pace of economic recovery, the Committee expects that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually over coming quarters.  Participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2012 have a central tendency of 8.5 to 8.7 percent—only about ½ percentage point lower than the latest monthly reading of 9.1 percent.  The unemployment rate is expected to climb further to 6.8 to 7.7 percent by the fourth quarter of 2014—still well above participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.   In short, while we still expect that economic activity and labor market conditions will improve gradually over time, the pace of progress is likely to be frustratingly slow.  Moreover, there are significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  Most notably, concerns about European fiscal and banking issues have contributed to strains in global financial markets, which  3 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL have likely had adverse effects on confidence and growth.  European leaders have recently announced a number of steps to address those issues.  We will continue to monitor European developments closely.   I’ll turn now to the outlook for inflation.  The prices of oil and other commodities rose sharply earlier this year.  Consumer inflation consequently picked up over the first half of 2011, reflecting higher prices of gasoline, food, and other goods and services for which producers passed higher input costs along to their customers.  In addition, prices of motor vehicles surged in response to the global supply disruptions associated with the disaster in Japan.  However, inflation appears to have moderated as those transitory influences have waned, and as low levels of resource utilization constrain rises in prices and wages.  Furthermore, survey measures and Consequently, the Committee anticipates that, over coming quarters, inflation will settle at or below its mandate-consistent rate of 2 percent or a bit less.  Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ inflation projections is 2.7 to 2.9 percent for this year but declines to 1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and remains subdued through 2014.  The Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.   The current economic outlook provides important context for understanding today’s policy decision.  The Committee’s mandate from the Congress is to seek maximum employment and price stability.  With unemployment well above normal levels and expected to decline only slowly, and with inflation expected to remain at or below mandate-consistent levels, the Committee decided today to maintain the current high degree of monetary policy accommodation.  We will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming  4 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL information, and we are prepared to employ our tools as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.   Finally, I would like to note that the Committee strives to explain its monetary policy public communications.  Specifically, we have been engaging in a series of discussions about potential approaches to providing the public additional information about our monetary policy goals and policy strategy, as well as about our outlook for the economy and for the future stance of monetary policy.  However, no decisions about such approaches were made at this meeting.   Thank you for your patience, and I would be happy to take your questions.

STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, over the past several months, it seems there’s been increasing criticism of the Fed’s policy.  You received a letter on the eve of the September meeting urging you not to take action from the GOP leadership.  Several GOP presidential candidates have criticized Fed policy in the debates.  On the first issue, do you feel that crossed the line?  Was it appropriate in terms of the concepts of the Fed’s independence?  On the second question, what are the GOP presidential candidates not hearing or understanding about Fed policy, in your opinion?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, politics is politics, and the Federal Reserve tries to stay nonpartisan and out of those debates.  I mean, our job is to do the best we can for the U.S. economy, to do what we can to promote our mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and although we must be accountable to the Congress over the longer term, in the short term, it’s very important that the Fed be free from political pressures.  And therefore, we are going to make our decisions based on what’s good for the economy, and we’re not going to take any politics into account.    5 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL Now, the concerns that have been expressed relate to the possibility that the Fed’s highly expansionary policies might be contributing to inflation risk.  I would simply point to the record.  If you look back for the last five years, inflation—although it’s been volatile because of commodity price fluctuations—has averaged about 2 percent, which is close to a reasonable definition of price stability, whereas the area where we have fallen short, obviously, is on the unemployment side.  So I think that criticisms based on the concern about inflation have so far, at least, not proved to be very valid.   

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Was the letter appropriate? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I’m not going to comment on that.  I—we listen to everybody’s input, and the most important thing is that we are free to make the decision based on the interest of the American people, what’s in the interest of the economy, and that’s what we’re going to do. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Has the Fed discussed the idea of nominal GDP targeting?  And what are your views on the advantages and disadvantages of that approach?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So the Fed’s mandate is, of course, a dual mandate.  We have a mandate for both employment and for price stability, and we have a framework in place that allows us to communicate and to think about the two sides of that mandate.  We talked today—or yesterday, actually—about nominal GDP as an indicator, as an information variable, as something to add to the list of variables that we think about, and it was a very interesting discussion.  However, we think that within the existing framework that we have, which looks at both sides of the mandate, not just some combination of the two, we can communicate whatever we need to communicate about future monetary policy.  So we are not contemplating at this  6 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL date—at this time—any radical change in framework.  We are going to stay within the dual-mandate approach that we’ve been using until this point.   

[SECTION]

JENNIFER LIBERTO.  Chairman, you’ve said in the past you understand some of the anger on display with the Occupy Wall Street protesters.  And a lot of the anger is directed at the Fed, with some protesters saying that the Fed is part of the problem, that the Fed preserves the financial system and promotes income inequality.  Can—are the protesters right?  Is the Fed part of the problem?  And, secondarily, can the Fed do anything to promote a more equitable economy?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as I’ve said before, I certainly understand that many people are dissatisfied with the state of the economy.  I’m dissatisfied with the state of the economy.  Unemployment is far too high.  Inequality, which is not a new phenomenon, has been going on—increases in inequality have been going on for at least 30 years, but obviously as that has continued, we now have a more unequal society than we’ve had in the past.  So again, I fully sympathize with the notion that the economy is not performing the way we would like it to be, and in that respect, the concerns that people express across the spectrum are understandable.   I think that the concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions.  The Federal Reserve was involved, obviously, in trying to stabilize the financial system in 2008 and 2009.  A very simplistic interpretation of that was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve, you know, bankers’ salaries.  That is obviously not the case.  What we were doing is trying to protect the financial system in order to prevent a serious collapse of both the financial system and the American economy.  We needed to take those steps.  If we hadn’t taken them, the consequences would have been dire.  And not everybody understands that, and therefore they sometimes misunderstand our motives.  Our motives are strictly to do what’s in the interest of  7 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL the broad public, and I believe that our efforts to stabilize the financial system, which ultimately proved successful, were very much in the interest of the broad public.   With respect to the current economy, as I described earlier, we are currently continuing with our accommodative monetary policy.  We are trying to do our best to support economic growth and job creation.  I think it would be helpful if we could get assistance from some other parts of the government to work with us, to help create more jobs.  But certainly, we are doing our part to try to create more jobs and more opportunities in America.   With respect to inequality, I think the best way to address inequality is to create jobs.  It gives people opportunities.  It gives people a chance to earn income, gain experience, and to ultimately earn more.  But that’s an indirect approach; that’s really the only way the Fed can address inequality per se.   

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Mr. Chairman, the Fed’s forecast for 2013 shows the unemployment rate finishing the year between 7.8 and 8.2 percent.  The statement says that short-term rates will stay near their current levels at least through mid-2013.  Does that suggest that the Fed could conceive of raising short-term interest rates before unemployment even gets to 8 percent or much lower?  And if not, could you explain how people should interpret those two messages?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the statement says “at least” mid-2013.  So, clearly, it could well be some point beyond that, and markets are currently anticipating a somewhat later liftoff.  One of the things we discussed yesterday in our communications discussion was how we might further clarify that part of the statement and try to provide more information about what conditions would prevail at the time that we would be considering raising rates.  But we haven’t come to that point yet, but we certainly would like to provide more clarity about that.  But again,  8 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL let me emphasize that what we are saying now is “at least”; there’s no implication that we would necessarily move in mid-2013 with those conditions prevailing that you described.   

[SECTION]

PEDRO DACOSTA.  Pedro DaCosta from Reuters.  Mr. Chairman, what is your appetite for a renewed push into large-scale mortgage-backed securities purchases?  The Fed had stated the intention to move the structure of its balance sheet more to its original, you know, Treasuries-only composition.  But recently, it revived the MBS program through the reinvestments, and folks like Governor Tarullo and William Dudley have raised the possibility of further large-scale asset purchases on the MBS side.  Could you comment on your views on that particular proposal?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, I’ll be glad to.  You were absolutely correct—first, that ultimately we would like to return our portfolio to Treasuries only.  That may be some time down the road at this point.  You’re also correct that as part of our policy action at the last meeting, we began to reinvest mortgage-backed securities and agency debt back into  mortgage-backed securities, thereby providing some additional support for the mortgage market.  The housing sector is a very important sector.  It’s—the problems in that sector are clearly a big reason why our economy is not recovering more quickly.  So I do think that purchases of mortgage-backed securities is a viable option.  It’s certainly something we would consider if conditions were appropriate.  So the answer is yes, we would certainly look at that.  

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Greg Robb, MarketWatch.com.  At the moment now, banks are holding hundreds of billions of dollars in excess reserves, and at the same time, corporations seem to be holding lots of cash on the—and foreigners—at the same time, foreigners keep investing a lot of money in the United States.  The current account deficit  9 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL is very large.  Could you shed some light on that situation?  Is there something that foreigners know that U.S. companies don’t about investing in the U.S.?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, most of the—a great deal of the investment in the U.S. takes the form of purchases of U.S. government debt in Treasury securities.  And that, in turn, reflects the desire for the liquidity and safety provided by the U.S. Treasury market.  For example, as you know, two of the largest holders of U.S. Treasury securities are China and Japan, who hold those securities primarily as foreign exchange reserves and, in the case of China, in an effort to keep their exchange rate from appreciating too quickly.  So, I was—while it’s good that foreign central banks and so on have the confidence to buy U.S. Treasuries, it’s not quite the same as investing in plant and equipment.  We’ve seen a little bit of improvement there, but it’s still obviously too low to be consistent with a full employment economy.   

[SECTION]

PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes, Fox Business.  Sir, could you comment on the failure of MF Global, which is a primary dealer?  And specifically, the Financial Times is reporting that the leverage ratio at MF Global was 40 to 1.  Were you aware of that?  Did the Fed approve of that?  Is that an acceptable leverage ratio, particularly since the financial crisis?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Certainly.  The New York Federal Reserve Bank approved MF Global to be a primary dealer; I believe it was in February of this year.  At that time, the company met the criteria that had been set forth in terms of management, financial condition, capacity, and so on to qualify to be a primary dealer.  We have set those standards in a way that would allow smaller firms like MF Global to participate in the primary dealer market.  But I would like to emphasize, I guess, a couple of points.  First, we are not the regulators of MF Global.  That’s done by the SEC and the CFTC, so we do not have ongoing insight into developments within the company.  And secondly, again, making them a primary dealer did not  10 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL in any way constitute a seal of approval.  In fact, the New York Fed’s website contains a statement pretty much to that effect.  So, they were a primary dealer, we stopped trading with them before they failed, and we’ve suffered no losses or other consequences from our transactions with the company.  Again, in terms of your question about leverage and financial condition, the company declined very, very quickly based on, apparently, a small number of large bets.  As far as I know we were not aware of that, but again, to emphasize, we were not—we are not the overseers, the regulators of that company.   

[SECTION]

PEDRO DACOSTA.  Can I just ask whether you see it as an isolated case or whether this is the start of something broader?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The question is, Was that an isolated case?   It appears to be an idiosyncratic case, and we’re monitoring the possible impacts on funding markets and elsewhere.  And, so far, we’ve not seen any significant impact on financial stability.   

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  To follow up on that question, should the Fed be, on an ongoing basis, monitoring its primary dealers?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The question is, Should the Fed be monitoring its primary dealers?  Only if the Fed is the supervisor.  In this case, the combination of a  broker–dealer and a futures commission merchant imply that the SEC and the CFTC are the appropriate supervisors.  They would not have qualified—this company would not have qualified as a SIFI under the provisional guidance issued by the FSOC, so there’s no basis at this point for the Fed to be the overseer of that, of those companies.   

[SECTION]

NEIL IRWIN.  Neil Irwin with the Washington Post.  Mr. Chairman, this is the third straight set of economic projections you’ve released that have downgraded forecasts for growth and for employment.  I wonder, is there some systematic error, some blind spot that’s behind  11 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL these, kind of, overly optimistic forecasts?  What are you doing internally to understand what you got wrong the last few projections?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it’s a perfectly fair question.  And, you know, we spend a lot of time reviewing those errors.  The staff, in particular, presents us with information on forecast errors and on revisions, et cetera, and so we look at that very carefully.  I think it’s clear that—in retrospect, that the severity of the financial crisis and a number of other problems, including the dysfunction of the housing market, have been more severe and more persistent than we initially believed, and that, together with a number of other phenomena like deleveraging by the household sector and so on, has slowed the pace of recovery.  So, yes, we have again downgraded the medium-term forecast.  Evidently, the forces—you know, the drags on the recovery were stronger than we thought.   I would add, however, though, that although I think it’s very important to look at the fundamental factors affecting the recovery, there’ve been some elements of bad luck.  For example, this year, the combination of the natural disaster in Japan which had global impacts in terms of growth, oil price increases, the European debt crisis, which was not anticipated to be as severe and create as much volatility as it has in financial markets—all those things have been negatives for growth, and they do explain at least part of the downward revision.   

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee with Bloomberg Television.  Many Americans wonder what the Fed has actually accomplished with its monetary policy actions since about QE2.  Fed officials like to talk about the effect they’ve had on interest rates, but the economy seems insensitive to interest rates these days.  Can you explain what you have managed to accomplish?  Can you tell us whether you feel your mandate requires you to do anything you can think of on an ongoing basis until some targets are met?  And can you explain to the average  12 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL American why you’re doing what you’re doing?  And do you think that you risk credibility if the average American doesn’t see some sort of improvement in the economy?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, it’s a fair question.  I would first say that monetary policy is having effects on the economy.  And we’ve talked about the effects on asset prices, but we have continued to analyze the effects of changes in interest rates, for example, on decisions like investment or car purchases.  One area where monetary policy has been blunted—the effects have been blunted—has been the mortgage market, where very tight credit standards have prevented many people from purchasing or refinancing their homes, and therefore the low mortgage rates that we’ve achieved have not been as effective as we had hoped.  So, monetary policy may be somewhat less powerful in the current context than it has been in the past, but nevertheless, it is affecting economic growth and job creation.   If you ask about the accomplishments, I would first of all mention a very important one, which is that we have kept inflation close to 2 percent, on average, which both has avoided the problems of high inflation but also very importantly has avoided the risk of deflation.  And we’ve seen in other countries, in other contexts, that deflation can be a very pernicious problem and very difficult to get out of once you are there.  So we have been able to achieve, on average, stable prices.   With respect to growth, I think that our policies, including the cutting of rates to zero in were very important for helping to explain why the economy stopped contracting and began to grow again in the middle of 2009.  I think there’s a lot of evidence that that did promote growth and job creation.  I would argue that we’ve also been successful with some of the later actions that we’ve taken, although it’s early to say for things like the maturity extension program, but we  13 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL always face the problem of asking the question, Well, where would we be without these policies?  And our best estimates are that—absent the support of monetary policy, that the economy would be in a much deeper ditch and that unemployment would be much higher than it is.  That being said, you know, again, people rightly recognize that we have not yet gotten the economy back to where we want it to be, and their dissatisfaction is perfectly understandable.  Yes, I do think that with—you know, that we do need to do whatever we can to move the economy towards price stability and maximum employment.  We’ll continue to do that so long as the tools that we have are efficacious and that they don’t have costs or risks or negative side effects that are worse than the benefits.  We’ll always be making that evaluation.   

[SECTION]

GREG IP.  Greg Ip with the Economist.  In response to Pedro’s question, you said you would consider more MBS purchases when the conditions were appropriate.  Could you elaborate on what conditions would be appropriate to do additional large-scale asset purchases, what your reaction function is right now?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I don’t think I can be as precise as you would like.  I—the MBS purchases and Treasury securities purchases are one set of tools that we have.  The other set of tools that we have are communication tools, which essentially tie interest rate are basically the two tools that we have, and we need to continue to work on how best to use them and in what combination to use them to achieve our objectives.   In terms of when we would use these, I think all I can say is that the Committee will have to look at the outlook, and if it judges that we are falling sufficiently far short of our objectives in terms of inflation falling at or below its target and growth being insufficient, and that we believe that monetary stimulus would be beneficial, you know, then the Committee obviously would try  14 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL to take corrective action.  But I can’t—you know, it’s a Committee decision, we’ll have to look at the outlook.  But we remain prepared to take action as appropriate to make sure the recovery continues, to make sure that we have stable prices in the U.S.   

[SECTION]

JOSHUA ZUMBRUN.  Josh Zumbrun from Bloomberg.  Your colleague Daniel Tarullo phrased this as, “Further action would be required in the absence of favorable developments.”  Does that mean that, looking at the forecast tables we have here today, that if we don’t see improvement from what’s in those tables, that further action would be required? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Again, I can’t speak for my colleagues on the Committee.  I will say that that forecast we have is satisfactory in one dimension, in the sense that inflation remains low and stable, but it is very unsatisfactory in terms of the rate of growth of the economy, the rate at which unemployment comes down.  So I think the judgment we’re going to have to make is, do the tools we have—are those tools likely to be sufficiently effective?  Or do they bear costs and risks that would make them less effective or not worth using?  So it’s a judgment we’re going to have to continue to make.  We’re going to have to continue to evaluate the outlook.  But again, I really can’t speak for my colleagues until we have looked at the entire array of data and made a decision about that.   

[SECTION]

JOHN BERRY.  John Berry, Fiscal Times.  In the European debt deal that may or may not come to pass, it’s been said that the banks operating there—the big banks—have all agreed that a 9 percent Tier 1 capital ratio is appropriate.  A lot of U.S. banks have been arguing that they can’t afford to do that.  It will reduce lending, but it would also put them at a competitive disadvantage internationally.  With that happening in Europe, do you think it’s appropriate that the big banks in the U.S. should accept such a Tier 1 capital requirement, and how does that development stand at this point?     15 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we are committed to, and are in the process of, implementing Basel III, which has a basic requirement including a buffer of 7 percent, and then additional surcharges for the largest institutions.  We think that’s an appropriate framework.  I’m not sure that the 9 percent that Europeans are talking about is really comparable to this, to the capital requirements that we are imposing, or will be imposing, on U.S. banks.  For example, the composition of their capital is not, as far as I understand, purely common equity.  I do not know what risk weights are being applied to the assets.  So there are a number of questions of comparability.  My expectation and hope is that—over the medium term, that the Europeans who agreed to the Basel III conditions will ensure that their banks meet the Basel III standards over time.  Of course, that’s being phased in over a number of years so as not to jeopardize in any way the recovery.  But, over the remainder of this decade, we anticipate implementing all of the key elements of Basel III in the United States.   

[SECTION]

LUCA DILEO.  Luca DiLeo with Dow Jones.  Mr. Chairman, you’ve partly addressed this, but there’s something I still fail to understand.  Given that your forecast is still so gloomy for employment through 2014, given that you’re not worried about inflation, and given that you said that MBS is a viable option, why not act today?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So, as you point out, our forecast is not a very satisfactory one in the sense that unemployment is very high and growth is very slow.  We have taken a lot of actions.  Let me be very clear that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy is highly accommodative now—we brought rates close to zero, we have done $2 trillion worth of asset purchases, we have made commitments about rates, we’ve extended the maturity of our portfolio—so we have taken a lot of steps, including steps at the last two meetings, so we are being very aggressive in providing monetary accommodation.  I was asked before about  16 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL conditions for further accommodation.  Well, we are prepared to do that, and we will continue to observe, you know, how the economy evolves.  You know, what we have is a projection; there’s a lot of uncertainty there.  And so it will be very important to see, you know, what actually happens in terms of financial market conditions and economic growth.  So, but we are prepared to take further action.  We’ve already taken quite a bit of action, but we’re prepared to do more, and we have the tools to do more if that’s appropriate.  Again, while I do not shirk the responsibility of the Fed having to do what it can to meet its mandate, obviously, a broad range of policies can affect growth and employment, and I hope that there will be a range of actions that will complement and supplement the Federal Reserve’s efforts.

JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the LA Times.  You mentioned before the streak of bad luck that struck the economy earlier this year.  With the latest developments in Europe this week, where the debt deal seemingly was done and now the rug was pulled out, are you getting the sense that this economy just can’t catch a break?  And how would you advise average Americans to deal with these continued shocks to the economy and to the financial 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I don’t want to make excuses.  Again, we did overestimate the pace of recovery for some fundamental reasons having to do with, as I mentioned, the time taken to achieve financial repair, the state of the housing market, and so on.  But that being said, as I indicated earlier, there has been a certain amount of bad luck, and I think the volatility in financial markets associated with the European situation has been—along with volatility associated with the U.S. fiscal conditions, has been a drag on recovery.  I think it’s part of the reason why the second half of 2011 was less strong than we anticipated when I was here at the last press conference in June.  So there has been that concern.  It’s showing up in Americans’  17 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL confidence and sentiment.  You can see that right now consumer confidence is about where it was in the depths of recession; that’s very discouraging.  To some extent, at least, it will be a drag on consumer’s willingness to spend and to invest.   My best advice to Americans is to continue to live your lives, though, and to continue to think about your personal situation and try to make smart decisions based on your own financial position.  Clearly, Americans are trying to improve their balance sheets; they’re trying to pay down debt.  That’s, of course, important.  At the same time, you want to make smart decisions, you want to make good investments, you want to budget properly.  So financial literacy is a big part of this, and lack of financial literacy was one of the things that got us into this mess in the first place.  So I would advise people to try to be smart about their finances.  Unfortunately, we can’t disassociate ourselves from Europe; the things that are happening there do affect us, and that’s an unfortunate fact.  I hope very much that the Europeans will find a set of solutions that will allow markets to calm down and take off some of the headwinds from the U.S. economy.   

[SECTION]

ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times.  Mr. Chairman, could you explain the menu of options that the Committee has for improving its communication about when it might raise interest rates and what the conditions are in which it might do that?  For example, might it makes sense for the Fed to publish a forecast of its own future interest rates, and what’s the advantages and disadvantages of that?  Thank you.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, as I noted in my opening remarks, no decisions have been made, so I want to be very clear that no final—you know, there is no final outcome here in this discussion.  But clearly, there’s a range of things that we can do.  We can provide more information about our objectives, for example.  We could provide information about where we want inflation to be in the long term, for example.  We can also provide information about the  18 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL future path of interest rates, which we’ve done to some extent via our “mid-2013” language in the statement.  An alternative approach, which Charlie Evans and others have suggested, is to tie that to economic conditions and to provide more information about under what circumstances we would raise rates.  That is certainly something that we have discussed and I think is an interesting alternative.  There’s a lot of interest in using the survey of economic projections in constructive ways as we have up until now to provide information to the public about our plans.  And in particular, using the SEP as a way of giving information about our future policy decisions is something that’s on the table.  There’s no decision made about that, but that’s one direction that we might find productive.   

[SECTION]

MICHELLE FLEURY.  Michelle Fleury, BBC News.  You mentioned, obviously, that Europe and what’s happening there has an impact here on the U.S. economy.  To what degree can the Fed do little more than react to events abroad?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it is a bit frustrating.  Obviously, the key ultimately it’s their responsibility to find solutions to this very difficult problem.  Of course, I and the Treasury Secretary and other economic policymakers in United States do confer and meet with European policymakers on a regular basis, and we give our advice, for what it’s worth—sometimes they take it, sometimes they don’t.  But, obviously, they’re the ones who have to make those decisions.  So what we can do, really, is only a couple of things.  One is that we can look at our own financial institutions and try to assess the exposures and the linkages between our institutions and those in Europe and the sovereign debt in Europe, and we’ve been doing that on a consistent basis.  We’ve looked also, of course, with other regulators at money  19 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL So that’s one thing that we can do.  And the other thing that we can do is stand ready, if necessary, to provide whatever support the broader economy needs and the financial system needs, should things worsen.  I mean, we are hopeful that the latest measures, vigorously implemented, will indeed ultimately reduce these stresses, but in the case that things do get worse, both monetary policy and our policies of lender of last resort are available to insulate the U.S. economy from the effects.

KATHERINE LEWIS.  Hi, Katherine Lewis for Bankrate.com.  Can you talk about what impact you’ve seen from Operation Twist on longer-term CD rates and investment-grade bond yields?  And do you have any message for people who are relying on those kinds of instruments for income?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.  It’s a little bit early to fully assess the effects of what we call the maturity extension program.  But it does seem to be having, at least in a preliminary sense—it does seem to be having the intended effect of lowering longer-term interest rates and twisting the yield curve, as was anticipated.  That, in turn, should lead to still lower mortgage rates and other interest rates which are relevant to the economy.  We are quite aware that very low interest rates, particularly for a protracted period, do have costs for a lot of people.  They have costs for savers.  We have complaints from banks that complain that their net interest a protracted period require them to make larger contributions.  So we are aware of those concerns, and we take them very seriously.   I think the response is, though, that there is a greater good here, which is the health and recovery of the U.S. economy, and for that purpose we’ve been keeping monetary policy conditions accommodative, trying to support the recovery, trying to support job creation.  After  20 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL all, savers are not going to get very good returns in an economy which is in a deep recession.  I mean, ultimately, if you want to earn money on your investments, you have to invest in an economy which is growing.  And so, we believe that our policy will ultimately benefit not just workers and firms and households in general, but will benefit savers as well, as the returns that they can earn on their investments will improve with the improvement in the economy.

DARREN GERSH.  Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report.  Given how hard it has been to bring down unemployment in the past, why are you confident you have the tools to bring it down in the future?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we have the ability to provide more stimulus and accommodation.  We believe that a good bit of the unemployment that we are seeing is what economists would call cyclical unemployment—that is, unemployment arising because of inadequate demand in the economy.  If that’s the case, then a monetary policy—by lowering interest rates, making financial conditions more accommodative—should stimulate demand, should stimulate spending, and over a period of time, that will help bring down cyclical unemployment.  That is something that we know from a lot of experience, and, although it’s been a very slow process here, there’s no reason to think that the same basic effect will not work in this case as well.   Now, it’s also possible that part of the increase in unemployment reflects so-called structural factors—mismatches between worker skills and job opportunities, loss of skills, geographical mismatch, et cetera.  And to the extent that that’s the case, then monetary policy is much less effective because in that case, only other kinds of labor market policies really can make progress against that type of unemployment.  But again, I do think that a considerable part of the unemployment that we are seeing is cyclical and is thus amenable to monetary policy.  21 of 22 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL Final comment:  Cyclical unemployment, left untreated, so to speak, for a long time can become structural unemployment as people lose skills, as they lose attachment to the labor force, as their work networks dry up and so on.  So in that respect, it’s important for us to try to address the unemployment problem in a sense while it’s still amenable to monetary policy.

BRAIMOH ODION-ESENE.  Braimoh Odion-Esene, Market News International.  You mentioned that the Fed has the tools and stands ready to use it.  But given that in the statement it says that the Committee saw growth strengthened somewhat in the third quarter, is it fair to say that the FOMC is less aggressively considering more policy accommodation, given the improvement they saw in the third quarter?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We did see some improvement in the third quarter, a modest improvement.  We saw, for example, stronger consumption spending, a reasonable amount of capital investment, lower inventories, therefore suggesting more production in the fourth quarter, so it looks like the fourth quarter as well will be a moderate-growth quarter.  So there was some improvement—some improvement, at least early in the period, in financial acknowledging in our statement, that’s true.  But as has been noted, the medium-term outlook relative to our June projections has been downgraded, and the outlook remains unsatisfactory over the next few years.  And we’ll continue to ask ourselves whether or not additional stimulus or additional actions can provide a better outcome, and that’s certainly something that remains on the table and we’ll continue to evaluate as we go forward.   Thank you.     22 of 22",Ben Bernanke,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
3,2012-01-25,"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon and welcome.   In my opening remarks I will briefly review today’s policy decision by the Federal Open to you regarding the Committee’s longer-run policy goals and strategy.  And finally, I’ll place today’s policy decision in the context of our economic projections and our assessments of the appropriate path of monetary policy.  And I’ll then, of course, be glad to take your questions.   As indicated in the statement released earlier this afternoon, to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with our statutory mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least until late 2014.  To provide support for the recovery in the context of price stability, the Committee will also continue the program that we announced in September to extend the average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities.   Following careful deliberations, Committee participants have reached broad agreement on a statement that sets forth our longer-run goals and policy strategy.  This statement should not be interpreted as indicating any change in how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy.  Rather, its purpose is to increase the transparency and predictability of policy.  There is today widespread agreement that clear and transparent central bank communications facilitate well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduce economic and financial 1 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  uncertainty, increase the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhance accountability to the  public.   The statement begins by noting the Committee’s firm commitment to fulfill our statutory mandate of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.  Since monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag, our decisions appropriately reflect the Committee’s longer-run goals, our medium-term outlook, and our assessment of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of our goals.   An important aspect of policy transparency is clarity about policy objectives.  With respect to the objective of price stability, it is essential to recognize that the inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation.  The Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with our statutory mandate.  Over time, a higher inflation rate would reduce the public’s ability to make accurate longer-term economic and financial decisions, whereas a lower inflation rate would be associated with an elevated probability of falling into deflation, which can lead to significant economic problems.  Clearly communicating to the public this 2 percent goal for inflation over the longer run should help foster price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and will enhance the Committee’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.   Maximum employment stands on an equal footing with price stability as an objective of monetary policy.  A difference with price stability is that the maximum level of employment in a given economy is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and 2 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  dynamics of the labor market, including demographic trends, the pace of technological innovation, and a variety of other influences, including a range of economic policies.  Because monetary policy does not determine the maximum level of employment that the economy can sustain in the longer term, and since many of the determinants of maximum employment may change over time or may not be directly measurable, it is not feasible for any central bank to specify a fixed goal for the longer-run level of employment.   Although the Committee cannot freely choose a longer-run goal for employment, it can estimate the level of maximum employment and use that estimate to inform its policy decisions.  The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making its assessments of maximum employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision over time.  For example, in the latest set of projections that have been distributed to you, Committee participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment have a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 6.0 percent—roughly unchanged from last January but higher than the corresponding interval several years ago.  As I noted, the level of maximum employment is not immutable; in particular, it could be increased by effective policies, such as education and training that improve workforce skills.  If the Committee’s assessments pointed to an increase in the maximum attainable level of employment, our policy strategy would be modified appropriately to aim at the higher level.   In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its mandate-consistent rate and deviations of employment from our assessments of its maximum level.  These dual objectives are generally complementary.  For example, under present circumstances, in which the unemployment rate is elevated and the inflation outlook is subdued, the Committee judges that sustaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is 3 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  consistent with promoting both objectives.  And in the longer term, low and stable inflation can help promote healthy growth in output and employment.   Of course, circumstances may sometimes arise in which the dual objectives are not complementary.  In such cases, the Committee follows a balanced approach in promoting these two objectives, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and potentially different time horizons over which inflation and employment are projected to return to levels judged consistent with our mandate.  In other words, the Committee always treats its primary objectives of price stability and maximum employment symmetrically, and the stance of policy at any given time is determined by the size, social cost, and expected evolution of the deviations of each of the Committee’s policy objectives from its desired level.   I will now turn to the economic projections of the 17 FOMC participants—that is, 5 Board members and 12 Reserve Bank presidents—submitted in conjunction with today’s meeting.  The central tendencies and ranges of those projections for the years 2011 to 2014 and over the longer run are depicted in the figures that have been distributed.  The longer-run projections—shown at the right of each figure—represent participants’ assessments of the rate to which each variable will converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.   Incoming information suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately, notwithstanding some slowing in global growth.  The Committee expects the pace of economic growth to be, over coming quarters—to be moderate over coming quarters, reflecting ongoing drags from the housing sector and still-tight credit conditions for many households and smaller businesses.  Specifically, participants’ projections for the growth rate of real gross domestic 4 of 29 January 25, 2012 FINAL  product in 2012 have a central tendency of 2.2 to 2.7 percent.  Strains in global financial markets Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   continue to pose significant downside risks to that outlook.   Looking further ahead, economic activity is expected to accelerate gradually in conjunction with strengthening consumer and business confidence, improving financial conditions, and the continuation of a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.  Specifically, participants’ GDP projections for 2013 have a central tendency of 2.8 to 3.2 percent, and their projections for 2014 have a central tendency of 3.3 to 4.0 percent, noticeably higher than the central tendency of 2.3 to 2.6 percent for their longer-run growth projections.   A number of recent indicators point to some further improvement in overall labor market conditions, but the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Moreover, in light of the anticipated modest pace of economic recovery, the Committee expects that over coming quarters the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward its mandate-consistent levels.  Indeed, participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency of 8.2 to 8.5 percent that is little different from the latest monthly reading of 8.5 percent.  With economic growth expected to pick up somewhat over time, the unemployment rate is expected to decline to 6.7 to 7.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2014—still well above participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.   I’ll turn now to the outlook for inflation.  The prices of oil and other commodities have generally flattened out or turned downward over the past couple of quarters, while low levels of resource utilization have continued to constrain the growth of labor costs.  Consequently, consumer price inflation—which surged in the first half of last year—has been subdued in recent months.  Survey measures and financial market indicators imply that longer-term inflation 5 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  expectations have remained stable.  Over coming quarters, the Committee anticipates that inflation will run at or below levels consistent with the mandate-consistent rate of 2 percent.  Specifically, participants’ inflation projections have a central tendency of 1.4 to 1.8 percent for 2012 and remain subdued at around 1½ to 2 percent through 2014.   As a further step in enhancing the clarity of our communications, the Committee recently policy—that is, the path of policy that each participant judges as most likely to foster mandate-consistent outcomes for employment and inflation if the economy evolves as expected.  These judgments about future policy underlie the participants’ projections of growth, unemployment, and inflation that I just described.  Rather—excuse me—Importantly, these policy assessments should not be viewed as unconditional pledges.  Rather, just as with our economic projections, these policy projections reflect the information available at the time of the forecast and are subject to future revision in light of evolving economic and financial conditions.   In the chart labeled “Appropriate Timing of Policy Firming,” each shaded bar indicates the number of Committee participants who judge that the initial increase in the target federal funds rate would appropriately occur in the specified calendar year shown below the bar.  Six participants anticipate that policy firming is likely to commence in 2015 or 2016, while five others expect policy firming to commence in 2014.  The remaining six participants judge that policy liftoff would be appropriate in 2012 or 2013.   More detail is provided by the chart labeled “Appropriate Pace of Policy Firming.”  In that chart, the dots depict the distribution of participants’ assessments regarding the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate at the end of each of the next several years and over the longer run.  For example, based on current information, 11 participants expect that the 6 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  appropriate federal funds rate at the end of 2014 will be at or below 1 percent, while 6 participants anticipate higher rates at that time.  In effect, those judgments are reflected in today’s meeting statement, in which the Committee indicated that economic conditions “are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.”   As I have noted, we are also proceeding with the program that we announced in fostering more accommodative financial conditions without changing the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  The Committee regularly reviews the size and composition of our securities holdings, and we will adjust those holdings as appropriate.  In particular, the Committee recognizes the hardships imposed by high and persistent unemployment and an underperforming economy, and it is prepared to provide further monetary accommodation if employment is not making sufficient progress toward our assessments of its maximum level or if inflation shows signs of moving further below its mandate-consistent rate.  Thank you for your patience.  I’ll be happy to take your questions.   

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, we’ve had several months of economic data that’s been stronger than most forecasters expected—employment was over 200,000, the unemployment rate’s come down to 8½ percent—but there seems to be very little mention of this recent strength in the statement.  Do you and the Committee, Mr. Chairman, harbor doubts about the recent strength in the economy?  And are you and the Committee baking in additional quantitative easing in order to achieve the growth rates that you’ve even forecast here?  Thank you.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Steve, there’s certainly been some encouraging news recently.  We’ve seen slightly better performance in the labor market, consumer sentiment has 7 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  improved, industrial production has been relatively strong—so there are some positive signs, no doubt.  At the same time, we’ve had mixed results in some other areas, such as retail sales, and we continue to see headwinds emanating from Europe, coming from the slowing global economy and some other factors as well.  So, you know, we are obviously hoping that the strength we saw in the fourth quarter and in recent data will continue into 2012, but we’re going to continue to monitor that situation.  I don’t think we’re ready to declare that we’ve entered a new, stronger phase at this point; we’ll continue to look at the data.  We will, as I’ve said in my statement, and as we have in fact in the FOMC statement, you know, we continue to review our holdings—our portfolio holdings, securities, and we are prepared to take further steps in that direction if we see that the recovery’s faltering or if inflation is not moving toward target.  So that’s something—that’s an option that’s certainly on the table.  I think it would be premature to say definitively one way or the other, but we continue to look at that option, and if conditions warrant, we will certainly consider using it.   

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Thank you.  I’m a little confused by these forecasts.  I was hoping you could sort of help me understand what we’re looking at.  It seems to say that you expect that at the end of 2014, unemployment will be at or above 7 percent, inflation will be at or below 2 percent—and yet 11 of the 17 members of your Committee think that will be a good moment to start raising interest rates again.  If unemployment and inflation are in fact symmetric objectives for the Fed, how can that possibly be the case?  And is there any tolerance for above-trend inflation in the service of catch-up growth?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, let me first observe that we have in fact, of course, been very accommodative in the last couple of years.  We’ve kept interest rates close to zero, we’ve done two rounds of asset purchases, we have announced—today, in fact—an extension of 8 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  the period over which we expect to see rates very low, and our maturity extension program is still ongoing, so we maintain a quite accommodative path of policy at this point.  I would further say that I think it’s important to emphasize that we’re not going to mechanically take the interest rate projections that participants provide and just build policy off of that.  I mean, it’s still going to be necessary for the Committee to exercise collective judgment, to consider the costs and risks of additional policy actions, to discuss the uncertainty about the forecast and other factors that come into the policy decision.  Now, all that being said, if inflation is going to remain below target for an extended period, and unemployment progress is very slow, then I think your implicit question is right, there is a case for additional policy action, and we’ll—you know, we want to continue to observe the situation, but we’re certainly prepared to look for different ways to provide support to the economy if, in fact, we have this unsatisfactory situation.   

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Hi, Mr. Chairman, Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.  Congrats on the inflation target, or goal—that’s a big achievement for you, I’m sure.  I’d like to ask if you could explain a little bit the way you think inflation is now working in the economy.  The 2012 central tendency is kind of low, and along with that question, I’d like to know where you think full employment is in the near term, like the next year or two, given the structural impediments that many Fed officials have been talking about.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, there are a number of factors that make us expect inflation to be quite low in the next couple of years.  Certainly, we are seeing a reversal, or at least a flattening out, of the commodity price increases that caused headline inflation to rise earlier in 2011.  And the futures markets, and our own estimates of supply and demand globally with the slowing global economy, suggest that most likely—although, of course, there’s a lot of uncertainty—that commodity prices will remain well controlled over the next couple of years.  9 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  On top of that, of course, we have a very high rate of unemployment; pressure on wages is quite restrained.  And putting that together with strong productivity gains, the costs of production—unit labor costs—are growing very slowly.  Expectations of inflation seem well anchored and, in fact, have been on the low side relative to recent history in recent months.  So for all those reasons, inflation looks to be at or modestly below the 2 percent target going forward.  With respect to the maximum employment measure, we provided a—we have been providing, in fact, for four years, as long as we’ve been providing the economic projections—an estimate of the long-run sustainable rate of unemployment, which is currently—the central tendency is currently 5.2 to 6 percent.  That is higher than it was a couple of years ago, reflecting structural impediments and other changes.  We’re concerned that the large amount of long-term unemployment may be causing some workers to lose skills or lose labor force attachment, which, at least for a while, will also likely increase the so-called natural rate, or sustainable rate, of unemployment.  So there are a number of factors working in that direction.  But in any case, while there’s certainly a lot of uncertainty about exactly where the natural rate of unemployment is, clearly, at 8½ percent, I think we’re comfortably above anybody’s estimate, and for that reason, we still consider the labor market to be obviously quite slack.   

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  Thank you.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Mr. Chairman, how much confidence do you have in the FOMC’s ability to forecast the economy and inflation out three years?  And consequently, how much confidence do you have in the interest rate projections that the Fed has made public today, particularly the ones that go out to 2014 and beyond?  And if I may add a follow-up to that, there seems to be an asymmetry in these dots in that there’s a view that the view that matters the most to the Fed is the view of the 10 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  Chairman.  So when we look at these projections, are we really seeing the most likely expected path of interest rates because the Chairman’s view isn’t represented exclusively here?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, your first question—our ability to forecast three and four years out is obviously very limited, there’s no question about that.  Nevertheless, we have to make a best guess, a provisional plan, in the same way that a firm making an investment has to make a best guess or provisional plan about where the economy and the industry is going to be over a number of years.  And so it’s certainly possible that we will be either too optimistic or too pessimistic, in which case we’ll have to adjust both our forecasts and our policy expectations.  That being said, you know, currently, the zero lower bound on policy rates—at least according to many estimates—is still binding; that is, even if the economy were a bit stronger, the very low interest rates we currently have would still be valid, still be appropriate.  And so for that reason, unless there’s a substantial strengthening of the economy in the near term, I would think that it’s a pretty good guess that we will be keeping rates low for some time from now.  We don’t identify the specific individuals who provide the projections.  Among other reasons, we want to make sure that people come to the meeting willing to talk and not be wedded to a specific position, and that’s why, again, the Committee makes a collective decision after using as input these projections, which are circulated to all the members of the Committee before the meeting so that they can see what their colleagues believe.  As far as what individual members do believe, we certainly have other vehicles for expressing our views.  All of us give speeches, all of us give interviews and are—you know, I give frequent testimony, so there are plenty of opportunities to get a sense of what individual members believe.  But again, we felt that this information, which presents both the diversity of views in the Committee but also shows where the central tendencies lie, would be useful.  And I guess I might add to that, you know, the 11 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  Chairman’s term is not infinite and at some point there’ll be a new Chairman, but there’s a lot more continuity on the FOMC collectively.  The average Bank president is on the FOMC for as much as 10 years and Governors’ terms are 14 years.  So even as the Chairman changes, much of the FOMC remains continuous.  So, as we talk about interest rates in 2014, the fact that there is quite wide-ranging agreement that interest rates will be low for a long time, should give you more confidence that that’s not dependent on a single individual.   

[SECTION]

GREG IP.  Greg Ip of the Economist.  Mr. Chairman, the Fed’s statutory goals are price stability and maximum employment, but traditionally the Fed has interpreted that somewhat flexibly in the sense that if there was a conflict between the two, they would push for price stability rather than for full employment on the view that over time, stable prices was the best contribution monetary policy could make to maximum employment.  But today you went to some pains to say that, actually, you treat these goals—put them on an equal footing, and that there might be circumstances in which you put one above the other.  So following up a little bit on Binyamin’s question, do I take it that if inflation were to move somewhat above your 2 percent preferred level, that you would tolerate that in order to make further progress on unemployment?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the period of time, yes, we treat them symmetrically.  We cannot control, of course, where inflation and unemployment are at each moment in time, and so there will be periods when, for reasons outside of our control, inflation and unemployment will move away from their desired levels.  If—In those situations, the speed at which—I think “tolerate” might be too strong of a word, because we always want to get everything, both sides of the mandate, back to their desired levels—but the speed at which we would enforce that return would depend on what’s happening with the other variable.  So, for 12 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  example, if inflation did go above target by a modest amount, we would certainly try to get it back down to target, but if unemployment were very high, that would lead us to be more cautious and slower in returning to target.  So that’s why “medium term”—which is, these targets are all medium term—is a flexible concept, and it depends on the initial conditions, how far away the two key variables are from their objectives at the beginning of the process.   

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Greg Robb, MarketWatch.  Mr. Chairman, thank you.  You haven’t had a very good time in all the Republican presidential debates, and I was wondering if I could have your comment on what you’ve heard.  And some of the analysts I talked to said that one of the reasons for this hostility, perhaps, is that a lot of the Republican primary voters are on fixed incomes and have an inability to invest and make money with their funds.  So could you talk to them as well?  And one more thing, if Republicans take back the White House in November and ask you to resign, would you?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So I’m not going to get involved in political rhetoric.  I’m just going to stay completely away from that.  I have a job to do, and as long as I’m here, I will do everything I can to help the Federal Reserve achieve its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.  That’s my answer to the last part as well.  I’m not going to be thinking about hypothetical situations in the future.  In the case of savers, you know, we think about all these issues, and we certainly recognize that the low interest rates that we’re using to try to stimulate investment and expansion of the economy also impose a cost on savers who have a lower return.  And we do hear about that, obviously, and we do think about that.  I guess the response I would make is that the savers in our economy are dependent on a healthy economy in order to get adequate returns.  In particular, people own stocks and corporate bonds and other securities as well as, say, Treasury securities, and if our economy is in really bad shape, then 13 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  they are not going to get good returns on those investments.  So I think what we need to do, as is often the case when the economy goes into a very weak situation, then low interest rates are needed to help restore the economy to something closer to full employment and to increase growth and that, in turn, will lead ultimately to higher returns across all assets for savers and investors.  So that’s—I think that’s how we would explain it.  But again, you know, we recognize that during periods like this, savers are getting a lower return.  One reason why it’s extremely important for us to maintain price stability, of course, is that at least that minimizes any losses due to inflation that savers might suffer.   

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Hi, Chairman.  Donna Borak of American Banker.  Shifting a little bit, I’d like to take a look back to the rules that the Fed released back in late December.  Obviously, it was a mammoth task for Fed staff to put forth, and considered the heart of  Dodd–Frank.  There were certain provisions that were left out, including the liquidity requirements, due largely to the fact that there’s global consensus needed on those rules in the Basel III process.  But I was hoping you could expand a little bit more on the decision for Fed staff to forgo specifying what the additional capital requirements would be for those banks that were not necessarily deemed GSIBs, at least now, but were still above the $50 billion threshold, and to talk a little bit about what the core issues are in deciding whether or not that additional capital should come in the form of a surcharge, what that surcharge might look like, and when we might know.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, you’re referring, I think, to the 165–166 rules, which will focus on the supervisory oversight of the largest banks.  It’s a very big and complicated rule, as everyone knows, and so our position at this time is that we would still like to get feedback from the industry and from the public about what the best approach is.  So we put out a lot of 14 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  questions, and we’ll be considering those during the comment period and after, as we put together a rule.  The notion of the surcharges is that banks which do not pose significant threats to the systemic stability of Unites States, you know, should not have a significant surcharge.  We’re required to consider these issues by Dodd–Frank, but our view is that it’s the largest banks, the ones whose failure would endanger our financial system, that should be subject to these surcharges because, first—because we need to have them be safer than smaller banks, and secondly, because we want to try to equalize the cost of credit that they face.  In other words, a bank which is thought to be too big to fail gets an artificial subsidy in the interest rate that it can borrow at, and by having additional capital requirements, that tends to equalize the cost of funding to different banks and reduces the incentive of banks to get large just to create the impression of being too big to fail.  So we think those are important and we will continue to work with them.  The Basel Committee has provided some sense of the range of what those surcharges will fall into, and so we’re still working on defining exactly the criteria, but you can assume that it will be a fairly continuous range between the $50 billion banks and the very largest banks in our economy.  As I said, we’re getting reactions and comments.  We hope to get—you know, early this year—we hope to come back with a clarification on the rule, and of course, we’re also working hard on implementing Basel III itself, which we want to do during 2012—we want to put out the rule during 2012.   three years now, the Fed has conducted policy through extraordinary means, and yet the new information that we have today pertains mostly to an eventual tightening of policy through raising interest rates.  Why is there no new information about the size of the Fed’s balance sheet, 15 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  and what should anybody looking at your communications today deduce about an eventual expansion of the balance sheet through more asset purchases?

So we will be providing, in our minutes and in our Survey of Economic Projections, which will be released in three weeks—we’ll be providing some additional qualitative information about peoples’—participants’ views of the balance sheet going forward.  The reason that I can’t provide all that information now is basically that we received, you know, a whole range of qualitative comments, and we had further discussion during the meeting yesterday and today, and so, you know, we’re going to need a little time to summarize that and to have it approved by, you know—the minutes, of course, and the SEP are approved by the entire Committee—and so, in that respect, it will be a definitive statement about what we currently know about the balance sheet.  I can say a few things.  You know, one is that it certainly remains—expanding the balance sheet certainly remains an option, one that we would consider very seriously if—in particular, if progress toward full employment was continued, or it became more, inadequate, or if inflation remained exceptionally low.  So we’ll continue to look at that.  As we say in our statement, we’re prepared to take additional measures in general, and that would be certainly one class of measures we would want to consider.  I can make one additional point, which maybe wasn’t obvious, which is that, in June, we provided some principles relating the sales of assets—ultimate sales of assets—to the path of interest rates, and those remain—those principles remain in force.  And so one implication of our extension of our expected point of takeoff to late 2014 is to imply that the initial sales from our balance sheet, which again are far down the road but—that begins—that will be later than previously thought.  That will be presumably in 2015.  So we do expect to hold our balance sheet at a high level for a longer period.  Additional sales again—I’m sorry—Additional purchases remains a topic that we 16 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  are still debating, and it will depend both on our assessment of the efficacy and the risks of that particular tool, but also of how the economy is evolving.

ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times.  Mr. Chairman, when I look at these forecasts for 2014, the median of the forecast is, I think, 0.75 and the mean is 1.12 percent.  If I were to draw a line through this—these dots, how should I draw it so I best understand what the FOMC is most likely to do?  And the second part—in the minutes, you say that the Committee will consider further options for improvements to the SEP, the economic projections.  Could you tell us a bit more about what further you might do?  Thank you.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, first I want to emphasize that there is no mechanical relationship between these projections and the outcomes of the FOMC decisions.  Of course, they’re a big input into those decisions, but it’s a collective decision.  If you want to draw lines, I guess I would—I guess my suggestion would be to look at the median, the middle of the distribution, because we do have a democratic process in the Committee, and so the median would give you some sense of where the weight balances against higher—in favor of higher or lower rates.  Again, we did note that in support of our assessment of late 2014, which is a Committee decision, and of course there was a 9-to-1 vote in favor of that, but that is supported by the observation that 11 of the 17 participants expect the funds rate at the end of 2014 to be 1 percent or less, and so presumably the takeoff would not be much earlier than that.  In terms of future additions, there are a lot of ways we could go.  We could provide, for example, more relationships between—more information about the relationship between individuals’ policy preferences and their forecasts, and so on.  But there’s nothing specific now that has been analysis of possible ways of improving our transparency.  So we will be looking at additional 17 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  possibilities, and we would welcome feedback for that matter.  But there’s nothing specific planned at this point.   

[SECTION]

DEREK KRAVITZ.  Derek Kravitz, Associated Press.  Last night the President unveiled a plan to revamp and expand the government’s refinancing program.  Essentially, the Fed released a white paper earlier this month that said that up to 2½ million homeowners could benefit from this, essentially save $3,000 per year in mortgage payments.  Right now there’s a mortgage settlement being brokered between state attorneys general and the nation’s major mortgage lenders, something to the tune of $25 billion, much of which would be in the form of principal reduction.  In the white paper that was released earlier this month, the Fed seemed to indicate that principal reduction could be helpful, but it was unclear about whether they thought that this was an acceptable or even feasible option.  They also made clear that a lot of the proposals that are currently out there “eat around the edges,” so to speak, when you’re dealing with a foreclosure crisis, and a lot of economists agree.  Do you think a principal reduction in the form of the major mortgage settlement would do a lot to help the housing crisis?  And if not, is there any other alternative proposal that would help?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the Federal Reserve obviously has a very strong interest in the housing sector.  The weakness of the housing sector is an important reason why the economy is not recovering more robustly, and the problems in housing finance are part of the reason why monetary policy has not been more powerful—because part of our transmission mechanism is through lower interest rates, which affects refinancing; it affects sales and purchases as well.  So, in addition to that, as bank supervisors, we have considerable interest in servicing, in loan modifications, in delinquencies, and all the aspects of mortgage lending.  So we have a considerable interest in this area, and as you say, we did a white paper, which looked 18 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  at a number of issues, including refinancing and mortgage finance.  I think it’s important to say that our intent in that white paper was to provide the benefit of our analysis to the public and to those who will be making policy.  We did not take specific stands on individual issues.  What we tried to do was provide the pros and the cons and provide some context for these debates.  So we did discuss refinancing, we did discuss principal forgiveness.  I would say that there’s a variety of views about principal forgiveness within the Federal Reserve System, and there is no official position.  There—It seems very likely that principal forgiveness could be helpful, depending on how it’s structured, in reducing delinquencies.  There are also some potential drawbacks; one of them is the fact that the amount of negative equity in the United States is about $700 billion, which is enormous, and so there is no conceivable program that is going to put everybody in the country above water.  And so I think the issue then becomes, if we have $20 or $25 billion or whatever the number may end up being in this settlement, you know, what is the most cost-effective way to help as many people as possible?  And I think that’s an ongoing debate.  But with respect to principal reduction, you know, I’ve spoken about this in the past, and it certainly has some advantages; a lot depends on how it’s structured, and a lot depends on what the alternatives are that you’re considering.   

[SECTION]

PETER BARNES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Peter Barnes of FOX Business.  One of the goals of the Fed and the release of all these new materials, the forecast, and the policy announcement are to help to create expectations and set expectations.  But are you concerned at all that this—that the materials and the forecasts and the policy announcement path today might help create negative expectations?  In other words, the average American’s takeaway of your announcement to keep interest rates low—exceptionally low, through 2014 now, might signal to them that maybe the Fed thinks that the economy is in much worse shape than we all thought, 19 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  and that, in turn, could affect consumer confidence, consumer spending, and the ability to create a self-sustaining economic recovery at some point.  Is there a risk of this?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, whenever the Fed takes a policy action, there’s always some potential for a signal.  I mean, that’s true not just in these current times, but anytime the Fed lowers or increases interest rates, and that’s something we have to think about.  But I think, generally speaking, that those considerations are outweighed by the need to maintain accommodative financial conditions so that it’s attractive to firms to invest and hire, attractive for those who are eligible to buy homes, and so on, and I think that that ultimately is more powerful than the signal from the change in policy.  In particular, the markets and the news media are very good at picking up the underlying economic data and making assessments of the state of the economy and reporting what different people think about the economy, so I wouldn’t overstate the Fed’s ability to massively change expectations through its statements, for example.  So, again, I think that while we certainly take that into account, we think it’s important for us to say what we think, and we think it’s important for us to provide the right amount of stimulus to try to help our economy recover from its currently underutilized condition.   

[SECTION]

DARREN GERSH.  Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report.  Let me kind of follow up on Peter’s question.  Why shouldn’t somebody looking at these numbers from the outside say “Look, as aggressive as you say you’ve been, and as aggressive as you have been, it doesn’t look like you’re meeting any of your goals for the next three years on the economy, so why isn’t the Fed doing more now?”  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, as I said earlier, the Fed has been doing a great deal.  Just since August we have put a date on our expected period of low interest rates.  We undertook the maturity extension program, which is still continuing.  Today we announced a 20 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  further extension of the expected period of low rates.  By issuing this expected policy rate information, we hope to convey to the market the extent to which there is support on the Committee for maintaining rates at a low level for a significant time.  So, you know, I don’t accept the premise that we’ve been passive; we’ve been actually quite active in our policy, and in one respect, the low level of inflation is a validation in the following sense, that there were some who were very concerned that our balance sheet policies and the like would lead to high inflation.  There’s certainly no sign of that yet, and it hasn’t shown up either in financial markets or in outside forecasters’ expectations.  Now that being said, as I mentioned earlier, if the situation continues, with inflation below target and unemployment declining at a rate which is very, very slow, then more—our framework, the logic of our framework, says we should be looking for ways to do more.  It’s not completely straightforward because, of course, we’re now dealing with a variety of nonstandard policy tools—we can’t just lower the federal funds rate 25 basis points like in the good old days—but your basic point is right, that, you know, we need to adopt policies that will both achieve our inflation objectives and help the economy recover as quickly as is feasible.  And, I would say that your question—actually, an earlier question—shows a benefit of explaining this framework because the framework makes very clear that we need to be thinking about ways in which we can provide further stimulus if we don’t get some improvement in the pace of recovery and a normalization of inflation.   

[SECTION]

PATRICK WELTER.  Mr. Chairman, Patrick Welter from the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.  I have two short questions.  Your predecessor, Mr. Greenspan, once said about his personal inflation—long-term inflation goal that it would be 0 percent if appropriately measured.  And I would like you to compare the inflation goal you told us about today with that statement.  And, the second question is, Comparing what you did today, are you approaching more some 21 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  kind of inflation targeters like the central bank of Sweden or Norway, or are you approaching more the European Central Bank, for example, which has some kind of inflation goal but is not really an inflation targeter?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Excellent questions.  So, a literal reading of price stability would say inflation should be at zero.  Now, there are some technical reasons why that may not be true.  There are probably some measurement biases and other issues that mean that a measured value of inflation above zero is probably consistent with stable prices.  But as we’ve talked about frequently, we set inflation—our inflation objective in a way that was consistent with both sides of the mandate:  price stability—and 2 percent is low enough that we believe that it’s not going to extensively interfere with financial planning and economic planning on the part of households and businesses—but also in the interest of employment.   A target for inflation that was zero would have several consequences.  First, we would be spending maybe half of our time, or at least a significant amount of our time, in a deflationary zone.  And we’ve seen in many instances that deflation can be bad for economic performance and bad for employment, and, therefore, setting an inflation target at zero would be not consistent with the other part of our mandate.  Incidentally, related to that, a zero inflation rate would mean that nominal interest rates would be at very low levels, typically 2 to 3 percent or whatever they might be, and that would increase the risk and probability that we would be in a situation like today where we really can’t cut the short-term interest rate any further.  So I think there are good reasons from a dual-mandate perspective to have inflation greater than 2 percent.  And I would add that, you know, if you look at central banks around the world, whether they are nominal inflation targeters or not, that 2 percent is basically the number that most central banks 22 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  use; the ECB, many other central banks either use 2 percent or a range around 2 percent.  So this is not at all different from what many other central banks do.   Now, are we inflation targeters?  If by “inflation targeter” you mean a central bank that puts top priority on inflation and other goals, like employment, as subsidiary goals, then the answer is no.  We are a dual-mandate central bank:  We put equal weight on price stability and maximum employment; those are the goals given to us by the Congress.  And so, in that respect, as I mentioned earlier, I think, to Greg, we’re not absolutists:  If there’s a need to let inflation return a little bit more slowly to target in order to get a better result in employment, then that’s something that we would be willing to do.  Having said all that, I think it’s worth noting that even banks that—central banks that call themselves inflation targeters typically pay at least some attention to other parts of the economy:  employment, growth, financial stability, and the like.  So I don’t think there’s really any central bank, or very few, at least, that focus only on inflation.  But again, in terms of terminology, I guess I would reject that term for the Federal Reserve because we are going to be evenhanded in treating the price stability and maximum employment parts of our mandate on a level footing.   

[SECTION]

ZACHARY GOLDFARB.  Thank you.  Zach Goldfarb from the Washington Post.  Two questions.  First, can you clarify whether if actual economic conditions match their projections, that’s an acceptable future course, or that would require additional easing?  And secondly, in the past, a number of times you said that even when interest rates are at the zero bound, the Fed can still have a significant impact on influencing economic growth; do you still believe that the Fed has the capacity to deploy tools that would have a significant impact on bringing down unemployment at a faster pace than we see in these projections if it chose to do so?  23 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  On the first question, I, you know—as was pointed out by  FINAL  Steve, for example—we’ve had some good data recently.  I think there’s some uncertainty about where the economy is going, and we want to continue to observe how the economy is developing.   But I would say that, as I’ve said on several—in several answers, that if recovery continues to be modest and progress on unemployment very slow, and if inflation appears to be likely to be below target for a number of years out—so the configuration we’re talking about in the projections—then I think there would be a very strong case, based on our framework, for finding a different—additional tools for expansionary policies or to support the economy.  So we’ll continue to look at the different options and try to decide what might be most effective.   We are in a difficult situation in terms of the effectiveness of policy tools.  My own view, thinking about the effects, for example, of additional purchases—additional securities purchases, I’ve been pretty satisfied in the sense that—in the following sense, that purchases do seem to have the desired effects on financial conditions:  They tend to ease financial conditions, they tend to lower interest rates, they tend to strengthen asset prices.  And those are exactly the kinds of things that monetary policy normally does in order to try to provide stableness to the economy.  What has been a bit more uncertain is the effectiveness of the transmission mechanism.  And we have seen some developments in the economy that have probably weakened the effectiveness of policy, including, notably, the housing sector, where one would expect—with mortgage rates below 4 percent, one would expect to see more activity than we’ve been seeing.  And the problems in housing finance and so on are part of the reason that the expansionary stimulus is not feeding through as much as we would like to the real economy.  I would not say, though, that our policies are—that we’re out of ammunition.  No, I think we still have tools, but we need to 24 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  further analyze and study those tools and try to make comparisons in terms of effectiveness, risks, and the like.  So I think we still have a process to figure out what is the most effective approach.  Does that—yeah, okay.   

[SECTION]

STEVE BECKNER.  Steve Beckner, Market News International, Mr. Chairman, with a question about the new forward guidance language in the statement itself.  And Peter anticipated one of my questions about the potential danger of it sending a negative signal, but let me ask, What was the rationale for continuing to have forward guidance phraseology instead of just letting these forecasts, these new forecasts of the funds rates, speak for themselves?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, that’s a very good question.  I might have commented on Zach’s question that our two main tools at this point—given that short-term interest rates are close to zero—are asset purchases, but the other is communications.  And to the extent that we can communicate that rates will be lower for longer, that will ease financial conditions and be a way that we can affect the state of the economy.  And that’s part of the reason—other than just a general desire for transparency—that we brought out some of these ideas at this point.  The reason that we just don’t release the economic projections and leave it at that is because, while the economic projections of future policy rates are an important input to our policy discussions around the table, the decision ultimately is made by the Federal Open Market Committee, you know, which is the voters sitting around the table, and in a process by which we exchange ideas and make arguments and come to a collective determination.  So, you know, we don’t set the federal funds interest rate by having members send in their vote and not having a meeting; we have a meeting for a reason, which is to talk to each other and try to come to some kind of consensus.  So the FOMC will always, in some sense, trump the projections of forward interest 25 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  rates, but clearly, because the participants and the people around the table are the same, the projections should give significant information about where the FOMC is likely to go.   

[SECTION]

HUGUES HONORÉ.  Hugues Honoré with Agence France-Presse.  The FOMC stated that global growth has slowed and, of course, that is weighing on financial conditions in the U.S.  Arguably, one way that the Federal Reserve could help would be by extending a loan to the International Monetary Fund.  There have been other central banks that have been doing that when the government was reluctant to do so, and we have all noted that the Fed was not shy when it came to extending loans to international financial institutions, private banks, and so on that are based or that have subsidiaries in the U.S.  Is it something that you could consider if the sovereign debt crisis got worse?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, lending to financial institutions is part of our mandated function; it’s part of our raison d’être to provide a lender of last resort in the case of a panic, as we’ve done in the recent crisis.  Committing funds to the IMF I don’t think is within the purview of the Federal Reserve.  That’s a decision that’s made in the first instance by the Treasury and the Administration and in the second instance via approval through the Congress.  So I think the appropriate deciders in that case would be the Administration and the Congress, not the Federal Reserve.   

[SECTION]

SCOTT SPOERRY.  Scott Spoerry, sir, from CNN.  My head’s full of questions, but I’m going to try and limit it to two related questions.  You’re linking your inflation target of 2 percent to the PCE.  The PCE is something that hundreds of millions of Americans have no idea what it is; they do know what the CPI is.  Can you explain, in layman’s terms, something that regular folks might understand, why they should not worry too much when inflation by the—if the CPI is different than the PCE?  And the second question is related also to inflation 26 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  and to the targeting because the Fed’s always been a little bit vague in terms of what sort of inflation it would accept, and this is a marked change.  Because criticism of the Federal Reserve—criticism of you, but the institution itself has been so intense this year because it’s a political year—there are people out there who are going to say “The Federal Reserve has finally just admitted it.  Their policy is to destroy 2 percent of the value of my dollars every year.”  How are you going to respond to those people?  And also, could you answer the question about the CPI and the PCE?  Thank you.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.  Well, we chose the PCE index for some, I think, very valid technical reasons.  It better allows—better accounts for changes in people’s purchasing patterns; you know, when some things become more expensive, people will tend to move to other types of goods and services.  That’s not accounted for by the CPI, which has fixed weights.  It also—the PCE—I think more relevant to the average person, the PCE includes all health-care costs, not just out-of-pocket costs, and that has two benefits.  One is, it reduces the share of the inflation index which is tied to housing.  And the CPI has a very large share devoted to housing, and a large share of that part of the index is imputed—that is, essentially made-up numbers.  So that’s one benefit, to keep the—you know, not to put too much weight on the imputed housing numbers, which is part of the CPI.  The other is that, even if people are not paying for health care immediately out-of-pocket, they do pay for it, either through taxes or through reduced wages as, you know, increased health-care costs raise insurance premiums for employers.  So I think this is probably a better measure of the inflation that’s faced by typical consumers than the CPI is.  That being said, these various measures—the CPI and others, PCE index and others—move very closely together, and you’re not going to have a situation where the CPI is 10 percent and the PCE is 2 percent.  There may be a few tenths difference, but, generally speaking, they move very 27 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference   FINAL  closely together.  So, in that respect, I think if people look at the CPI, they should feel pretty comfortable that, you know, that’s going to be very close to where the PCE inflation is. On the 2 percent, again, that’s where the United States has been for many years.  That’s where most central banks are around the world.  There’s a very good reason for it, which is to avoid deflation, which is very negative.  I think the argument that, you know, the value of your dollar declines at 2 percent a year is just not really a very good one, unless you’re one of those people who does their lifetime saving in the mattress.  Most people invest in various kinds of instruments, receiving a rate of interest.  And now, it’s true, as has been pointed out, that for the moment interest rates are pretty low, but they’re still positive.  But over a longer period of time, if you—even if you have money in a CD or some other investment vehicle, the interest rate will compensate you for inflation.  I mean, the two will be tied together.  And so there really shouldn’t be, you know—at levels of inflation this low, interest rates should pretty much fully compensate for the losses to savers.  But I would reiterate that we are not unaware of the problems that low interest rates cause for savers, cause for pension fund contributions, insurance companies, and other parts of the economy, and we do try to take that into account as we think about other ramifications of our policy.   

[SECTION]

PETER COOK.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Peter Cook of Bloomberg Television.  Two questions, if I could, separate from your role here as Fed Chairman.  Two issues in Congress right now, on which your advice might be worthwhile.  The payroll tax cut is coming up for debate again, this debate about whether to extend it for a full year.  What is your assessment right now of the impact that would have on the U.S. economy if it was not extended?  And likewise, what if the Congress were to not implement the 1.2 on automatic spending cuts imposed by the failure of the supercommittee—what impact would that have on the U.S. economy?   28 of 29 January 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as you know, the Federal Reserve makes it a policy to  try to avoid commenting on specific individual tax and spending programs, and I don’t have those numbers at hand in any case.  But what I would say is the following—is that what I’ve tried to convey to Congress, and I think many other economists have taken the same view, is that responsible fiscal policy has at least two components at this point.  One is, of course, importantly, to achieve fiscal sustainability.  And to achieve fiscal sustainability over a long period of time, we need to be acting soon—now would be preferable—to making credible commitments to reducing spending, to improving our programs, to modifying or simplifying our tax code, and so on, so as the ways that will be persuasive to the markets or to the public that over the longer term, over the next 10, 20, 30 years, that our fiscal position will be sustainable.  So that’s an important thing to do.  It relates to the second part of your question.  I think it’s important to take steps at least to—again, the specific steps are up to Congress, but it’s important that action be taken to provide a credible plan to achieve fiscal sustainability.   The second part of my recommendation, though, is that we need at this juncture to be sensitive to the effects of whatever policy decisions are made on what is still a very fragile recovery.  Again, there are many ways to do that, but I think that should be taken into account as people are looking at policy alternatives in terms of taxes or spending.   Thank you.   29 of 29",Ben Bernanke,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
4,2012-04-25,"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon.  Before we get to questions, I’ll summarize today’s policy action by the Federal Open Market Committee and then I’ll place the Committee’s policy decision in the context of our economic outlook and our collective judgment regarding the appropriate path of monetary policy.   As indicated in the statement released earlier this afternoon, the Committee is maintaining the highly accommodative policies that we initiated at previous meetings.  We anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.  Our program to extend the average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s security holdings—announced in September—will continue as scheduled.  Each of these policy actions is intended to foster accommodative financial conditions that support the economic recovery in a context of price stability.   In conjunction with today’s meeting, FOMC participants—the 5 Board members and the 12 Reserve Bank presidents—submitted their individual economic projections and policy assessments for the years 2012 to 2014 and over the long run.  These projections serve as important inputs into the Committee’s deliberations.   Incoming information suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately.  Most Committee participants expect economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up gradually.  Among other factors, and not withstanding some signs of improvement, the ongoing weakness of the housing sector still represents a headwind for recovery.  Strains in global financial markets, though less pronounced, generally, than last fall, continue to pose significant risks to the outlook.    1 of 23 April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL   Labor market conditions have improved in recent months, with the unemployment rate having fallen nearly a percentage point since August.  However, at 8.2 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Looking ahead, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually over the next several years, reflecting the moderate pace of economic growth.  Specifically, participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency of 7.8 to 8.0 percent, declining to 6.7 to 7.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014.  For comparison, participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment have a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.   Inflation has picked up somewhat, mainly reflecting higher gasoline prices.  However, as has been the case for other recent swings in oil prices, the Committee expects that effect to be only temporary.  Moreover, survey measures and financial market indicators continue to show stability in longer-term inflation expectations.  Consequently, we anticipate that inflation will subsequently run at or below the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent.  In particular, participants’ projections of inflation have a central tendency of 1.9 to 2.0 percent for 2012 and 1.7 to 2.0 percent for 2014.   The economic projections submitted by FOMC participants are conditioned on their individual assessments of the appropriate path of monetary policy.  As you can see from the chart labeled “Appropriate Timing of Policy Firming,” Committee participants have a range of views about when the initial increase in the federal funds rate is likely to be appropriate.  Following a careful discussion of those views at today’s meeting, the FOMC maintained its collective judgment that economic conditions will likely warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.  In particular, a highly accommodative stance of  2 of 23 April 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  monetary policy is warranted in light of the persistence of the factors restraining the pace of recovery and the ongoing risks to the economic outlook.   Finally, the Committee took no new decisions regarding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet today, but we remain prepared to adjust our securities holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price stability.   Thank you.  I’d be glad to take your questions. 

[SECTION]

DARREN GERSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report.  Some of your critics—I’m sure you’re not going to be surprised—think that you’re still being too cautious, that unemployment is still high, the economy may be slowing, inflation is subdued, and I know you just talked about the balance sheet.  But given that, is the Committee now any closer to QE3 than it was at its last meeting? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, first, the Committee has certainly been bold and aggressive in terms of easing monetary policy.  We’ve maintained the federal funds rate close to zero since late 2008.  We’ve had two rounds of so-called quantitative easing.  We’ve had a maturity extension program, which is ongoing.  We have offered guidance about the federal funds rate that goes into at least late 2014.   So we have been very accommodative, and we remain prepared to do more as needed to make sure that this recovery continues and that inflation stays close to target.  So, in particular, we will continue to assess, you know, looking at the economic outlook, looking at the risks, whether or not unemployment is making sufficient progress towards its longer-run normal level, and whether inflation is remaining close to target.  And, if appropriate, and depending also on assessment of the costs and risks of additional policy actions, we remain entirely prepared to take additional balance sheet actions if necessary to achieve our objectives.  So those tools remain  3 of 23 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  very much on the table, and we will not hesitate to use them should the economy require that  additional support. 

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  Mr. Chairman, Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  The Fed has been forecasting for some time that inflation would fall to 2 percent or below.  The latest measures of inflation suggest that the core PCE is at the higher end of that range and many other measures are above 2 percent.  I noticed that in your forecast today that the upper end of your forecasts all the way through 2014 have increased.  Do you see a risk that the disinflationary forces in the economy might not be as strong as the Fed had been projecting for some time? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I would just say, first, that our projections still have inflation very close to our 2 percent target.  As you point out, core inflation and some other measures of underlying inflation have been a little stronger than expected.  But I would say first that some of the movement in the first quarter, for example, seems to have come from transitory sources like nonmarket components.  And the fundamentals of inflation—in particular, inflation expectations; the amount of slack in the economy; the commodity price behavior, which has been relatively well-controlled in recent months—all of those things suggest that inflation is going to stay close to or perhaps a bit below our 2 percent target.  Now, as I mentioned in the opening remarks and as we said in our briefing, the recent rise in gasoline prices has created a temporary bulge in headline inflation, in overall inflation, but we expect that to pass through the system and, assuming no new shocks in the oil sector, inflation ought to moderate to about 2 percent later this year. 

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  Why did the lower bound in those forecasts rise? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The lower bound rose—again, this represents 17 distinct views—but I would guess that the reason is that the data have come in a little bit firmer, core  4 of 23 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  inflation has been a little stronger than was expected.  But those differences are not particularly  large. 

[SECTION]

PEDRO DA COSTA.  Mr. Chairman, Pedro da Costa from Reuters.  So we know that the Committee foresees rates staying very low until late 2014.  What is your personal view on the timing of the first rate hike, on the likely timing?  And second, do you see the Committee as having an easing bias at the moment or is it neutral?  Could it go either way? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I’m very comfortable with the consensus view that we enunciated today, and I think that the Committee broadly is comfortable—a 9-to-1 vote in favor of this guidance.  So again, that represents a very accommodative stance of policy.  Our intention is to maintain a highly accommodative stance of policy for the foreseeable future, and we remain able and willing to take further action if necessary.  At the same time, I think it is worth noting that the forward guidance on the federal funds rate is conditional on the data, and if the data were to come in much stronger than expected, we would adjust the guidance appropriately.  So it’s not unconditional; it does depend on how the outlook evolves.  And again, should the outlook strengthen notably, then we would have to respond to that. 

[SECTION]

PEDRO DA COSTA.  How much more weakness would you need to see for QE3 to be in place?  Would you need to see an actual recession take place? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The question is, you know, “How much more weakness do we need?”  The Committee has to make those assessments, and we’ve been working to try to provide more-explicit guidance, quantitative guidance about our policy reaction function, but so far, you know, we haven’t really done that.  And I can only say qualitatively that the Committee will continue to look at the evolution of the outlook, try to assess whether unemployment is making sufficient progress towards our objectives, and, in particular, whether the recovery is still  5 of 23 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  continuing.  And we remain prepared to use balance sheet tools to support the recovery and to help make sure that unemployment continues its downward path towards longer-run normal  levels. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, according to the latest forecast, 10 members of the FOMC see a 1 percent or higher fed funds rate in 2014; 7 of them see a 2 percent or higher fed funds rate.  Under that—those conditions, how can the guidance in the statement, that you remain exceptionally low through late 2014, be justified?  And is there a point at which the dissonance between the individual forecasts and the guidance get to a point where one or the other is no longer tenable? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, there’s certainly a range of views, as you’ve noted, but these projections are inputs into a Committee process.  And it’s in the Committee meeting that we had yesterday and today where we debate not only the possible outcomes, but also the risks, the uncertainties, all the things that inform our collective judgment.  And as I said, the Committee had no difficulty coming to a consensus that the guidance that we gave is still appropriate.  Again, if there’s a substantial change in the economic outlook in either direction, then the guidance would change appropriately.  But for now, I think the Committee is comfortable with the consensus statement that we put out. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Do you worry about creating confusion in the market between the guidance and the individual forecasts? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, the individual projections are inputs to the Committee decision, so the Committee decision is the critical element in that respect.  We are continuing to work to become more transparent, and we have a variety of things that we’re  6 of 23 April 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  looking at, so you’ll have to stay tuned for that.  But again, the Committee was quite comfortable with the consensus that we have reported today. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Unemployment is too high, and you said you expect it to remain too high for years to come.  Inflation is under control, and you say that you expect it to remain under control.  You say that you have additional tools available for you to use, but you’re not using them right now.  Under these circumstances, it’s really hard for a lot of people to understand why you are not using those tools right now.  Could you address that?  And specifically, could you address whether your current views are inconsistent with the views on that subject that you held as an academic? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yeah.  Let me tackle that second part first.  So there’s this view circulating that the views I expressed about 15 years ago on the Bank of Japan are somehow inconsistent with our current policies.  That is absolutely incorrect.  Our—my views and our policies today are completely consistent with the views that I held at that time.  I made two points at that time to the Bank of Japan.  The first was that I believe that a determined central bank could and should work to eliminate deflation—that is, falling prices.  The second point that I made was that when short-term interest rates hit zero, the tools of a central bank are no longer—are not exhausted, there are still other things that the central bank can do to create additional accommodation.  Now, looking at the current situation in United States, we are not in deflation.  When deflation became a significant risk in late 2010, or at least a modest risk in late 2010, we used additional balance sheet tools to help return inflation close to the 2 percent target.  Likewise, we have been aggressive and creative in using non-federal-funds-rate-centered tools to achieve additional accommodation for the U.S. economy.  So the very critical difference between the Japanese situation 15 years ago and the U.S. situation today is that Japan was in deflation,  7 of 23 April 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  and, clearly, when you’re in deflation and in recession, then both sides of your mandates, so to speak, are demanding additional accommodation.  In this case, it’s—we are not in deflation, we have an inflation rate that’s close to our objective.  Now, why don’t we do more?  Well, first I would again reiterate that we are doing a great deal; policy is extraordinarily accommodative.  We—and I won’t go through the list again, but you know all the things that we have done to try to provide support to the economy.  I guess the question is, does it make sense to actively seek a higher inflation rate in order to achieve a slightly increased reduction—a slightly increased pace of reduction in the unemployment rate?  The view of the Committee is that that would be very reckless.  We have—we, the Federal Reserve, have spent 30 years building up credibility for low and stable inflation, which has proved extremely valuable in that we’ve been be able to take strong accommodative actions in the last four or five years to support the economy without leading to an unanchoring of inflation expectations or a destabilization of inflation.  To risk that asset for what I think would be quite tentative and perhaps doubtful gains on the real side would be, I think, an unwise thing to do. 

[SECTION]

KRISTINA PETERSON.  Thank you.  Given your warnings to lawmakers about the looming fiscal cliff, do you think the Fed has to take into account when Congress chooses to take action?  If they waited ’til January, say, would you feel obligated to take into the—the potential economic blow into account? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think we’ll have to take fiscal policy into account to some extent, but I think it’s very important to say that if no action were to be taken by the fiscal authorities, the size of the fiscal cliff is such that there’s, I think, absolutely no chance that the Federal Reserve could or would have any ability whatsoever to offset that effect on the economy.  So I—as I have said many times before, it’s imperative for Congress to give us a fiscal policy  8 of 23 April 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  that achieves two principal objectives.  The first is, of course, to achieve fiscal sustainability over the longer term; that is critical, and that’s something that needs to be addressed.  At the same time, I think that can be done in a way that doesn’t endanger the short-term recovery of the economy.  And I am concerned that if all the tax increases and spending cuts that are associated with the current law and which would take place—absent any congressional action—were to occur on January 1st, that that would be a significant risk to the recovery.  So I’m looking and hoping that Congress will take actions that will address both sides of that—both requirements of a good fiscal policy. 

[SECTION]

JOSH ZUMBRUN.  Mr. Chairman, Josh Zumbrun from Bloomberg News.  In today’s statement you said, after coming quarters, you expect the economy “to pick up gradually.”  Yet in the forecast that we got today, we see the forecast for 2013 and 2014, the growth forecast, is downgraded.  What caused you to downgrade your forecast for 2013 and 2014 when you see a pickup after the coming quarters? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, these are the views of the participants, the 17 participants.  So the basic feature that is described in our statement, which is that growth seems likely to pick up over time, is still obviously in our projections.  The 2013 numbers are stronger than the 2012 numbers, and the 2014 numbers are stronger than the 2013 numbers.  And the reason for that expected pickup over time is, first, a very accommodative monetary policy, which continues to provide support for the recovery.  But in addition, some of the headwinds that have been affecting our recovery—such as the housing market, financial stresses, credit tightness, and so on—some of those things we hope will be lifting over time and will allow the economy to grow more quickly and approach more quickly its longer-run full employment level.   9 of 23 April 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  The reason—I don’t know precisely why there’s been a slight downgrade in years further out, but I suspect that the fiscal issues may be part of that. 

[SECTION]

ZACH GOLDFARB.  Mr. Chairman, you’ve made the inflation target sound a little bit more like an inflation ceiling, and you suggested that a breaching of that ceiling or target would hurt the Fed’s credibility.  Can you explain a little bit more about why you think going 50 basis points or a full percentage point above the 2 percent target would hurt the Fed’s credibility, and what that would do on the unemployment side if you were to do that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So it’s not a ceiling, it’s a symmetric objective, and we attempt to bring inflation close to 2 percent.  And in particular, if inflation were to jump for whatever reason—and we don’t have, obviously don’t have perfect control of inflation—we’ll try to return inflation to 2 percent at a pace which takes into account the situation with respect to unemployment.  The risk of higher inflation—you say 2½ percent; well, 2½ percent expected change might involve a distribution of outcomes, some of which might be much higher than 2½ percent.  And the concern we have is that if inflation were to run well above 2 percent for a protracted period, that the credibility and the well-anchored inflation expectations, which are such a valuable asset of the Federal Reserve, might become eroded, in which case we would in fact have less rather than more flexibility to use accommodative monetary policy to achieve our employment goals.  I would cite to you, just as an example, if you look at Vice Chair Yellen’s paper, which she gave—or speech, which she gave a couple of weeks ago, where she described a number of ways of looking at the late 2014 guidance.  She showed there some so-called optimal policy rules that come from trying to get the best possible outcomes from our quantitative econometric models, and what you see, if you look at that, is that the best possible outcomes, assuming perfect certainty, assuming perfect foresight—very unrealistic assumptions—still  10 of 23 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  involve inflation staying quite close to 2 percent.  So there is no presumption even in our econometric models that you need inflation well above target in order to make progress on  unemployment. 

[SECTION]

PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes, Fox News, sir.  For those of us who try to make a living out of parsing these statements noted that in the section on strains in global financial markets, the Committee said this time around, “Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.”  But in January, the Committee said that the strains were easing.  What are we to read into this apparent change?  Are strains tightening now?  And what is your assessment of the situation in Europe with the debt crisis—are authorities there adequately addressing the debt crisis?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it’s just supposed to be a factual description of what’s happening in the environment.  In January, the financial markets had calmed considerably, reflecting a number of steps taken in Europe, including, notably, the two large long-term refinancing operations by the European Central Bank, which helped finance Europe’s banks for up to three years.  In recent weeks, we’ve seen more market stress arising from concerns about the fiscal positions of Spain and Italy, and, you know, we’ve seen more volatility in our own that we saw late last year and early this year in European financial markets and in our own financial markets has been reversed recently, nothing more intended than that.  As you know, I had the opportunity over the weekend to speak with many of my European and other international colleagues because we had the G–20 and the IMF meetings here in Washington, and so we had plenty of opportunities to discuss the European situation.  I think it’s true that the Europeans have made substantial progress overall.  I include not only the two LTRO operations,  11 of 23 April 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  but also the Greek debt deal, the work on the fiscal compact, and recently the setting up of a larger financial firewall that could be used to avoid contagion should another country face serious financial distress.  So progress has been made, but obviously, judging by market conditions, there’s still more work to be done, and we are counting on our European colleagues to continue to follow through their commitments and to put very strong effort into addressing what remain significant problems and concerns in Europe. 

[SECTION]

ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times.  Mr. Chairman, two questions.  First, to follow up on Steve’s point about the interest rate forecast earlier:  There are now only four FOMC participants who forecast that rates will still be close to zero at the end of 2014.  Given that you said the Committee is entirely happy with that language in the statement, what information can we then take from the forecasts when they change like that?  The second point—sorry—if you were to decide you wanted to do more to support the economy at some point, could you run us through the set of feasible options to do that?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.  Well, if you compare this set of forecasts with reiterate that, once again, that these are just inputs into a decision process.  They represent individual estimates, and, quite admittedly, as many of the participants said around the table, you know, these are uncertain from an individual point of view.  And as we discussed the range of considerations, including the fact that we remain uncertain about how the economy is going to evolve, I’ve talked about, for example, the so-called Okun’s law puzzle about whether or not unemployment will continue fall quickly or whether it will begin to level out.  Given those uncertainties, given the risks like the European situation or the fiscal cliff that we’ve just discussed here, that there was a quite reasonable case for maintaining the guidance at late 2014.   12 of 23 April 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  And as I said, there was a great deal of comfort among the participants and the Committee members with maintaining this guidance. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  Greg Robb, MarketWatch.com.  Judging from some of the speeches lately from Fed officials, it looks like too-big-to-fail is—they view this as the next step where attention should be paid and work should be done.  There’s even a proposal to have legislation to force bank divestitures.  Could you talk about your views on these things?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  I believe that too-big-to-fail was an important cause, or at least a propagating mechanism, of the financial crisis.  And I believe it’s absolutely incumbent upon us to do all we can to eliminate too-big-to-fail.  And what I mean by that is, a situation where a failing firm is bailed out because its collapse would have such adverse circumstance—consequences for the rest of the financial system.  So we are working to get rid of too-big-to-fail, and I think making some progress.   First of all, we are very substantially increasing the supervisory and regulatory oversight of large financial institutions; that includes, for example, the Basel III rules that require higher capital for all banks but particularly for systemically important banks, more liquidity requirements, stress tests, a range of tougher supervisory requirements that are—many of them are embedded in the rule we put out on 165–166, that section of the Dodd–Frank Act.  So the first thing we’re going to do is make sure that these large institutions are stronger, that it’s much harder for them to fail, and that they are watched much more carefully and more actively by the supervisors.   The other part of eliminating too-big-to-fail, though, is that, in that circumstance where a large complex financial firm does come to the brink of failure, that it must be allowed to fail; it  13 of 23 April 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  must be safe to fail.  And in that respect, one of the principal tools that we’ve gotten from Dodd–Frank is a so-called orderly liquidation authority, which is the FDIC’s tool, and the Federal Reserve is working closely with the FDIC there.  The idea is to apply the same kind of bank resolution tools that the FDIC has used for many years on domestic banks to large complex financial firms.   Now, obviously, the complexity and the international aspects of these firms make that a much more challenging task, but I think we’re making progress there.  We have put out rules about so-called living wills, which will require large financial firms to essentially plan out how they would be disassembled.  And we’ve continued to talk with international colleagues about how we would cooperate if a multinational firm had to be put into receivership.  And, indeed, part of the reason that there’s been some downgrade or potential downgrade for some U.S. financial institutions is the judgment of the ratings agencies that the so-called implicit government support that these institutions have is less than in the past.  And so, I think, ultimately, what we’ll need to have is a situation where large firms are both making judgments about their size and complexity based only on the economic benefits and costs and not on too-big-to-fail considerations, and that if there is failure, that it can be done and achieved without highly adverse consequences for the financial system and the economy.  And that’s our objective, and that’s the way, I think, to end too-big-to-fail. 

[SECTION]

CATHERINE HOLLANDER.  You’ve been working hard to improve communications with both markets and the general public.  What’s your assessment of how both is done? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think that’s part of your job to say.  I think we’re making progress.  I think it was an important step to make clear what our inflation objective is—I thought that was important.  And we put out a statement that described the overall policy  14 of 23 April 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  approach of the Federal Reserve.  We’ve taken a number of steps to improve communication, including these press conferences, of course.  But also, by expanding our projections and by continued, you know, work doing press—doing,sorry, doing testimonies and speeches, and most recently as you know, I did some classes—I taught some classes at a local university.   So we’re doing our best both—to achieve, really, two objectives.  One is to help make the Fed a little bit more understandable to the average person, because many people don’t understand all the arcane aspects of the Federal Reserve and of monetary policy.  And to be good voters and good citizens, they need to understand, you know, something about what the Fed does.  And also, to communicate with markets so that markets can better appreciate, you know, what our monetary policy plans are in order so that interest rates and other asset prices can appropriately reflect those plans.  I think the evidence on the latter point is that there is a better understanding of the Fed’s policies.  And, you know, we’ve seen, for example, less volatility in interest rates related to greater certainty about what the Fed is likely to do.   But I want to emphasize that this is an ongoing task, it’s a work in progress, and we’re going to continue to look for ways to make ourselves better understand—more understandable and more transparent to the public. 

[SECTION]

GREG IP.  Greg Ip of the Economist.  First, assume that you are not constrained by the zero nominal bound right now.  What would the federal funds rate be, even if it were a negative number?  And do you believe that you are at an equivalent degree of monetary accommodation today using your unconventional tools?  And also, a quick supplemental—could you put some numbers on what—on the meaning of “exceptionally low” federal funds rate?  For example, would a 1 percent federal funds rate qualify as “exceptionally low” at the end of 2014?  15 of 23 April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the exact reading for the federal funds rate today, in the absence of the zero lower bound, would depend a lot on which particular rule, what particular model that you use.  I don’t want to cite a particular number, but it probably would be negative.  And in that respect, we are trying to compensate for that by the use of nonstandard tools, including, as you know, almost a $3 trillion balance sheet.   We see monetary policy as being approximately in the right place at this point, based on the analysis that we’ve been doing in—of the economy and the outlook.  That doesn’t mean we might not take further action; we are certainly prepared to take further action.  But for the time being, it appears that we are more or less in the right place. 

[SECTION]

GREG IP.  “Exceptionally low”? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  “Exceptionally low”; you know, one of the reasons that language in the statement is sometimes a little vaguer than you would like is because we are trying to get a consensus among 17 or at least 10 people, and different members or participants in the FOMC might have somewhat different views of what “exceptionally low” means.  Personally, I think it means something close to where we are—where we are now. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Chairman, Donna Borak with American Banker.  To follow up on the too-big-to-fail question, there has been acute discussion in recent months about calling for breaking up the banks even louder than before, even including some Fed officials.  And you just talked about the need to eliminate too-big-to-fail.  Of course, Dodd–Frank—that’s the intent of it.  My question is twofold:  Do you agree?  And is there an argument to be made for breaking up the banks?  And is that something that the Fed should consider when weighing the importance of financial stability?  And, sort of, to this earlier point that you made is, what in your view is the  16 of 23 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  litmus test that will allow us to know that we can achieve ending too-big-to-fail through Dodd– Frank? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, there may be circumstances where a bank or financial institution is artificially large.  And in that context, if it were posing a severe threat to financial stability, then I suppose that considering breaking it up would be something that regulators should look at.  My own view, though, is that a more market-responsive way to address this problem is to eliminate the incentive to be too-big-to-fail.  That is, to—through tougher supervisory oversight, through higher capital requirements, through greater liquidity requirements, through restrictions on interconnectedness, et cetera, take away the benefits or force firms to internalize the costs of being large and complex.  And on the other side, as I was saying earlier, if we can safely unwind a failing firm, then we no longer have too-big-to-fail, obviously, and so I think that’s a very, very important objective.  The test would be that the financial markets that lend to large firms base their bond spreads and what they’re willing to pay for the stock of those firms solely on the risk-taking and on the business model of those firms and not on the fact that there’s some anticipation of a government bailout.  And so I think market indicators will help us see our progress towards ending too-big-to-fail. 

[SECTION]

STEVE BECKNER.  Steve Beckner of Market News International.  Mr. Chairman, good to see you.  There’s been some concern in markets about what will happen to bond yields at the expiration of Operation Twist on June 30th and some speculation on what the Fed might do—might need to do to keep downward pressure on yields.  Is that a concern that you share?  And do you and your colleagues feel the need not to disappoint these kinds of market expectations? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, to your last point, the purpose of monetary policy is to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price stability, it’s not to disappoint or  17 of 23 April 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  not disappoint investors.  So we will take actions based on those economic objectives and not try to achieve certain market outcomes.   There’s some disagreement, I think, about exactly how balance sheet actions by the Federal Reserve affect Treasury yields and other asset prices.  The view that we have generally taken at the Fed, in which I think—for which I think the evidence is pretty good, is that it’s the quantity of securities held by the Fed at a given time rather than the new purchases—the flow of new purchases—which is the primary determinant of interest rates.  And if that theory is correct, then at such time that our purchases come to an end, there should be relatively minimal effects on interest rates at that time.  And that, in fact, has been our—generally our experience in previous episodes where we have launched a program and then allowed it to come to a natural end.   Of course, we’ll continue to monitor the situation, and if we believe that financial conditions for whatever reason are inconsistent with our macroeconomic objectives, then we will act to fix that.  But, again, our expectation is that, at whatever point that the purchases end, that financial markets being quite forward looking will have anticipated that, and that the effects ought to be moderate. 

[SECTION]

AKIO FUJII.  Thank you, Chairman.  I am Akio Fujii from Nikkei newspaper.  My question is follow-up for your comment about Japan and U.S.  Now, are you confident U.S. economy would avoid long-term stagnation like we had in Japan, or so-called Japanization?  And if it’s the case, only policy response make a difference of Japan and U.S., or are there any other factor make difference? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The last part again—are there measures?  18 of 23 April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL   

[SECTION]

AKIO FUJII.  Yes, policy response is the only reason make a difference U.S. and Japan or are there any other factor make a difference of U.S. and Japan situation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think the—I would draw two distinctions between the U.S. and Japan, or the Japanese experience.  The first is that, as I mentioned earlier—and I think this is very important—is that we acted aggressively and preemptively to avoid deflation.  Now, of course, Japan had a much bigger bubble and a much bigger shock when the bubble collapsed, and so these differences may be certainly understandable.  But, again, we did avoid deflation.  The other thing which I think we have done reasonably well here in the United States was that we moved fairly quickly to make sure that our banks were recapitalized and were recognizing their bad assets.  And I think the stress tests that we conducted last month are good evidence that the U.S. banking system is considerably stronger and, indeed, much more resilient than it was a couple of years ago.   So those two things are positives and would tend to suggest that we will avoid some of the problems that Japan has faced.  That being said, I think it’s always better to be humble and just to, you know, avoid being too confident.  And we need to continue to maintain a strong monetary policy support to make sure that the economy continues on a recovery path and returns to a more normal situation. 

[SECTION]

SCOTT SPOERRY.  Scott Spoerry with CNNMoney, sir.  I wanted to ask you about the labor force participation rate.  It’s at the lowest level since the early ’80s.  Can you talk about why people are dropping out of the job market, whether it’s a permanent structural problem, and what convinces you that things may change?  If I could just a pop a second question to follow up on Steve and the bonds—your colleague Sheila Bair wrote this week that her—about her concern  19 of 23 April 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  over being in a bond bubble.  She said you should declare victory, and you should do something about puncturing that bubble before it gets too much out of control.  Can you respond to that too? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  On declaring victory, I think it’s a little premature to for the bond bubble, interest rates are low for a lot of reasons; they include monetary policy, of course, but they also include a weak economy, low inflation expectations, and safe-haven demands for U.S. Treasuries.  So, of course, interest rates will rise at some point.  We hope that they do because that would be an indication that the economy is recovering and strengthening.  And I think it’s important for holders of long-term securities to manage their risks and pay attention to that.  But all that being said, I think, again, that there are both good reasons to continue monetary ease and good reasons for interest rates to be low.  The first part of your question was—

SCOTT SPOERRY.  About the—  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Oh, participation, labor participation, yes.  Actually, we had a very good discussion of that at the meeting because it is an important issue, trying to assess how much of the change in employment is structural, how much is cyclical, and so on.  There is, in fact, a downward trend in labor participation in the United States.  It comes from, first, the fact that we’re no longer getting increased participation from women; female participation has leveled out.  And, secondly, because, as the society ages, and also for other reasons, male participation has been declining over time.  So there is a downward trend that we have to take into account.   The participants at the meeting, at least some of them, suggested, though, that a good bit of the decline in participation that we’ve seen in the last few years does represent cyclical  20 of 23 April 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  factors.  Much of it is young people, for example, who presumably are not out of the labor force indefinitely, but, given the weak job market, they are going to school or doing something else rather than working.  So one possibility and one reason why the unemployment rate may not fall as quickly going forward is that as the economy strengthens, as the labor market strengthens, many of these folks are going to come back in the labor force looking for work, which I think would be a good thing.  But we’ll just have to see.  But I do think—I think I would agree with the argument that a significant part of the decline over and above the downward trend in the participation rate is reflecting cyclical factors and should reverse when the economy gets stronger.   

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Don Lee from the L.A. Times.  Can you give us your assessment of the impact of the mild winter weather on job growth and what that might mean going forward?  And related to that, I think you said last month that some of the recent job gains reflected a catch-up from outsize cuts right after the recession.  I mean, given those two things, what kind of job growth can we expect? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the weather issue just reflects how difficult it can be to make real-time assessments of the state of the economy.  The weather has probably affected a number of things.  It probably brought forward some of the hiring so that it made perhaps probably affected construction, manufacturing.  There’s a number of things that were probably affected to some extent by the unusually warm weather that we had this winter, and we’re doing our best to try to adjust for that.  We’re also looking at some of the seasonality issues that have arisen because of the unusually large recession in 2008 and 2009.  So, again, that makes the data harder to interpret.    21 of 23 April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL   I advanced the hypothesis that the increase in employment we’ve seen in the last five, six months might to some extent be greater than we’d expect going forward because it represented a one-time catch-up, undoing the very sharp layoffs in 2008 and 2009.  That’s only a hypothesis.  We’ll have to see going forward.  If it’s correct, then job gains will be somewhat less than the 250,000 a month that we’ve been seeing recently.  But we don’t know yet, we don’t know yet.  And I wouldn’t draw too much conclusion from the March report.  I think, again, because of weather and other factors, we really can’t take a conclusive result from that.  So, we’ll continue to be watching the labor market.  That’s a very important consideration.  If unemployment looks like it’s no longer making progress, that’ll be an important consideration in thinking about policy options. projections that you’ve made? 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  What kind of job growth, on average, is consistent with the unemployment 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we need something—estimates differ.  We need fewer jobs monthly to keep unemployment consistent or stable than in the past—I suppose more like 100,000 a month for stability.  I don’t have an exact answer, but broadly speaking, 150–200,000 jobs or so.  But that’s a very rough estimate, and, of course, individual participants may have different views.   Again, that’s not a forecast, I’ve made a hypothesis, which would imply slower improvement in unemployment.  But the possibility, of course, exists that this recovery will generate a virtuous circle with greater hiring, which in turn generates more consumer spending, and greater hiring, and so on.  That remains to be seen, and, of course, which way that goes is going to be a very important determinant of our response.  22 of 23 April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL

PETER COOK.  Mr. Chairman, Peter Cook with Bloomberg Television.  Thank you for the time.  First up, sir, on the projections—in your bid for transparency, for more openness here at the Fed, would you consider, in the future, you and your colleagues actually attaching your name to the projections here so that, again, markets, folks out in the—watching your actions get a better sense of exactly what you’re thinking in the future, what your colleagues are thinking?  And separately, sir, as you consider where you are at this moment, all you’ve been through with the financial crisis, the recovery, what is it right now that most frustrates you about this recovery, that still confounds you most about this recovery, that confuses you most? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, those things are not all the same.  On the former, our subcommittee, headed by Vice Chair Yellen, is looking at the SEP for ways to improve transparency, and we’re looking at everything.  So, your particular suggestion is on the table, as are other ways to try to make this more useful.  And, again, it’s a work in progress, as I said before.   The most frustrating aspect, I guess, of the recovery has been that it’s—has been that it’s been quite slow.  And as a result, here we are, almost three years from the beginning of the expansion, and the unemployment rate is still over 8 percent.  So we’re looking and hoping that as the headwinds lift, as financial stresses ease, as housing improves, that we’ll begin to get more rapid improvement in the economy and in the labor market.  But it has been a very long slog, and that, I think, would be the single most concerning thing.  From a policy perspective, there are many issues, like the fiscal issues, for example.  But within the province of the Federal Reserve, I think it would be the pace of improvement in the labor market. Thank you.   23 of 23",Ben Bernanke,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
5,2012-06-20,"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon.  Before we get to questions, I’ll summarize today’s policy action by the Federal Open Market Committee and then place the Committee’s appropriate path of monetary policy.   As indicated in the statement released earlier this afternoon, the Committee is maintaining a highly accommodative policy.  We decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and we continue to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.  In addition, the Committee decided to continue through the end of the year our program of lengthening the maturity of our securities holdings rather than completing the program this month as previously scheduled.  Specifically, the Committee intends to purchase Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years at the current pace and to sell or redeem an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less.  The details of our plans for our securities purchases and sales were described in an accompanying statement released today and can be found on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s website.  The continuation of the maturity extension program should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and make broader financial conditions more accommodative than they would otherwise be, thereby supporting economic recovery.   In conjunction with today’s meeting, FOMC participants—the 7 Board members and the 12 Reserve Bank presidents—submitted their individual economic projections and policy assessments for the years 2012 to 2014 and over the longer run.  These projections are important  1 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL inputs to the Committee’s deliberations.  Incoming information suggests that the economy continues to expand at a moderate pace in the face of headwinds generated by the situation in Europe, a still-depressed housing market, tight credit for some borrowers, and fiscal restraint at the federal, state, and local levels.  Business and household spending are increasing at rates consistent with moderate economic growth, though household spending appears to be rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier this year.  Employment gains have been smaller in recent months, and the unemployment rate, at 8.2 percent, remains elevated.  In light of these developments, Committee participants have generally marked down their projections for economic growth, but most still see the economy as expanding at a moderate pace over coming quarters and then picking up gradually.   Based on their projections for economic growth, FOMC participants foresee slower progress in reducing unemployment than they did in April.  Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency of 8.0 to 8.2 percent, declining to 7.0 percent to 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, levels that would remain above participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rates of unemployment.  In addition to projecting only slow progress in bringing down unemployment, most participants see the risks to the outlook weighted mainly toward slower growth and higher unemployment.  In particular, participants noted that strains in global financial markets, associated principally with the situation in Europe, continue to pose significant risks to the recovery and to further improvement in labor market conditions.   Meanwhile, inflation has declined recently, primarily reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline.  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, and the Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium run will run at or below the 2 percent rate that it judges  2 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL most consistent with its statutory mandate for maximum employment and price stability.  More specifically, participants’ projections of inflation have a central tendency of 1.2 to 1.7 percent for 2012 and 1.5 to 2.0 percent for 2014.  The economic projections submitted by FOMC participants are conditioned on their individual assessments of the appropriate path of monetary policy.  As you can see from the chart, Committee participants have a range of views about when the initial increase in the federal funds rate is likely to be warranted.   After a thorough discussion of those views, and of the ongoing uncertainty and risks surrounding the outlook, the FOMC—as I mentioned—maintained its collective judgment that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014, and it agreed to provide further support to the economy by continuing the maturity extension program.  The Committee is prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.   Thank you.  I’d be glad to take your questions. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, looking back on the last four years of Fed policy, I think it’s probably fair to say it has been bold and yet at the same time halting.  You did QE1 and then you stopped and then you did QE2.  You did “Operation Twist” and you told us it was going to end in June; now you’ve extended it.  How would you respond if, several years from now, a young MIT graduate student came forward and said, “You know what the problem with Fed policy was during this period is it was too incremental, and that the reason why the economy underperformed was because of that incrementalism.”  And what do you think the dangers are right now that today’s action is also too incremental?  3 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, of course, you know, we cut the federal funds rate in a continuous fashion until December of 2008.  And since then, we’ve been operating with nonstandard monetary tools, including asset purchases and extension of maturities.  By their nature, these tend to be lumpy.  We haven’t done them in a continuous way.  But our view of the effects of these programs on the economy is that the total stock of outstanding securities in our portfolio is what determines the level of accommodation that the economy is receiving.  So in that respect, it wouldn’t be really a start and stop; rather, whenever we have stopped purchasing, the level of accommodation that was already in the system remains there until conditions warrant further action.  Now, underlying all this, of course, is the fact that the outlook has changed.  Like many other forecasters, the Federal Reserve was too optimistic early in the recovery about the pace of recovery.  And we’ve had to add additional accommodation going forward, as we have seen, in fact, that the headwinds have kept the recovery from being as strong as we would like.  But, again, by the nature of these unconventional tools, they are—tend to be more discreet in their size, but they continue to have accommodative effects even after the pattern of purchases has ended. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Don’t you worry about incrementalism now?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we’ve taken a step today, which is a substantive step, which will provide additional accommodation for the economy.  And, moreover, we have stated that we’re prepared to take further steps if necessary to promote sustainable growth and recovery in the labor market.  So, we are prepared to do what’s necessary.  We are prepared to provide support for the economy. have characterized today’s step as somewhat modest.  Your own outlook has a much lower GDP  4 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL projection.  The unemployment rate in your outlook is—shows possibly no improvement at all in the unemployment rate through the end of this year.  The program itself is smaller and of shorter duration than the original Operation Twist.  Given this weaker outlook, why such a modest program?  And when you say you are prepared to take further action, which is a stronger characterization than in your last meeting, does that mean you are prepared to do a full-on new asset purchase program? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, there’s been a great deal of economic news since our last meeting.  The incoming data were somewhat disappointing—but not entirely clear how to read them.  We had issues with weather and seasonal adjustment and other factors.  Meanwhile, Europe has had additional problems.  We’ve seen some of those effects in financial markets.  So, I think, there is some case to be made for making some additional judgments about where the economy is going.  That being said, the step we took, the extension of the maturity extension program, I think, is a substantive step, and it will provide some additional support.  And yes, additional asset purchases would be among the things that we would certainly consider if we need to take additional measures to strengthen the economy. 

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Mr. Chairman, I’d like to ask you to respond to a different set of criticisms.  This criticism—which you hear from Capitol Hill and Wall Street and different places—is that the Fed has already pushed interest rates to an extraordinarily low level, a historically low level, and that there isn’t anything more that the Fed can do to help the recovery.  That—the criticism is that the Fed at this point should stand down and let Congress or the White House attend to the economy’s ailments or let market forces attend to the economy’s ailments.  What do you think of those arguments, and how would you respond to them?  5 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as I’ve said many times, monetary policy is not a panacea.  Monetary policy by itself is not going to solve our economic problems.  We welcome help and support from any other part of the government, from other economic policymakers.  So, collaboration is—would be great.  I wouldn’t accept the proposition, though, that the Fed has no more ammunition.  I do think that our tools, while they are nonstandard, still can create more-accommodative financial conditions, can still provide support for the economy, can still help us return to a more normal economic situation.  That being said, again, any other support that is forthcoming, any other economic policies that are undertaken that are helpful in terms of making our economy stronger are welcome.  But I do think that monetary policy still does have some capacity to strengthen the economy by easing financial conditions. 

[SECTION]

ZACH GOLDFARB.  Thank you.  Mitt Romney recently said that QE2 had a relatively little impact on the economy.  He said that was in part because of the President’s policies, and he said that QE3 was unwarranted and could have negative effects.  Do you agree that QE2 had little effect on the economy?  Do you think the President’s policies has had an effect on the effectiveness of monetary policy?  And do you think it’s appropriate for a presidential candidate to comment on the future path of monetary policy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I’ll just say first that we think that both of the asset purchase programs, so-called QE1 and QE2, did have significant effects on asset prices and financial conditions.  And although there were certain problems in transmission—for example, the housing market has not been as responsive as it’s been in some times in the past—we do think that they were both effective in providing support for the economy, and in particular, so-called QE2 ended what looked to be an incipient deflation problem when we first introduced it.  So, I do think those have been effective, and as I said to Mr. Hilsenrath, we think that these kinds  6 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL of programs can still provide additional support.  With respect to the rest of your questions, I just want to reiterate that the Federal Reserve is nonpartisan, we are very serious about taking our to do that. 

[SECTION]

JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Thanks.  Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Times.  Long-term interest rates, mortgage rates are already at historic lows.  How much more help can an extension of Operation Twist do and—to lower interest rates? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the interest rates are quite low, and they’re being pushed down more by safe-haven flows and other factors.  That being said, I think we can lower interest rates more.  But beyond that, Operation Twist and asset purchases work also through other channels.  In particular, by acquiring securities in the market and bringing them onto the Fed’s balance sheet, we essentially induce investors to move into substitute securities.  So, for example, an investor who sells a Treasury security to the Fed may end up buying a corporate bond instead, and so the effect will be to lower corporate bond rates and corporate spreads.  Or a bank may, having sold its Treasury securities, may decide to make a loan instead.  So, it’s not just the effect on the long-term interest rate, but there’s a broader set of effects that feed through other asset prices, other interest rates, other spreads, and provide a broader ease in financial conditions which is supportive to the economy. 

[SECTION]

JEFF KEARNS.  Thank you.  Jeff Kearns from Bloomberg News.  Given the projections today going out to ’14, seeing unemployment almost where it is now for another two years, can you look past 2014, and can you—now that we’re five years past the top of the stock market, six years past the top of the housing market, can this go on for a decade?  Can this go on longer?  Can you reassure Americans that it won’t go on for a dozen years like the Depression?  7 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it’s our intention to do all we can to make sure that it doesn’t go on indefinitely.  Unemployment is still too high, but it has come down.  It was about 10 percent at the peak, and now it’s closer to 8 percent.  It’s going down too slowly, but it is going down.  Our sense is that people are finding jobs, but just not at the rate that we would like to see.  And, you know, as I said, and as the statement says, if we don’t see continued improvement in the labor market, we’ll be prepared to take additional steps if appropriate. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, New York Times.  I’m looking at the projections you all released today that show that unemployment will be between 8 and 8.2 percent at the end of the year.  You told Congress earlier this month that the defining factor in your decision about whether to do more would be whether unemployment was coming down.  That’s barely a decrease.  And I guess I’m struggling to understand why, in that context, you are not doing more now, particularly when you say that you can do more and that you would do more if it wasn’t happening. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, first of all, again, we are—we did take a substantive step today by extending the maturity extension program to the end of the year.  Again, I think that’s a meaningful additional step. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  The projections included that step, right?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It depends on—each individual has their own path of optimal policy, so we’ll provide more information about that in the minutes.  But—and again, we’re prepared to do more.  We have to get, I think, further information about the state of the economy, about where things are going, about what’s happening in Europe.  I guess I would add to that, though, that, you know, each of these nonstandard programs does have various costs and risks associated with it with respect to market functioning, with respect to financial stability, with  8 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL respect to the exit process, and so I don’t think they should be launched lightly.  I think there should be some conviction that they’re needed, but if we do come to that conviction, then we’ll take those additional steps. 

[SECTION]

KRISTINA PETERSON.  Kristina Peterson, Dow Jones.  I know that you’ve said that European policymakers are the first line of defense for the European debt crisis, but under what circumstances would the Fed decide to get more directly involved or coordinate action with other central banks? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as you say, the Europeans are the first line.  Europe is a wealthy area.  They have adequate resources to address these problems.  They are very committed to addressing these problems because keeping the euro zone together, keeping the euro-zone trading bloc together is very important to the economies of those countries, so we leave to them the leadership.  The Federal Reserve is very much involved in talking with and consulting with European leaders.  I talk frequently to central bankers in Europe, including course, coordinate earlier in the provision of the dollar swaps to other central banks, which have been useful in reducing pressures in dollar funding markets and allowing European banks to continue lending in dollars, including to U.S. borrowers.  So, at this point, we are consulting frequently.  We are prepared to work together if that can be done constructively.  But at this point, you know, we are mostly just in consultation mode. 

[SECTION]

PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes, Fox Business.  Sir, you had talked about trying to get about the “fiscal cliff.”  Have you seen any evidence that the lack of progress on resolving the fiscal-cliff issue is having an impact on the economy right now?  Is it slowing economic growth  9 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL right now, job creation as we saw last year during this very same debate?  And if you’re not seeing it, and if you haven’t seen it yet, when could we—might we start to see it hit the economy and hurt the economy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think it’s still a bit early, but as we move forward in the year, we do anticipate that the uncertainty associated with the so-called fiscal cliff will have some economic effects.  We heard anecdotes today in the meeting about firms that might be government contractors that were, you know, not sure about whether the contracts would still be in place come January and making employment decisions based on that.  More generally, financial markets don’t like uncertainty and, particularly, uncertainty of this magnitude, and that, I think, will be a negative.  So that uncertainty is there, that’s going to be an issue.  I think most importantly, though, is that Congress get the policy right.  I’ve talked about three elements for fiscal policy.  The first is to do no harm as far as the recovery is concerned, to try to avoid a fiscal cliff that would significantly damage the recovery.  But second, to maintain the effort to achieve a sustainable fiscal path over the longer term.  And third, to use fiscal policy effectively—to have a better tax code, to make good use of government spending programs and make them efficient and effective, and so on.  So I think if Congress does all those things, the ultimate benefits would be substantial. 

[SECTION]

PETER COOK.  Peter Cook with Bloomberg Television.  If I could follow up on my colleague Peter Barnes’s question regarding the fiscal cliff, just listening to your answer here, how beneficial would it be for the U.S. economy right now, given some of the talk on Capitol Hill that the lawmakers and the Administration deal with the fiscal-cliff issues, perhaps temporarily kick the can down the road into next year, deal with it sooner rather than later.   10 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL Would that end—limit, at least, some of that uncertainty in the short term?  Would that be beneficial given the state of the economy at this present moment? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, that’s a difficult problem.  I’m not entirely sure.  On the one hand, a little clarity would probably be helpful for the reasons that I described, because people are uncertain about what’s going to happen.  On the other hand, investors I know would like to see Congress take actions that put us on a long-term, sustainable fiscal path, and simply kicking the can down the road without any other indication of what might be done, what kinds of policies might be enacted, could be a negative for sentiment because it might induce people to worry more about the seriousness of Congress in addressing our fiscal issues. 

[SECTION]

SHAHIEN NASIRIPOUR.  Shahien Nasiripour with the Financial Times.  Mr. Chairman, one critique of the Fed’s accommodative actions over the past few years has been that it’s helped those with the least propensity to spend—the wealthy, large businesses and corporations—while the Fed’s impact on those with the most propensity to spend—the cash-strapped and middle-income households—has been muted.  I was hoping that you could perhaps address this criticism, particularly with a focus on access to credit. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.  Well, access to credit is a major issue, there’s no question about it.  Mortgage access is much tighter than it’s been for a long time.  Even credit card access is more restricted than it has been in the past.  And that—what that does is, to some extent, it mutes the impact of the Fed’s actions.  That being said, I don’t think it’s at all accurate to say that Federal Reserve policy is not helping the broad public.  First of all, many Americans are able to take advantage of lower interest rates.  Many people have refinanced or bought homes.  Others have taken out loans to buy cars.  Auto loans are cheap and broadly available.  So, there has been impact through lower interest rates, but I think more broadly is the indirect  11 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL effects.  If a firm has a low cost of capital, and we’ve seen a lot of corporate borrowing in the last couple of years, then they’re more likely to expand, to add capital, to add products, and, consequently, they are more likely to hire.  And although, again, the extent to which the payrolls have increased in the last few years has been disappointing, there have been significant increases, and the unemployment rate has come down by 2 percentage points.  Some of that comes from the broad impact of Fed policy on spending, on investment, and those effects affect the broad public indirectly by promoting hiring and by promoting demand for products that people are producing. 

[SECTION]

KEVIN HALL.  Hi, thanks.  Kevin Hall with McClatchy Newspapers.  If you could flesh out a little bit more detail about what—where you think the choke points are in the economy.  SIFMA yesterday had their midyear outlook conference call in which they blamed a full percentage point of the slowdown on fiscal cliff and, more importantly, Europe and said, you know, much bigger pass-through than anyone anticipated.  Today, the Business Roundtable said, Europe, not so much; it’s basically the economy.  The CEO of Boeing said, clearly, we’re already trimming jobs, we’re already cutting back; everybody else in the aerospace, he thinks, is doing the same.  What are you hearing?  Are you on the phone with people your predecessor was given to calling occasionally?  What is your sense of where the choke points are that are continuing to thwart hiring? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.  I gave a list of some of the headwinds in my opening remarks.  I do think that the European situation is slowing U.S. economic growth.  First of all, Europe is, if not in a recession in every country, certainly many countries are in recession, and that affects our trade with Europe and the demand for our products.  More broadly, the effects of European concerns on financial markets have added to volatility, have brought down stock prices, have increased credit spreads, and generally have been a negative for economic growth.   12 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL So that has been an issue.  And more broadly, we’ve seen some slowing in global economic growth more generally, including in Asia, which also has reduced somewhat our ability to export.  So that’s one set of concerns that’s been important.  I’d mentioned two others, I think, as being primarily important.  One is housing.  Housing usually plays a very important role in economic recovery, both through construction itself and related industries, but also because higher house prices increase consumer wealth and promote consumer spending.  Housing does seem to be doing somewhat better.  There are some good signs in housing, but nevertheless, we are not getting the size of the boost, the amount of help in the recovery that we would normally get from a housing recovery.  The other area is, as you indicated, is fiscal.  And that happens at all different levels:  federal, state, and local.  Notwithstanding programs earlier on, in the last year or two and going forward we have been seeing fiscal consolidation.  Particularly at the state and local level, of course, tight budgets have led to a lot of layoffs and cancellation of projects and so on.  I understand that these are necessary steps from the perspective of individual states and localities.  I’m not criticizing that; it’s just a fact, though, that these contractions are affecting the pace of growth in the broader economy.  So I think those would be the main things I would point to, and put them all together, and you have an economy which is growing less quickly than it normally would following a recession of the magnitude that we saw. that you’ve sketched out and the fact that interest rates are at historically low points, would it make sense—would it be an option for the government to issue more long-term debt at this point and take advantage of that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the government is very gradually increasing the duration of its debt—the Treasury, I mean—and it’s been doing that for some period of time.   13 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL There’s a bit of an issue here, which is that what the Federal Reserve is doing with the program we announced today, the maturity extension program, is we’re taking longer-term debt off the rates.  To the extent that the Treasury actively sought to lengthen duration of its borrowing, it would, to some extent, offset the benefits of that—of those policies.  So my understanding of what the Treasury is doing is that they have a plan, they’re sticking to that plan, and therefore, on the margin, the effects of the Fed’s actions can be felt.

DARREN GERSH.  Darren Gersh with Nightly Business Report.  You clearly seem to be waiting on the labor market.  Can you be a little more specific?  What exactly are you looking for?  Is there a rate of job growth you need to look—to see?  And also, if the unemployment rate comes down, is that enough?  Or are you going to also look at labor participation and the whole gestalt? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I can’t give you any specific numbers because this is ultimately a Committee decision, but what the Committee is going to do is review all the labor improving in a sustainable way.  It’s not a month-to-month proposition.  You know, this year already, we’ve seen a few months of very strong job gains, and we saw two months of weaker gains.  Obviously, month to month, there is going to be statistical noise—there is going to be weather, there’s going to be a lot of factors that can cause job gains to vary.  So the question is, is the improvement sustainable?  Is it long lasting?  That’s the kind of thing that we’ll be looking at, but I really can’t be too much more specific than that.  14 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL

STEVE BECKNER.  Steve Beckner, Market News International.  Mr. Chairman, when we—when you speak of the fiscal cliff, typically you don’t differentiate between the automatic tax-hike aspect of that and the automatic spending cuts, which leaves the impression that you are giving equal weight to both sides.  Some would contend that the automatic tax hikes would be more onerous.  How do you parse the relative importance of those two aspects?  And if I may be permitted, I am also curious to know how the Fed is going to conduct open market operations, if, as the New York Fed statement says, by the end of this year, they will essentially have no short-term securities to use. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, on the fiscal cliff, I mean, just the way that the programs are set up, the dollar amount associated with the tax expirations—tax-cut expirations, including the payroll tax cut and so on, is larger than the spending cuts, as I understand it.  But I’m not making any judgment about individual programs.  The point here is that putting all these things together, you have a very substantial withdrawal of income from the economy that will affect spending and will affect the ability of the economy to recover in the short run.  Now, again, in making decisions about, you know, how to modify those automatic changes, Congress obviously has to look at the long run, you know—what is the most efficient tax structure, what’s the best way to spend our limited resources?  Those are tough decisions that Congress has to make, but in terms of the fiscal cliff, in terms of what’s going to happen in January, the—it’s really the total of both spending cuts and tax increases which has the impact, which not only we, but others like the Congressional Budget Office, have identified as being a concern.  We’ll still be able to do open market operations with our securities, even if the amount of short-term debt is very low.  And indeed, of course, over time, the—as securities come close to maturation, we will have other securities that are of short duration.  15 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL

DONNA BORAK.  Hi Chairman, Donna Borak with American Banker.  There have been a lot of questions raised as to whether the Volcker rule would have helped prohibit the trading loss of J.P. Morgan.  Given that regulators are in the middle of the rule-writing process and also examining what exactly went wrong, as a supervisor, do you think at this moment it’s the right time to perhaps “pump the brakes,” so to speak, and slow down the rule-writing process or has this recent episode really made it a stronger case for proceeding with the Volcker rule expeditiously?  And, secondly, if I may, since—given that you’ve suggested that regulators might be late on the rule, surpassing the July 21st deadline, could you perhaps give us a target on when regulators are looking to release the rule?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, on the second question, it’s a five-agency rule, I believe, and so a lot of coordination and cooperation is needed, and we had something like 18,000 comment letters, so it’s been a very difficult process in terms of the amount of work that has to be done, amount of coordination that has to be done, so I don’t have a date for you.  I think if there’s a silver lining to the events you referred to, it may be that there’s some things we can learn in terms of writing the rule and thinking about how it would work.  One aspect of our rule that I think would have been important in the context of the loss is that, in the rule, a bank would be required to provide a plan in advance explaining how the hedge was going to be done, how it was going to work.  It would be necessary to have an auditing process to make sure that, in fact, that was being followed, that there were adequate risk management and governance rules to oversee the process, and it would be necessary that compensation for the executives involved in the management of the position would not be such that it would incentivize them to take proprietary positions.  So, one aspect of the rule that might have been relevant—and again, we  16 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL are still looking at that situation, as are the OCC and others—would have been the control, the governance aspects of it, and that might have potentially changed the outcome. Europe have to get before it starts seriously denting the prospects for recovery in the American economy, and thus really changing the direction of Fed’s policymaking? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we hope it doesn’t get worse.  I think it’s already one of the factors that has been a drag on U.S. recovery—not the only factor by any means, there are a number of others that I mentioned, but it has been having an effect, and it’s been having an effect on the economies of other countries as well, countries that export to Europe.  So it is a significant issue.  We are hopeful that Europe will take additional measures and do all that’s necessary to stabilize the situation and to provide the basis for an ongoing stable structure that—in which banks and sovereigns are both stabilized, in which there’s a program for growth, and in which fiscal arrangements are clear—are made much clearer.  So there’s a lot of work to be done.  Again, we think that the policymakers in Europe have very strong incentives to get this right, and we’re very hopeful that they will get it right, and we are in close contact with them as they work on these issues.  But again, it is also important for us to be prepared for any further problems that might emerge from Europe, and we have been doing that.  For example, you know, we recently did our stress tests of the large bank holding companies to make sure they had enough capital even in the face of a severe financial crisis or a European crisis.  We have been monitoring the exposures of banks and other financial institutions to Europe and, of course, monitoring the situation there very closely.  So we are hoping for the best, we are hoping that European policymakers will take the additional steps they need to take to stabilize the situation.   17 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL But we are prepared, in case things get worse, to protect the U.S. economy and the U.S. financial system. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Greg Robb, MarketWatch.  I just wanted to get back to lending and credit.  The U.K. has started a program where the Bank of England is going to make lending to banks only if they lend to households and companies.  Is that something the Fed has under consideration?  Would that be something you’d start here?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we’re very interested in it, and we’re certainly going to follow it.  The details are not yet available.  And I think it should be noted that it’s not just a Bank of England program, but it’s joint with the British Treasury.  So the question—one question might be, how much of a fiscal component is there?  Is there some kind of fiscal subsidy being included there?  of programs that we look at. But we are looking for—as you know, throughout the crisis, we’ve looked for new programs, new ways to help the economy.  And this will be a type of thing that will be on the list 

[SECTION]

GREG IP.  Hi.  Greg Ip of the Economist.  You have an inflation target of 2 percent, but your projections show inflation centered below 2 percent over the medium term.  I was wondering if you could explain why.  And secondly, you said that the Fed is prepared to do more if necessary.  Could you briefly comment on what sort of form additional action might take?  And, specifically, what are the relative costs and benefits of doing more QE versus more maturity extension? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the—in terms of the inflation forecasts, again, I think it should be said, as a preliminary point, that economic projections have a lot of uncertainty  18 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL about them.  We talk about that uncertainty in the survey of economic projections.  So we shouldn’t take a false sense of precision from those numbers.  That being said, there is an issue about whether or not there’s sufficient stimulus in the economy.  As I mentioned earlier, one problem is that we are now at the zero bound, and that the types of unconventional programs that are available are—we know less about them, they have various costs and risks, and, for that reason, you may get a different amount of financial accommodation in this kind of regime than you would in one where short-term interest rates can be varied freely.  So I think that’s really a critical issue.  Now, in terms of the costs, I would list, briefly, large asset purchases increase the size of our balance sheet and therefore ultimately will make exit a more extended process.  Large asset purchases—which means that the Fed owns a larger share of a particular type of asset—may have implications for market functioning, which in turn might affect the ability of the Fed to have stimulative effects on the economy.  There are some financial stability issues that we are monitoring and that have to be taken into account.  So any kind of assessment of appropriate policy must look both at the outlook for the economy and for—and at the costs and risks associated with new measures, new steps that might be taken.  That being said, again, I think at this point, we still do have considerable scope to do more, and we are prepared to do more.  We’ll continue to monitor the economy and see how things evolve.  And if—again, we’re looking primarily at the labor market in this respect—if we’re not seeing a sustained improvement in the labor market, that would require additional action.    19 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL In terms of balance sheet actions, we are unlikely to do more maturity extension for a while because we have taken that about as far as we can.  So we would have to take other types of steps in order to add to the amount of stimulus in the economy. 

[SECTION]

TOSHIKI YAZAWA.  Thank you, Chairman.  I’m Toshiki Yazawa from Nikkei.  I hear a lot of conversations on liquidity trap in U.S.  That was a familiar concept in Japan after a bubble burst in the lost decades.  Is U.S. economy in liquidity trap?  And if that happens, how could economy escape from here?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the U.S. economy is in a situation where short-term interest rates are close to zero.  And so what that means is the Federal Reserve cannot add monetary accommodation by cutting short-term interest rates, the usual approach.  It’s been one of the themes of my own work for a long time, including some of the work I did on the Bank of Japan, that central banks are not out of tools once the short-term interest rate hits zero.  There are additional steps that can be taken.  And we have demonstrated through both communications techniques—guidance about future policy, which is something the Japanese have done as well, by the way—and through asset purchases, also something the Bank of Japan has done, that central banks do have some ability to provide financial accommodation to support their recovery even when short-term interest rates are close to zero.   That being said, as I mentioned to Mr. Ip, these nonstandard policies are less well understood, and they do have some costs and risks.  But I do think that, at the same time, that they can be effective in helping the economy. 

[SECTION]

JENNIFER LIBERTO.  Jennifer Liberto, CNNMoney.  Chairman, are you at all concerned that Operation Twist could affect banks’ earnings and their willingness to lend?  Does it undercut your ability to increase credit to consumers?  20 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Credit to consumers?  No, I don’t think so.  If—take, for example, I’ve heard the argument that by lowering interest rates, you make it unattractive to lend.  I don’t think that’s quite right.  What we’re lowering is the safe interest rate, the Treasury rate.  That should make it even more attractive for banks, rather than to hold securities, to look for borrowers and to earn the spread between the safe rate and what they can earn by lending to households and businesses.   So I think that macropolicy and monetary policy can, in fact, support lending.  Now, the question arises in some contexts whether there are other barriers to lending as exist, for example, in some parts of the mortgage market.  But lower interest rates on securities and other types of assets, all else equal, would induce banks to look for higher-yielding returns, higher-yielding assets in the form of loans to household and businesses. 

[SECTION]

MERRILL GOOZNER.  Merrill Goozner, the Fiscal Times.  Returning to Europe, briefly—some analysts have said that should the situation deteriorate there, the Fed could step in by buying European sovereign debt of various countries.  Are there any countries that you would rule out in such a strategy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The Federal Reserve isn’t going to be buying European sovereign debt, except we have a very limited amount of European sovereign debt as part of our foreign exchange reserves, and it comes primarily from a small number of countries.  So that’s not something that we would be engaged in.

CATHERINE HOLLANDER.  You have two new Fed Governors aboard.  Did that change the tenor of the discussion at all this week?  And did Jeremy Stein and Jay Powell push you in any particular policy direction?  21 of 22 June 20, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, they are two terrific people with great experience.  I’ve known Jeremy for a long time.  He’s an outstanding academic and knows a lot about finance.  Jay has both market experience and a lot of experience in government.  They both bring a lot to the table.  This was their first meeting, so I think, to some extent, they were in listening mode.  But they do have an awful lot to offer, and I really do look forward to working with them because I think that they are exceptional people.  And I’m glad, for the first time—I believe it’s the case that this is the first time that we had seven Governors at an FOMC meeting since 2005.  So it’s great to have a full complement of people, and it will help us do our other work as well as our monetary policy work more effectively.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  22 of 22",Ben Bernanke,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
6,2012-09-13,"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon.  Earlier today the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) approved new measures to support the recovery and employment growth.  I’ll get to the specifics of our actions in a few moments, but I’ll first describe the economic conditions that motivated the Committee’s decision to take additional actions.   As you know, the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy under a dual mandate from Congress to promote maximum employment and price stability.  The United States has enjoyed broad price stability since the mid-1990s and continues to do so today.  The employment situation, however, remains a grave concern.  While the economy appears to be on a path of moderate recovery, it isn’t growing fast enough to make significant progress reducing the unemployment rate.  Fewer than half of the 8 million jobs lost in the recession have been restored.  And, at 8.1 percent, the unemployment rate is nearly unchanged since the beginning of the year and is well above normal levels.   The weak job market should concern every American.  High unemployment imposes hardship on millions of people, and it entails a tremendous waste of human skills and talents.  Five million Americans have been unemployed for more than six months, and millions more have left the labor force—many of them doubtless because they have given up on finding suitable work.  As the skills of the long-term unemployed atrophy and as their connections to the labor market wither, they may find it increasingly difficult to get good jobs, to their and their families’ cost, of course, but also to the detriment of our nation’s productive potential. To help bolster the recovery and promote price stability, the FOMC has provided unprecedented levels of policy accommodation in recent years.  With our main policy interest 1 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL rate near its effective lower bound, we have been using two complementary tools to carry out monetary policy—balance sheet actions and forward guidance regarding how long we anticipate maintaining exceptional levels of policy accommodation.  While providing this support, we have been prudent, carefully weighing the potential benefits and costs of each new policy action, and recognizing that monetary policy, particularly in the current circumstances, cannot cure all economic ills.   The FOMC has taken several actions this year.  In January, it extended its forward guidance, stating that it anticipated that the federal funds rate will remain near current levels until late 2014.  In June, the Committee decided to continue through the end of the year the previously established program to extend the average maturity of the securities it holds by buying longer-term securities and selling an equivalent amount of shorter-term securities.  However, incoming data confirm that the modest pace of growth continues to be inadequate to generate much progress on unemployment.  With inflation anticipated to run at or below our 2 percent objective, the Committee has become convinced that further policy accommodation is warranted to strengthen the recovery and support the gains we have begun to see in housing and other sectors.   Accordingly, the FOMC decided today on new actions, electing to expand its purchases of securities and extend its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate.  Specifically, the Committee decided to purchase additional agency mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, at a pace of $40 billion per month.  The new MBS purchases—combined with the existing maturity extension program and the continued reinvestment of principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS already on our balance sheet—will result in an increase in our holdings of longer-term securities of about $85 billion each month for the remainder of the year.  The program of MBS purchases should increase the downward pressure on long-term interest rates more 2 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL generally, but also on mortgage rates, specifically, which should provide further support for the housing sector by encouraging home purchases and refinancing.   The Committee also took two steps to underscore its commitment to ongoing support for the recovery.  First, the Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months, and if we do not see substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, we will continue the MBS purchase program, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ our policy tools as appropriate until we do.  We will be looking for the sort of broad-based growth in jobs and economic activity that generally signal sustained improvement in labor market conditions and declining unemployment.  Of course, in determining the size, pace, and composition of any additional asset purchases, we will, as always, take appropriate account of the inflation outlook and of their efficacy and costs.   Additionally, the Committee emphasized that it expects a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy to remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.  This should provide greater assurance to households and businesses that policy accommodation will remain even as the economy picks up.  In particular, the Committee today kept the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and stated that it anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015. In conjunction with today’s meeting, FOMC participants—the 7 Board members and 12 Reserve Bank presidents—submitted their individual economic projections and policy assessments for the years 2012 through 2015 and over the longer run.  Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency of 8.0 to 8.2 percent, declining to 6.0 to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, levels that 3 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL remain somewhat above participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  Participants’ projections of inflation have a central tendency of 1.7 percent to 1.8 percent for this year and 1.8 percent to 2.0 percent for 2015. While the economy appears to be advancing at a moderate pace, with some improvements appearing in housing and elsewhere, FOMC participants see an economic outlook that remains uncertain.  The economy continues to face economic headwinds, including the situation in Europe; tight credit for some borrowers; and fiscal contraction at the federal, state, and local levels.  In addition, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks. Before I take your questions, I’d like to briefly address three concerns that have been raised about the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy.  The first is the notion that the Federal Reserve’s securities purchases are akin to fiscal spending.  The second is that a policy of very low rates hurts savers.  The third is that the Federal Reserve’s policies risk inflation down the road. On the first concern, I want to emphasize that the Fed’s purchases of longer-term securities are not comparable to government spending.  The Federal Reserve buys financial assets, not goods and services.  Ultimately, the Federal Reserve will normalize its balance sheet by selling these financial assets back into the market or by allowing them to mature.  In the interim, the Federal Reserve’s earnings from its holdings of securities are remitted to the Treasury.  In fact, the odds are strong that the Fed’s asset purchase programs, both through their net interest earnings and by strengthening the overall economy, will help reduce rather than increase the federal deficit and debt. 4 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL On the second concern, my colleagues and I are very much aware that holders of interest-bearing assets, such as certificates of deposit, are receiving very low returns.  But low interest rates also support the value of many other assets that Americans own, such as homes and businesses large and small.  Indeed, in general, healthy investment returns cannot be sustained in a weak economy, and, of course, it is difficult to save for retirement or other goals without the income from a job.  Thus, while low interest rates do impose some costs, Americans will ultimately benefit most from the healthy and growing economy that low interest rates help promote. And finally, on inflation:  Inflation has varied in recent years with swings in global food and fuel prices caused by a range of factors, such as drought and geopolitical tensions.  However, overall inflation has averaged very close to the Committee’s goal of 2 percent per year for quite a few years now, and a variety of measures show that longer-term inflation expectations are quite stable.  The Federal Reserve is fully committed to both sides of its mandate—to price stability as well as to maximum employment—and it has both the tools and the will to act at the appropriate time to avoid any emerging threat to price stability. Thank you.  I’d be happy to respond to your questions. 

[SECTION]

DARREN GERSH.  Hi, Mr. Chairman, it’s Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report.  Your forecast doesn’t get back to full employment for four years, so could these new bond purchases go on for years?  And can you give us a better idea of when you’ll—if you have specifics in mind on when you’ll know it’s time to stop? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  We’ll be looking for signs that the economy is strong enough to promote improvement and sustained improvement in labor market conditions and 5 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL we’re all the way back to full employment, that’s not the objective.  The idea is to quicken the recovery, to help the economy begin to grow quickly enough to generate new jobs and reduce the unemployment rate.  So that’s the criterion we’re looking at. 

[SECTION]

KRISTINA PETERSON.  Kristina Peterson of Dow Jones.  The statement indicated that the highly accommodative stance would be maintained until after the recovery starts to strengthen, but there aren’t any specific economic conditions that are described.  Could you describe what those would be?  Or is the Fed—the Fed seems reluctant to have done that so far. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we’ve been talking about our communications at the FOMC and trying to think about how best to communicate to the public, you know, what our policy reaction function, so to speak, is.  And we haven’t, to this point, come to a set of numbers, a set of data that we can put out.  But what we’re trying to convey here is that we’re not going to be premature in removing policy accommodation.  Even after the economy starts to recover more quickly, even after the unemployment rate begins to move down more decisively, we’re not going to rush to begin to tighten policy.  We’re going to give it some time to make sure the recovery is well established. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I want to talk about that same line in the statement.  Does that mean that your tolerance for inflation will be higher in coming years, in the middle of the recovery?  And, if not, what good is that language there if it doesn’t tell people that the reaction function relative to inflation has changed?  Secondly, stock prices are up today, so are oil prices and gold.  Why aren’t those part of the same reaction to the Fed’s acts today?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, our policy approach doesn’t involve intentionally trying to raise inflation.  That’s not the objective.  The idea is to make sure we provide enough support so the economy will grow fast enough to bring unemployment down over time.  I mean, 6 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL as we look back at the last six months or so, we’ve seen unemployment at basically the same place it was in January.  We’ve seen not enough jobs growth to bring down the unemployment rate, and what we need to see is more progress.  And that’s what we will be looking at.  In terms of the mid-2015 date, we think by that point that the economy will be recovering, we’ll be providing the support it needs.  But if you look at our projections, you’ll see it doesn’t involve any inflation, that we still believe that inflation is going to be close to our 2 percent target. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  All right, I just need to follow up.  Does this—so you’re saying it does not include greater tolerance for inflation, that you will—you would reverse course if inflation were to be above your target level, even given that statement? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, if inflation goes above the target level, as we talked about in our statement in January, we take a balanced approach.  We bring inflation back to the target over time, but we do it in a way that takes into account the deviations of both of our objectives, you know, from their targets.   

[SECTION]

ZACHARY GOLDFARB.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Earlier this year, on two occasions, the Fed took policy actions, which you defended as extremely important for the economy, but, as you mentioned, there hasn’t been any improvement in the labor markets since the beginning of the year.  Why should people believe this will make a difference?  And the projections seem to suggest it’s approximately a 0.4 reduction in unemployment.  Is that the limit of what Fed policies can do going forward?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, our assessment—I talked about this at my remarks at Jackson Hole—our assessment, and that of the research literature, is that the policies that we’ve undertaken have had real benefits for the economy—that they have provided some support, that they have eased financial conditions and help reduce unemployment.  All that being said, 7 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL monetary policy, as I’ve said many times, is not a panacea.  It’s not by itself able to solve these problems.  We’re looking for policymakers in other areas to do their part.  We’ll do our part, and we’ll try to make sure that unemployment moves in the right direction, but we can’t solve this problem by ourselves. projections is about what’s possible?   

[SECTION]

ZACHARY GOLDFARB.  And do you think that 0.4 percent difference in the 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, what happens is going to depend on where the economy goes—how much ultimate accommodation we give the economy.  The 0.4 percent you’re referring to is the change in the forecast between the last projection and this one.  But remember, people make projections assuming that policy is appropriate.  So some of them may have assumed these policies in their last projections, and not all are assuming these policies in this projection.  So that’s probably a little bit of an understatement of what we think we can get.  But in any case, again, I want to be clear that while I think we can make a meaningful and significant contribution to this problem—to reducing this problem, we can’t solve it.  We don’t have tools that are strong enough to solve the unemployment problem. 

[SECTION]

MIKE MCKEE.  You’ve made an eloquent explanation over the past couple of weeks of the Fed’s ability to lower interest rates.  But what’s missing for many economists is how the transmission mechanism is going to work.  Most people think this will have a minimal effect on rates.  Can you give us an idea of how much you think it might push rates down, and why moving rates down a few basis points might change demand, which seems to be the problem in the economy?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the ultimate effect is going to depend, of course, on how much we end up doing, and that, in turn, is going to depend on what the economy does.  8 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL This is a conditional program; we’re going to be providing accommodation according to how the economy evolves.  I think that’s the virtue of putting it this way, is that if the economy is weaker, we’ll provide more support; if the economy strengthens on its own or other headwinds die down, then it will require less support.  So the amount of support we provide is going to depend on how the economy evolves.  We do think that these policies can bring interest rates down—not just Treasury rates, but a whole range of rates, including mortgage rates and rates for corporate bonds and other types of important interest rates.  It also affects stock prices.  It affects other asset prices—home prices, for example.  So looking at all the different channels of effect, we think it does have impact on the economy.  It will have impact on the labor market, but, as again, the way I would describe it is a meaningful effect, a significant effect, but not a panacea, not a solution for the whole issue.  We’re just trying to get the economy moving in the right direction, to make sure that we don’t stagnate at high levels of unemployment, that we’re making progress towards more acceptable levels of unemployment.

ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times.  Mr. Chairman, is this the limit of what the Fed could do?  You refer in your statement to other policy tools.  If the unemployment situation doesn’t improve, then what other measures do you have available?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, there’s a variety of possibilities, and we continue to look at all different options.  But the two primary types of tools, as I’ve discussed, are balance sheet actions—and, of course, we can restructure those, change those in various ways; the other type of tool is communication tools.  And we could—we continue to work on how best to communicate with the public and how best to assure the public that the Fed will remain accommodative long enough to ensure recovery.  So, working with our communications tools, 9 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL clarifying our response to economic conditions, might be one way in which we could further provide accommodation. 

[SECTION]

PEDRO DA COSTA.  Pedro da Costa from Reuters.  My question is—I want to go back to the transmission mechanism because, speaking to people on the sidelines of the Jackson Hole conference, that seemed to be the concern about the remarks that you made is that they could clearly see the effect on rates and they could see the effect on the stock market, but they couldn’t see how that had helped the economy.  So I think there’s a fear that, over time, this has been a policy that’s helping Wall Street but not doing that much for Main Street.  So could you describe, in some detail, how does it really different—differ from trickle-down economics, where you just pump money into the banks and hope that they lend? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well we are—this is a Main Street policy, because what we’re about here is trying to get jobs going.  We are trying to create more employment, we are trying to meet our maximum employment mandate, so that’s the objective.  Our tools involve—I mean, the tools we have involve affecting financial asset prices, and that’s—those are the tools of monetary policy.  There are a number of different channels—mortgage rates, I mentioned other interest rates, corporate bond rates, but also the prices of various assets, like, for example, the prices of homes.  To the extent that home prices begin to rise, consumers will feel wealthier, they’ll feel more disposed to spend.  If house prices are rising, people may be more willing to buy homes because they think that they’ll, you know, make a better return on that purchase.  So house prices is one vehicle.  Stock prices—many people own stocks directly or indirectly.  The issue here is whether or not improving asset prices generally will make people more willing to spend.  One of the main concerns that firms have is there is not enough demand, there’s not enough people coming and demanding their products.  And if people feel that their financial 10 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL situation is better because their 401(k) looks better or for whatever reason, their house is worth more, they are more willing to go out and spend, and that’s going to provide the demand that firms need in order to be willing to hire and to invest. 

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Mr. Chairman, the statement says—we’ve come back to this a couple of times— “If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, … additional asset purchases, and employ … other policy tools.”  Can you define and describe more specifically what “improve substantially” means?  And what do you—what is the Committee referring to when it says “additional asset purchases” and “other … tools.”  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, we’re looking for ongoing sustained improvement in the labor market.  There’s not a specific number we have in mind.  But what we’ve seen in the last six months isn’t it.  We’re looking for something that involves unemployment coming down in a sustained way, not necessarily a rapid way, because I don’t know if our tools are that strong, but we’d like to see an economy which is strong enough that it will support improving labor market conditions and unemployment that’s declining gradually over time.  That’s essentially what we’re looking for.  In terms of the tools that we have, we have the mortgage-backed security purchases, which we can continue or expand or change in any—you know, in various ways.  We could also purchase, of course, Treasuries; we’ve retained that capacity.  And in terms of other policies, again, there are a number of possibilities, but the one I mentioned to Zach in particular is our communication policies, finding ways to better explain our rate policies that will engender more-accommodative financial conditions. 11 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Mr. Chairman, it seems pretty clear that the Fed’s announcement today has created a good deal of confusion about how long you’ll keep buying assets, judging from the questions in this room and outside of it.  Why did you choose not to adopt a specific target?  Did the Committee consider specific targets—there have been a number of proposals—and why did you choose not to do that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we—the problem is that, for this purpose, that what we’re looking for is a general improvement in labor market conditions.  We want to see the unemployment rate come down, but that’s not the only indicator, obviously, of labor market conditions.  The unemployment rate came down last month because participation fell.  That’s not necessarily a sign of improvement.  So we want to see more jobs.  We want to see lower unemployment.  We want to see a stronger economy that can cause the improvement to be sustained; it’s not just a one-month or two-month phenomenon.  We’re not going to be looking for little wiggles in the numbers that are going to cause us to radically shift our policy.  So, we, at least at this point, have decided to define it qualitatively.  I hope I am giving you at least a little color in terms of what we’ll be looking for.  We’ll be looking for, again, an economy which is quickening, that gives signs of continued improvement, that allows labor markets to be stronger, and that will be the type of qualitative criteria that we look at.  We don’t—again, we don’t have a single number that captures that, but we anticipate that we’ll have to do more, and we’ll do enough to make sure that the economy gets on the right track. 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Someone told me that less than 1 percent of all mortgages originated in the past 18 months went to borrowers with impaired credit history.  So when we talk about people and a Main Street policy, it seems like you’re struggling, like many other central banks, and that’s to get the low rates down to—the challenge is to get them to 12 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL people who really need them, people who are paying high rates or companies with somewhat fragile balance sheets.  So, given that’s the case—I mean, you guys got involved in markets when they were dysfunctional in the crisis.  What’s your appetite for doing more-targeted credit programs if, post-election, you had a Treasury Secretary and a Congress that was willing to underwrite some of the credit risk? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, now you’re talking about congressional programs, and I don’t, you know, I don’t advocate specific programs.  It’s up to them to make those helping is a stronger housing market.  One reason that lenders have been very constrained is they are worried about further house price declines that will make the collateral worth less than the loan.  As house prices have begun to rise, as the economy has gotten a little stronger, lending standards have eased just a bit.  There’s also been other changes which are useful.  I note, for example, that the FHFA and the GSEs have recently changed their policy on putbacks so that banks will have more certainty about under what conditions a mortgage will be put back to them if it defaults.  So I think there’s number of things in train that will make the mortgage markets a little bit more open, and that is one factor, actually, that could make our policy more effective rather than less effective over time—if more people have access to mortgage credit, more people can take advantage of the low rates that we’re providing. 

[SECTION]

GREG IP.  Greg Ip of the Economist.  Mr. Chairman, one of the innovations of your statement today is that you have for the first time explicitly predicated your monetary policy action on the achievement of explicit economic goals, in this case a substantial improvement in the labor market.  Could you give us some explanation of how that conditioning will make your policy more effective than if you had simply done as you previously have:  announced the policy 13 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL and then conducted it?  And a technical question:  When “Operation Twist” ends, do you anticipate adjusting the size of your asset purchases in order to maintain the $85 billion monthly flow of long-term asset purchases? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  On the latter, when Operation Twist ends, we will be looking at the whole set of asset purchases in order to make decisions.  We’ll be looking at the state of the economy, as we described in the statement.  In particular, what’s the state of the labor always been conditional in that we’ve always been clear that our asset purchases, for example, were reviewed periodically to see if they were still necessary, if they needed to be expanded.  We did extend the maturity extension program, for example, when we thought that more support was needed for the economy, so our policies have always had a significant element of conditionality.  But the idea here is to make that more explicit, more transparent to the public, make it more obvious that the Fed will do what’s needed to provide the support for the economy.  And we hope that what that will do is provide a bit more assurance, maybe a bit more confidence, that the Fed will be there to do what it can.  Again, we’re not promising, you know, a cure to all these ills.  But what we can do is provide some support, and by assuring the public that we will be prepared to take action if the economy falters, we’re hopeful that that will increase confidence and make people more willing to invest, hire, and spend. 

[SECTION]

PETER BARNES.  Sir, just to follow up on—Peter Barnes with Fox Business—to follow up on Darren’s questions, a question about getting back to full employment.  It looks like there’s a lot more work to do here.  And so I wanted to ask you about your plans as Fed Chairman—your term expires in January of 2014.  Governor Romney’s comments notwithstanding, what are your plans?  Do you plan to leave at that time?  Would you consider an appointment to a third 14 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL term at the Fed at all?  And then, if I may, on election year politics, is there any—do you have any concern or was there any discussion within the Committee about whether or not your actions today might be perceived as helping President Obama, helping the economy, and thus helping President Obama get reelected and hurting Governor Romney’s chances in the presidential contest?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, on the former, I’m—I have a lot to do.  I am very focused on my work, and I don’t have any decision or any information to give you on my personal plans.  On the politics, we have tried very, very hard—and I think we’ve been successful—at the Federal Reserve to be nonpartisan and apolitical.  We make our decisions based entirely on the state of the economy and the needs of the economy for policy accommodation.  So we just don’t take those factors into account, and we think that’s the best way to maintain our independence and maintain the trust of the public. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Chairman, Donna Borak with American Banker.  My question pertains to Basel III.  Community bankers, as you know, have been very worried about the impact that these rules will have on their banks, especially given the fact that there’s been some industry consolidation, and some have even questioned whether or not the Fed has actually looked at the impact that the rules would have on smaller-sized institutions.  So my question for you is, will there be relief for the smaller institutions, and can you provide any assurance that this will not be a one-size-fits-all regulation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Certainly.  We are very interested in and very focused on community banks at the Fed.  We believe they play a very important role in our economy and in our communities.  We have a number of ways of communicating with community banks.  It includes our advisory council made up of community bankers.  It includes a special set of 15 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL programs we have to reach out and talk to community bankers.  So we are very interested in their views.  I speak regularly to conventions and the like and talk to various groups.  In terms of Basel III, of course, it’s not one-size-fits-all.  Many—and, indeed, many of the most difficult, complex regulations apply only to the largest and most complex institutions—for example, the capital surcharge that the largest banks have to hold, the complex rules applying to trading books and derivatives, the extra supervision under section 165, the orderly liquidation authority, the liquidity rules—the whole range of things that apply only to the largest, most complex, and internationally active banks.  For the smaller banks, what our proposed rule does is try to strengthen their capital, and many small banks will already meet those capital requirements.  Smalls banks tend to be very well capitalized.  But, of course, it’s important for small banks to be well capitalized as well as large banks.  And there’s a leverage requirement.  But, again, most of the rules, most of the—particularly the most complex rules in Basel III will not apply to the smaller banks.  Indeed, banks under $500 million have special exemptions from these rules.  Having said all of that, I remind you that what we have now is a proposed rule, and we’re receiving comment on that.  We have a subcommittee of our supervision committee with two experienced—one community banker, one community bank supervisor on it from our Board who are particularly interested in making sure that the rules are not excessively onerous, and we will be looking at the comments and trying to make sure that we take into account the needs of community banks when we put out the final rule. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Yesterday former Fed Governor Larry Meyer at a conference in Washington said he’d never seen such a divided Fed.  And we see it, we who cover the Fed see it in the speeches, in the run-up to today’s decision.  Some people said that it was dubious whether QE3 would work.  Could you comment on former Governor Meyer’s 16 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL suggestions, and then—and sometimes don’t you think, don’t you wish that some of the Fed officials who don’t support QE would keep their—keep their fears to themselves?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as you know, we are living in a very complex time and dealing with a complex economic situation and a variety of novel and different issues, including new policies that haven’t been used in the same way in the past, and so naturally we have a range of views, a range of opinions.  I think on the whole that’s probably a good thing.  It’s good to hear different points of view, and it’s good to make sure that the points of view that are outside the Fed are reflected in the discussion around the table inside the Fed.  So we have a very collaborative and collegial discussion process, that, again—that spans a range of views.  We were, however, able to come to a pretty good consensus—as you know, the vote on this was 11 to 1—and that’s a sign that the broad center of the Committee does support these actions and will continue to support them going forward. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Does the negative commentary hurt QE?  Could it, if people in the 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  There’s going to be negative commentary whether it comes from Fed officials or not.  Again, because there’s a range of views—some people think it’s more effective than others.  I discussed some of the evidence in my speech in Jackson Hole, and I talked about the fact that, you know, different researchers have gotten different estimates of the impact.  Virtually all of them find that there is some beneficial impact, but they disagree on how much.  So, there’s going to be disagreement.  And again, I personally don’t think that it’s a panacea, I personally don’t think it’s going to solve the problem.  But I do think it has enough force to help nudge the economy in the right direction. 17 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE FLEURY.  You said that you can’t cure all ills, that you haven’t got strong enough tools to deal with the unemployment problem.  I was curious to know what policy actions you’d like to see outside the Fed to try and address this.  And, secondly, also on the “fiscal cliff,” the expected spending cuts and tax increases, how concerned are you about that?  And what ammunition do you have to deal with that, if that becomes a problem? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well there’s, again, a range of areas where actions could be taken, and I can’t really prescribe all those possible responses.  I would focus, I think, on the fiscal side.  We currently have the so-called fiscal cliff.  If no action is taken, there’s going to be a very substantial increase in taxes and cut in spending on January 1 of the coming year.  The CBO has suggested that if that’s allowed to take place, that it would cause unemployment to begin to rise, and it might throw the economy back into recession.  So I think one very basic thing that could be done to help address the recovery—the weakness of the recovery and the need for more employment—would be to address the fiscal cliff while simultaneously addressing longer-term fiscal sustainability issues which remain, of course, very serious.  So that’s one area where there is a lot of potential benefit.  If the fiscal cliff isn’t addressed, as I’ve said, I don’t think our tools are strong enough to offset the effects of a major fiscal shock, so we’d have to think about what to do in that contingency.  So I think it’s really important for the fiscal policymakers to, you know, work together and try to find a solution for that. 

[SECTION]

PATRICK WELTER.  Mr. Chairman, my name is Patrick Welter with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.  I have two questions, if I may.  One is in the projections.  In the economic and inflation projections, you foresee a low inflation rate below 2 percent to 2015—not you personally, but the FOMC.  I am wondering, if you look at the growth rates, you have growth rates of about 3.4 percentage points in 2014 and 2015.  How long 18 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL do you think that it might work that you have such strong growth and no inflation pressure?  And the second question, if I may, is, a lot of economists don’t see too much effect out of the further round of QE3.  Aren’t you worried that, in promising that you will do whatever you can, even if it is tiny, small, that you give some kind of carte blanche to the fiscal policy and to the Congress not to do enough on their side of the policy action? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the—on inflation, we do anticipate at some point what’s normal in a recovery, which is, given that the economy fell very quickly and there’s a lot of unused capacity, there’s a lot of slack in the economy, it would be normal that there would be a period where the economy would grow faster than trend in order to make up some of the slack that was created.  So we don’t anticipate the economy is going to be overheating anytime soon.  And as long as we pay close attention to inflation expectations as well as the trajectory of the economy, we think inflation will remain close to our 2 percent target.  On your second question, certainly, there is a range of views on how effective these tools are.  I’ve spent a lot of time, as all of my colleagues have, looking at the evidence, and, of course, the staff here have done a great deal of work on the question.  And the bottom line for most of it, most of the research, is that while these tools are not so powerful that they can solve the problem, they are at least able to provide meaningful support to the economy.  Our job is to use the tools we have to meet our mandate, which is maximum employment and price stability.  So if we have tools that we think can provide some assistance and we’re not meeting our mandate, then I think that our obligation is to do what we can.  Of course, we would like to see policies across the board to help address these issues.  But, you know, that’s not our province; we are the monetary policy authorities, and our job is to use monetary policy as effectively as we can. 19 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

STEVE BECKNER.  Steve Beckner of MNI, Mr. Chairman.  There have been concerns raised, questions raised by people like Columbia Professor Michael Woodford and others about the credibility of your forward guidance on the path, the future path of the federal funds rate—the idea being that, to the extent it’s conditional, it’s not really convincing and doesn’t provide the kind of confidence that you referred to.  Now, on this latest statement, you’ve removed some of that conditionality.  I am particularly struck by the statement that “the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.”  I assume that was done to make your forward guidance more credible, and yet the question remains whether, you know, as the economy picks up steam, whether the FOMC will really follow through and keep rates low or whether you will do as the Fed has always done and begin to raise the funds rate. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, that’s an important question.  Michael Woodford— who, by the way, is my former colleague and coauthor and friend, so I know him quite well, and I know his works quite well—I think, actually, the thrust of his research is that forward guidance—communication about future policy—is, in fact, the most powerful tool that central banks have when the interest rate is close to zero.  And he advocates policies like nominal GDP targeting, for example, that would essentially require credibility lasting many years, the implication being that the Fed would target the nominal level of GDP and promise to do that for many years in the future even if inflation, you know, rose as part of that policy.  So his own perspective is that credibility is the key tool that central banks have in order to get traction at the zero lower bound.  Whether we have the credibility to persuade markets that we’ll follow through is an empirical question.  And the evidence, which I also, again, discussed in my remarks recently, is that when we’ve announced extended guidance, that financial markets have 20 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL responded to that, that private-sector forecasters have changed their estimates of what unemployment and inflation will be when the Fed begins to remove accommodation.  So the empirical evidence is that our announcements do have considerable credibility.  And I think there’s a good reason for that, which is that we have talked a lot both publicly and privately about the rationale for maintaining rates low even as the economy strengthens, and I think the basic ideas are broadly espoused within the Committee.  And so there is a consensus that even as the personnel change and so on going forward, that this is the appropriate approach, and that by following through, we will have created a reserve of credibility that we can use in any subsequent episodes that occur. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times.  With mortgage rates already at historical lows, how much further do you think the actions, your actions, will drive down the rates, and related to that, I’m assuming that you expect the purchases of mortgage-backed securities to have a meaningful effect on refinancings and housing activity.  What would that look like?  What would that meaningful effect mean? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, as I mentioned before, it’s true that our mortgage-backed securities purchases ought to drive down mortgage rates, and put downward pressure on mortgage rates, and create more demand for homes and more refinancing.  But it will depend, again, ultimately on several things.  One will be on the amount that we do, the amount of purchases that we do, and that in turn is going to be a function of how the economy evolves.  If the economy is weaker, we’ll do more, and in those cases, probably rates would be pretty low at any case because the economy is looking weak.  If the economy is stronger, strong enough to create improving labor market conditions, we won’t have to do as much.  And so, the amount that we do depends on how the economy evolves.  So, since I don’t know exactly how much 21 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL we’ll end up doing, it’s a little bit hard to give you an exact estimate.  So I think that’s, you know, in terms of how many homes and those kinds of questions, again, I think that the markets are looking—are looking a little better.  I think that house prices are beginning to rise in some mortgage loans.  So I’m hopeful that we’ll see continued progress in the housing market; that—that has been one of the missing pistons in the engine here.  Housing is usually a big part of the recovery process.  We haven’t had that nearly to the usual extent, and to the extent that we can support housing, I think that would be a very useful outcome. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  There doesn’t seem to be that many people who could qualify for refinancings.  Can we expect a meaningful effect on an increase in refinancing activity? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think there’ll be some, but you get more benefit when people buy homes.  And sales of homes are down still, but they have been rising steadily, and we’re trying to provide more support for people who want to go out and buy homes, construct homes, and also those who want to refinance.  But it’s the purchases of new homes that generate the construction activity, the furnishing, all those things that help the economy grow.   

[SECTION]

SCOTT SPOERRY.  Scott Spoerry with CNN and CNNMoney.  Earlier this year at one of your news conferences in this room, you said that you were already hearing anecdotal information from some of your colleagues at the regional Fed Banks about firms, companies making decisions on hiring next year because they were afraid of the fiscal cliff or whatever the federal government was going to do in terms of—in terms of cutbacks.  It’s been a few months since you made that statement, and I’m sure your staff are working hard on it, but how much of a headwind to the economy is the fear of the federal government just sort of cutting way back, falling across the fiscal cliff or even—even if they take a few steps back from the cliff, it’s still 22 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL there.  How much is that fear contributing to lack of—lack of growth or adequate GDP growth in the economy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well I—you know, it’s pretty hard to give you a number, but I can certainly confirm that as the Reserve Bank presidents and Governors made their reports today and yesterday around the table, there was considerable discussion of uncertainty, including policy uncertainty, fiscal policy uncertainty, and the implications of that for hiring and investment decisions.  A lot of—a lot of firms are waiting to see whether that problem will be resolved.  And if so, how?  And I think it is a concern.  It is something that is affecting behavior now.  But again, I don’t know—I don’t have a number, I don’t know how big that effect is, but, certainly, the sooner that can be resolved, the sooner it can be clarified, it will be beneficial not just because we avoid the cliff itself, but because we clarify for firms, for employers and investors, how that’s going to be resolved.  So, I think it’s an issue that is of some consequence, yes. 

[SECTION]

CATHERINE HOLLANDER.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Catherine Hollander, National Journal.  How much was the fiscal cliff a decision, or a factor in your decision, to do an open-ended QE instead of a fixed sum?  Or fiscal uncertainty more generally? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we take the economy as we find it.  There are a lot of headwinds right now that are affecting the economy.  There’s fiscal headwinds.  There’s international factors, including the situation in Europe.  There’s factors arising from still-impaired credit markets, and so on.  So we looked at that—looked at the economy from the perspective of, you know, how quickly it’s been growing over the last six months to a year.  And, as I talked about in a speech in March, in order for employment gains to be sustained, for unemployment to fall, the economy needs to grow at or above trend levels.  And lately it’s not 23 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL really been at trend.  So we’ve been responding to that problem and trying to take steps that will assure somewhat stronger growth and, we hope, will help bring unemployment down over time.  Now, again, the fiscal cliff, the uncertainty about the fiscal cliff, is one of the factors, one of the headwinds, but I’m sure there are many others, and we don’t try to differentiate among them in any sense.  If the fiscal cliff does occur, I suspect it won’t, and I hope it won’t, but if it does, and we get the kind of impact the Congressional Budget Office is talking about, as I’ve said, I don’t think the Federal Reserve has the tools to offset that, and we would have to rethink at that point.  But we’ve taken the steps we’ve taken now because we’d like to see the economy gather more momentum, and the more momentum it has, the better placed we are to deal with any shocks that might come down the road. we’ve seen in recent reports on unemployment is the shrinking labor force.  Is that something that’s of specific concern to you, and what does it tell us about the labor market and the economy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, you are absolutely right.  And as I mentioned earlier, the unemployment decline last month was more than 100 percent accounted for by declines in participation.  Some decline in participation is anticipated, is as expected.  We’re an aging society.  We have more people retiring.  Female participation has flattened out; it hasn’t continued to climb as it did for several decades.  We’re seeing less participation among younger people, fewer college students taking part-time jobs and the like.  So part of this decline in participation was something that we anticipated quite a long time ago, but part of it is cyclical.  Part of it reflects the fact that some people—because they have essentially given up or at least are very discouraged—have decided to leave the labor force.  And the anticipation is that if the 24 of 25 September 13, 2012   Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL economy really were to strengthen, and labor markets were to strengthen, at least some of those people would come back into the labor force.  They might even temporarily raise the unemployment rate because they’re now looking again.  So the participation rate over and above—the decline in participation rate over and above the downward trend is just one of the other indicators of a generally weak labor market.  And it’s why I said earlier that we do want to look at a range of indicators, not just the unemployment rate, although that’s a very important indicator, not just payrolls, although that also is a leading indicator, but participation, hours, part-time work, and a variety of other measures which suggest that our labor market is still in quite weak condition. Thank you. 25 of 25",Ben Bernanke,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
7,2012-12-12,"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon. It’s been about three and a half years since the economic recovery began.  The economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Unfortunately, however, unemployment remains high.  About 5 million people—more than 40 percent of the unemployed—have been without a job for six months or more, and millions more who say they would like full-time work have been able to find only part-time employment or have stopped looking entirely.  The conditions now prevailing in the job market represent an enormous waste of human and economic potential.  A return to broad-based prosperity will require sustained improvement in the job market, which in turn requires stronger economic growth.  Meanwhile, apart from some temporary fluctuations that largely reflected swings in energy prices, inflation has remained tame and appears likely to run at or below the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) 2 percent objective in coming quarters and over the longer term. Against a macroeconomic backdrop that includes both high unemployment and subdued inflation, the FOMC will maintain its highly accommodative policy.  Today the Committee took several steps.  First, it decided to continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), initiated at the September meeting, at a pace of $40 billion per month.  Second, the Committee decided to purchase longer-term Treasury securities, initially at a pace of $45 billion per month, after its current program to extend the average maturity of its holdings is completed at the end of the year.  In continuing its asset purchases, the Committee seeks to maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and to keep financial conditions accommodative, thereby promoting hiring and economic growth while ensuring that inflation 1 of 34   December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL   over time is close to our 2 percent objective.  Finally, the Committee today also modified its guidance about future rate policy to provide more information to the public about how it anticipates it will react to evolving economic conditions.  I will return to this change in our communication after discussing our decision to continue asset purchases. Although the Committee’s announcement today specified the initial monthly pace and composition of asset purchases, it did not give specific dates at which the program may be modified or ended.  Instead, the pattern of future asset purchases will depend on the Committee’s evaluation of incoming information, in two respects. First, we expect to continue asset purchases until we see a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, in a context of price stability.  In assessing the extent of progress, the Committee will be evaluating a range of labor market indicators, including the unemployment rate, payroll employment, hours worked, and labor force participation, among others.  Because increases in demand and production are normally precursors to improvements in labor market conditions, we will also be looking carefully at the pace of economic activity more broadly.   Second, the Committee will be monitoring economic and financial developments to assess both the efficacy and possible drawbacks of its asset purchase program.  The Federal Reserve’s asset purchases over the past few years have provided important support to the economy, for example, by helping to keep mortgage rates historically low.  The Committee expects this policy tool to continue to be effective and the costs and risks to remain manageable, but as the program continues, we will be regularly updating those assessments.  If future evidence suggests that the program’s effectiveness has declined, or if potential unintended side effects or risks become apparent as the balance sheet grows, we will modify the program as  2 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  appropriate.  More generally, the Committee intends to be flexible in varying the pace of securities purchases in response to information bearing on the outlook or on the perceived  benefits and costs of the program.  Unlike the explicitly quantitative criteria associated with the Committee’s forward guidance about the federal funds rate, which I will discuss in a moment, the criteria the Committee will use to make decisions about the pace and extent of its asset purchase program are qualitative; in particular, continuation of asset purchases is tied to our seeing substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.  Because we expect to learn more over time about the efficacy and potential costs of asset purchases in the current economic context, we believe that qualitative guidance is more appropriate at this time.  In today’s statement, the Committee also recast its forward guidance to clarify how it expects its target for the federal funds rate to depend on future economic developments.  Specifically, the Committee anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted “at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation over the period between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than half a percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.”  This formulation is a change from earlier statements in which forward guidance about the federal funds rate was expressed in terms of a date; for example, in the statements following its September and October meetings, the Committee indicated that it anticipated that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted “at least through mid-2015.”  The modified formulation makes more explicit the FOMC’s intention to maintain accommodation as long as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price stability, a strategy that we believe will help support  3 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  household and business confidence and spending.  By tying future monetary policy more explicitly to economic conditions, this formulation of our policy guidance should also make  monetary policy more transparent and predictable to the public. The change in the form of the Committee’s forward guidance does not in itself imply any change in the Committee’s expectations about the likely future path of the federal funds rate since the October meeting.  In particular, the Committee expects that the stated threshold for unemployment will not be reached before mid-2015 and projects that inflation will remain close to 2 percent over that period.  Thus, given the Committee’s current outlook, the guidance introduced today is consistent with the Committee’s earlier statements that “exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015.”   Let me emphasize that the 6½ percent threshold for the unemployment rate should not be interpreted as the Committee’s longer-term objective for unemployment.  Indeed, in the economic projections submitted in conjunction with today’s meeting, the central tendency of participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment is 5.2 to 6.0 percent.  However, because changes in monetary policy affect the economy with a lag, the Committee believes that it likely will need to begin moving away from a highly accommodative policy stance before the economy reaches maximum employment.  Waiting until maximum employment is achieved before beginning the process of removing policy accommodation could lead to an undesirable overshooting of potential output and compromise the FOMC’s longer-term inflation objective of 2 percent.  As the FOMC statement makes clear, the Committee anticipates that policy under the new guidance will be fully consistent with continued progress against unemployment and with inflation remaining close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the longer term.  4 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  Although the modified guidance should provide greater clarity about how the Committee expects to respond to incoming data, it by no means puts monetary policy on autopilot.  In this regard, let me make several points. First, as the statement notes, the Committee views its current low-rate policy as likely to be appropriate at least until the specified thresholds are met.  Reaching one of those thresholds, however, will not automatically trigger immediate reduction in policy accommodation.  For example, if unemployment were to decline to slightly below 6½ percent at a time when inflation and inflation expectations were subdued and were projected to remain so, the Committee might judge an immediate increase in its target for the federal funds rate to be inappropriate.  Ultimately, in deciding when and how quickly to reduce policy accommodation, the Committee will follow a balanced approach in seeking to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run 2 percent goal and deviations of employment from its estimated maximum level.   Second, the Committee recognizes that no single indicator provides a complete assessment of the state of the labor market and therefore will consider changes in the unemployment rate within the broader context of labor market conditions.  For example, in evaluating a given decline in the unemployment rate, the Committee will also take into account the extent to which that decline was associated with increases in employment and hours worked, as opposed to, say, increases in the number of discouraged workers and falling labor force participation.  The Committee will also consider whether the improvement in the unemployment rate appears sustainable. Third, the Committee chose to express the inflation threshold in terms of projected inflation between one and two years ahead, rather than in terms of current inflation.  The Committee took this approach to make clear that it intends to look through purely transitory 5 of 34   December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  fluctuations in inflation, such as those induced by short-term variations in the prices of  internationally traded commodities, and to focus instead on the underlying inflation trend.  In making its collective judgment about the underlying inflation trend, the Committee will consider a variety of indicators, including measures such as median, trimmed mean, and core inflation; the views of outside forecasters; and the predictions of econometric and statistical models of inflation.  Also, the Committee will pay close attention to measures of inflation expectations to ensure that those expectations remain well anchored. Finally, the Committee will continue to monitor a wide range of information on economic and financial developments to ensure that policy is conducted in a manner consistent with our dual mandate.   It’s worth noting that the goals of the FOMC’s asset purchases and of its federal funds rate guidance are somewhat different.  The goal of the asset purchase program is to increase the near-term momentum of the economy by fostering more-accommodative financial conditions, while the purpose of the rate guidance is to provide information about the future circumstances under which the Committee would contemplate reducing accommodation.  I would emphasize that a decision by the Committee to end asset purchases, whenever that point is reached, would not be a turn to tighter policy.  While in that circumstance the Committee would no longer be increasing policy accommodation, its policy stance would remain highly supportive of growth.  Only at some later point would the Committee begin actually removing accommodation through rate increases.  Moreover, as I have discussed today, the decisions to modify the asset purchase program and to undertake rate increases are tied to different criteria. In conclusion, the FOMC’s actions today are part of our ongoing efforts to support economic recovery and job creation while maintaining price stability.  As I have often stressed,  6 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  however, monetary policy has its limits; only the private and public sectors working together can get the U.S. economy fully back on track.  In particular, it will be critical that fiscal policymakers  come together soon to achieve longer-term fiscal sustainability without adopting policies that could derail the ongoing recovery. Thank you.  I would be happy to answer your questions. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman from CNBC.  I guess I have a lot of questions but I’ll just offer up two here.  Why are there different targets for QE and for the funds rate?  What does that achieve?  Secondly, what good is a target if you have to make reference to calendar dates in the statement itself, which is the thing you got away from.  You had to point out in the statement that it’s not substantially different from the calendar dates we set back in thirdly, I guess I know I said two— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I’m going to forget. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  But then you have another paragraph after that that says it’s not just target it’s something else.  So, it’s unclear to me what good these targets are if you have to reference a calendar date, and then you kind of say in the next paragraph it’s not really targets. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, so first, the—as I said—the asset purchases and the rate increases have different objectives.  The asset purchases are about creating some near-term momentum in the economy, trying to strengthen growth and job creation in the near term, and the increases in the federal funds rate target, when they ultimately occur, are about reducing accommodation.  Two very different objectives.  Secondly, the asset purchases are a less well-understood tool.  We have—we’ll be learning over time about how efficacious they are, about what costs they may carry with them in terms of unintended consequences that they might  7 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  create, and we’ll be seeing how—what else happens in the economy that can affect, you know, the level of unemployment, for example, that we hope to achieve.  And so, for that reason, as I discussed in my opening remarks, we decided to make the criteria for asset purchases qualitative  at this time because we have a number of different things that we need to look at as we go forward.  Rate increases, by contrast, are well understood, and we understand the relationship between those rate increases and the state of the economy.  And so we’ve been able to give somewhat more quantitative, more specific guidance in that respect.  With respect to the date, in the transition today, we wanted to make clear that the change in guidance did not—it happens to be the case that it doesn’t change our mid-2015 expectation.  Going forward, we’ll drop the date and rely on the conditionality, and that has, I think, a very important advantage which is that if news comes in that the economy is stronger or weaker, then financial markets and the public will be able to adjust their expectations for when policy tightening will occur without the Committee having to go through a process of changing its date in a nontransparent way, so I think that’s beneficial.  Does that cover your—okay. at this particular time to specify targets?  And, by taking an unemployment rate that is quite low compared to currently, does that shift the balance of priorities in terms of your dual mandate, closer more in the direction of reducing unemployment rather than inflationary pressures? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s a very good question.  We took the change today after a good bit of discussion.  We had a very substantial discussion of the threshold approach at our last meeting.  And we felt it was ready to go, ready to put out.  We—while there are different views on aspects of the threshold approach, there was a lot of agreement that having a more explicit connection between rate policy and the state of the economy was more transparent and  8 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  more helpful to the markets and to the public than our date-based guidance, and therefore, there was a general view that, at some point at least, that we should switch to that kind of guidance.   So we do hope that it’ll be more helpful and give markets more information about how we’re going to respond going forward.  It is not a change in our relative balance, weights, towards inflation and unemployment—by no means.  First of all, with respect to inflation, we remain completely committed to our 2 percent longer-run objective.  Moreover, we expect our forecast, as you can see from the Summary of Economic Projections; our forecasts are that inflation will actually remain, despite this threshold of 2½, that inflation will actually remain at or below 2 percent going forward.  And so—and finally, the thresholds that we have put out are entirely consistent with our long-standing views on what the rate path has to be, what the path of interest rates has to be, in order to achieve improvement in the labor market while keeping inflation close to target.  So we—I think both sides of the mandate are well-served here.  There is no real change in policy.  What it is instead is an attempt to clarify the relationship between policy and economic conditions. the more important now that you’ve specified these targets, is it difficult to put forward these projections now given the uncertainty over the fiscal cliff?  How sort of plastic are these? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are you talking about the SEP projections? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, clearly the fiscal cliff is having effects on the economy.  Even though we’ve not yet even reached the point of the fiscal cliff potentially kicking in, it’s already affecting business investment and hiring decisions by creating uncertainty or creating pessimism.  We saw what happened recently to consumer sentiment, which fell,  9 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  presumably in part because of concerns about the fiscal cliff.  So, clearly, this is a major risk  factor and a major source of uncertainty about the economy going forward.  I would suspect and, although the participants don’t all make this explicit, but I would suspect that what they are assuming in their projections is that the fiscal cliff gets resolved in some intermediate way, whereby there is still some fiscal drag but not as much as implied by the entire fiscal cliff.  So I think that’s probably the underlying assumption that most people took when they made their projections.  But as you—you’re absolutely right that there is a lot of uncertainty right now and if the fiscal cliff situation turns out to be resolved in a way very different from our expectations, I’m sure you would see changes in the forecast.

ALISTER BULL.  Alister Bull from Reuters.  Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman.  Could you talk about whether the decision to maintain the monthly bond purchases at 85 billion a month represents a ramping up or additional easing to Fed policy, because you’re now going to be adding a little bit more to the size of balance sheet?  And also, you know, you’ve talked about maintaining the asset purchases until you see a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, and you’ve said that you want to take a qualitative approach, but you’ve also got this 6½ percent inflation threshold out there as well.  So, could you talk about what sort of evidence you’d see to sort of make you change the pace or slow the pace of purchases? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The first part of your question was? 

[SECTION]

ALISTER BULL.  Is this an additional stimulus or are you— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, I think this is really a continuation of what we said in that unless we saw substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market that we would  10 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  undertake additional asset purchases or other actions.  And that’s what we’ve done today is  simply follow through on what we said we would do in September.  I don’t think that we have, relative to last month, I don’t think we have significantly added to accommodation.  The reason is that, at least in my view and I think many of my colleagues’, that what matters primarily is the mix of assets on the balance sheet, on the asset side of the balance sheet.  So what’s important is the fact that we’re acquiring Treasury securities and MBS, taking those out of the market, you know, forcing investors into other closely related assets and that’s where the stimulus comes from, not so much in the size of the balance sheet per se.  So, in my judgment, the amount of stimulus is more or less the same, it’s just being continued.  It’s a follow-through from what we saw in September.  In terms of criteria, again, what we’ve done is we’ve announced an initial amount of 85 billion a month of purchases.  We are prepared to vary that as new information comes in.  For example, if the economy’s outlook gets noticeably stronger, we would presumably begin to ramp down the level of purchases.  But again, the problem with giving a specific number is that there are multiple criteria on which we make this decision.  We’ll be looking at the outlook for labor market, which is very important, but we’ll also be looking at other factors that may be affecting the outlook for the economy.  For example, I hope it won’t happen but if the fiscal cliff occurs, as I’ve said many times, I don’t think the Federal Reserve has the tools to offset that event and, in that case, we obviously have to temper our expectations about what we can accomplish.  Likewise, as I said, we’ll also be looking at the efficacy and costs of our program and if, you know, we find, we expect it to be efficacious but if we find that it’s not working as well as we hoped or if the various costs are emerging that we had not anticipated then that would also have to be taken into account as we think about it.  So, we thought it was not constructive because we ourselves don’t know precisely what would define  11 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  substantial improvement.  But obviously, as long as the costs and other concerns do not emerge,  we’ll be looking for, you know, something that is substantial in terms of a better job market. 

[SECTION]

PETER COOK.  Peter Cook with Bloomberg Television.  Mr. Chairman, if I could follow up just on your last response there.  Given the fiscal cliff, is it possible that if the country, if the policy makers were not to agree to some sort of deficit deal by the end of this year and we were to go over the fiscal cliff, that the size of these asset purchases could indeed grow in response to that?  And more specifically, you coined the phrase “fiscal cliff,” and I wanted to get your take on whether you still feel it’s the most appropriate language to describe what would happen at the beginning of the year.  There are some Americans who may be alarmed by the language, some economists say it’s more of a slope.  Do you still feel it’s appropriate given the circumstances— the contraction, the fiscal contraction, that would come if there is no deal? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, for the first part of your question if the economy actually went off the fiscal cliff, our assessment, the CBO’s assessment, outside forecasters, all think that that would have very significant adverse effects on the economy and on the unemployment rate.  And so, on the margin, we would try to do what we could.  We would perhaps increase a bit.  But I just want to, again, be clear that we cannot offset the full impact of the fiscal cliff.  It’s just too big given the tools that we have available and the limitations on our policy toolkit at this point.  On terms of the terminology, well, and people have different preferences about what they want to call things, I think it’s a sensible term because I think of the fiscal policies providing support to the economy.  If fiscal policy becomes very contractionary, the economy will, I think, go off a cliff.  I think that it’s reasonable to be concerned about this.  I don’t buy the idea that a short-term descent off the fiscal cliff would be not costly.  I think it would be costly and, in fact, we’re already seeing costs.  Why is it that consumer confidence  12 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  dropped so sharply this week?  Why is it that small business confidence dropped so sharply?  Why is—why are the markets volatile?  Why is business investment at among its weakest levels  during the recovery?  I think all of these things, at least to some extent, can be traced to the anticipation and the concern about the fiscal cliff and I think that, you know, we don’t know exactly what would happen but I think there is certainly a risk that it could be serious and, therefore, I think it is very important.  The most helpful thing that could—that, I think, Congress, the Administration could do right now is find a resolution that, on the one hand, achieves long-run fiscal sustainability, which is critical, absolutely critical for a healthy economy, but also avoids derailing the recovery which is currently in process. 

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Mr. Chairman, I just—I want to try to square up some numbers.  The threshold that you announced today for when rate hikes might start is 6½ percent.  The Committee’s assessment of the longer-run unemployment rate is 6 percent, or perhaps a bit lower, and the longer-run equilibrium fed funds rate is around 4 percent according to these projections.  It suggests that when the Fed does start raising interest rates down the road, it might have to move fairly quickly to get to some equilibrium fed funds rate.  Is that, specifically, is that the case and, more generally, can you talk about what this framework that you set up today says about the exit strategy that you had laid out some time ago and whether that’s evolving or changing? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it’s a good question.  So first of all, we don’t have a precise estimate of the long-run sustainable unemployment rate.  The estimates that were provided in the Summary of Economic Projections today, as has been the case for a while, is 5.2 to 6.0 percent.  So, it could be well less than 6½ percent, so that gives us some time.    13 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  My anticipation is that the removal of accommodation after the takeoff point, whenever that occurs, would be relatively gradual.  I don’t think we’re looking at a rapid increase.  Of course, that depends on where inflation is and other conditions.  But it’s—the path that we’re basing these numbers on is one that assumes, first of all, as you anticipated, assumes an increase in the funds rate first occurring some time after unemployment goes below 6½ percent, but does not necessarily assume a rapid increase after that.  And I—what we said in our statement is that we would take a balanced approach.  In other words, you know, once we get to that point, we remains well controlled, which I fully anticipate, I think that the rate of increase in rates would be moderate.   This is consistent—the exit strategy that we put out is consistent with our statement today because the exit strategy was primarily about how we would normalize the balance sheet over time.  And at this time we have not made any changes in that, and we believe that some increase in the size of our balance sheet is consistent still with that general sequence that we laid out in the minutes a year and a half ago.  That being said, if the balance sheet grows by enough, we know, radically change the time to normalization or the time to exit.   

[SECTION]

ZACHARY GOLDFARB.  Thank you.  Zach Goldfarb.  I’m going to continue the two question trend and ask—first on the fiscal cliff, it sounds like you would prefer a sensible balance of fiscal consolidation and support for the recovery, but if people in Congress can’t do that in the next two weeks, do you think postponing off this whole consolidation is preferable to going over the cliff?  And then, on the monetary policy actions today, can you give us a little bit 14 of 34   December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  more color on how you set the thresholds at what they were?  And what the alternatives were,  and how you weighed various alternative but similar policies? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.  I’m hoping that the Congress will do the right thing on the fiscal cliff.  I—you know, there’s a problem with kicking the can down the road.  It might avoid some of the short-term impact on the recovery, but it could create concerns about our longer-term fiscal situation and I don’t want to see that.  So I think for the best—it’s in the best interest of the economy to come to a two-part solution, if you will.  Part one is to modify fiscal policy in a way that doesn’t create enormous headwinds for the recovery in the near term.  And part two is to at least take important steps towards achieving a framework, at least, by which, perhaps through further negotiation, the Congress and the Administration can achieve a sustainable path for fiscal policy.  That—both of these parts are very important.  I don’t think that we can consider these negotiations a success unless both of them happen.   [Speaker unknown; inaudible remark]  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No.  I think they’re equally important.  On the threshold numbers, this is based—these numbers are based on substantial analysis done by staff, both here and at the Reserve Banks, trying to assess under so-called optimal policy, or in the best policy that we can come up with, what would the interest rate path look like and how would it be connected or correlated with changes in unemployment and inflation.  And when we do that analysis, what we find is that the best interest rate path—as best as we can determine it based on our models and analysis, which is obviously imperfect—has rates remaining low until unemployment drops below 6½ percent.  And it projects if we put in the two—the half of a percentage point above the 2 percent goal as a kind of protection against any problem with price  15 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  stability, but our projections, our actual forecast suggests that inflation will not go there.   Inflation will stay around 2 percent, which will be consistent with our longer-term objective.   

[SECTION]

ZACH GOLDFARB.  [Inaudible Remark]   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If we got important new information about the structure of the economy, it’s possible, but I consider it relatively unlikely and this is one of the best—this is one of the advantages of this approach over the date-based approach.  If information comes in which says the economy is stronger or weaker than we expected, that would, in principle, require a change in the date.  But it doesn’t necessarily require a change in the thresholds because that date adjustment can be made by markets just simply by looking at their own forecasts of when unemployment will cross the line and the behavior of inflation. 

[SECTION]

SCOTT SPOERRY.  Scott Spoerry from CNN, sir.  When you were appearing on 60 Minutes, one of the things that happened was that you visited your old hometown, and you talked a little bit about how the economy had affected people that you grew up with and affected the people down there.  There are a lot of just regular people like that who are out on the countryside wondering what really happens to them if we do go over the federal cliff.  Taxes go up, spending goes down.  Do they need to look for a recession?  Are employers going to really cut back on the employment, do you think?  What do people out there really need to worry about and prepare for when it comes to actually going over that fiscal cliff, if the folks in Washington can’t get their act together? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I come from a part of South Carolina which has been economically challenged for quite a long time and remains so.  I mean certain parts of South Carolina have developed pretty strongly but the part where I come from—mostly agricultural, it has a little bit of manufacturing—has a very high unemployment rate, a high foreclosure rate,  16 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  and people are having a hard time there.  And I’ve visited there a few times since I became  Chairman. So, part of the reason that, you know, we are engaging these policies is to try and create a stronger economy—more jobs—so that folks across the country, including places like the one where I grew up, you know, will have more opportunity to have better lives for themselves.  So that’s extremely important and I think it’s very important that we not just look at the numbers.  It’s easy to look at the unemployment rate and say, well it’s one-tenth or two-tenths.  Every tenth means, you know, many, many people are represented there.  So it is very important to try to keep in mind the reality of unemployment, of foreclosure, of weak wage growth, et cetera, so we always try to do that.  And I want to—it’s always a delicate balance—you don’t want to scare people.  And I actually believe that Congress will come up with a solution, and I certainly hope they will.  But as many analysts, not just the Fed, have pointed out, if the fiscal cliff was allowed to occur, and certainly if it were sustained for any period, it could have a very negative effect on hiring, jobs, wages, economic activity, investment.  And of course, the consequences of that will be felt by everybody but certainly by those in areas like where I grew up that are relatively weak economically, would no doubt would feel the greater brunt.  So, it’s exceptionally urgent and important that the Congress and the Administration come to a sensible agreement on this issue. 

[SECTION]

SCOTT SPOERRY.  Okay, sir, I had a follow-up, too.  I’m not going to ask you whether we’re in a bond bubble.  But obviously, the new guidance that you’ve given in the FOMC statement is going to give a lot more clues to people who own bonds about when they might start lightening up their bond portfolios and changing the composition of what they own.  Was  17 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL   concerns about information about bond prices and things happening in a big hurry, in terms of some sort of a bubble popping—was that a consideration in adding this transparency? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I wouldn’t say it was an important motivation for adding transparency.  I think transparency has a lot of value.  But it is the—it is a fact that this greater clarity will help markets better predict how bond yields will behave.  As we go forward in time, if the economy continues to strengthen as we hope, as the exit comes closer for the Federal Reserve, then you would expect longer-term bond yields to begin to rise.  And the more information we can provide to markets about the conditionality under which the Fed would consider removing accommodation, the better information they’ll have about the likely path of bonds and that will allow for a smoother adjustment.  So I think that’s a positive aspect of this communication.  It—I wouldn’t say it was the major reason.  The major reason is to give the potential advantage.

ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times.  Mr. Chairman, you said a moment ago that these thresholds are based on an analysis of optimal policy.  In the optimal policy path that Vice Chair Yellen laid out in her speech a few weeks ago, it showed the first rise in interest rates occurring in early 2016 and then rates rising very slowly after that.  Is that the policy that the Fed is now following?  And secondly, if I may, you referred to a number of inflation forecasts in your introductory remarks.  In that case, how will we ever know that the inflation threshold has been hit?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So, the kind of optimal policy path that Vice Chairman Yellen showed is indicative of the kinds of analysis we’ve done.  I mean, we’ve run it for a variety of different scenarios, different assumptions about models, and so on, but the general  18 of 34  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  character of that interest rate path, i.e., that it stays low until unemployment is in the vicinity of 6½ or a little lower, and then rises relatively slowly, which goes back to the question that was asked earlier, that it doesn’t involve a rapid removal of accommodation after that point is reached.  That is consistent with that kind of analysis, and that’s the type of analysis that was not the only thing we looked at but was informative in our discussion.  You’ll note also in that kind of policy path, of the type that she discussed, that inflation stays essentially at 2 or very close to 2. In terms of inflation forecast, the—what the Committee will do on a regular basis is include in its statement its views of where inflation is likely to be a year from now.  For example, currently, we already say that, you know, we expect inflation to run at or below the Committee’s objective in a longer term.  The intellectual exercise we’ll be doing is asking ourselves if we maintain low rates along the lines suggested by this policy, would we expect inflation to cross the threshold or reach that level?  Now, it’s very important that the public, the media, the markets find our projections credible, obviously.  And so for that reason, you know, we will be referring extensively to publicly available information such as various measures of inflation—I mentioned some in my opening remarks—outside forecasts, the breakevens from inflation protected bonds, et cetera.  So, if our outlook deviates in any sense in a significant way from sort of what all these things are saying, at a minimum, it will be incumbent on me and the rest of us to explain that.  But my expectation is that our projections will be broadly consistent with public views, public information, and so I think we can manage the credibility issue.  But again, just to be clear, the projection that matters for our determination is the one that the Committee collectively comes up with.   19 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPLEBAUM.  Sir, you’ve articulated more clearly than ever your commitment to reduce unemployment, but you’ve also said that you’re not actually doing anything more to achieve that goal—that you still expect it to be three years away, that you’re disappointed with the pace of progress, and that inflation is not the limiting factor.  What is the limiting factor?  Why is the Fed not announcing today additional measures to reduce unemployment?  What would it take for you to get that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we took—the question was whether this was something new relative to September, I think September was the date where we did do a substantial increase in accommodation.  At that point, we announced our dissatisfaction with the state of the labor market and the outlook for jobs and said we would take further action if the outlook didn’t improve.  And what we’ve done today is really just following through what we said.  So, I would say that, you know, looking at it from the perspective of September, that we have, in fact, taken significant additional action to provide support for the recovery and for job creation.  The reason—one of the considerations though, as I’ve talked about, is that, you know, given that we are now in the world of unconventional policy that has both uncertain costs and uncertain efficacy or uncertain benefits, you know, that creates a more—somewhat more complicated policy decision than the old style of just changing the federal funds rate.  You know, there are concerns that I’ve talked about in these briefings before that if the balance sheet gets indefinitely large that there would be potential risks in terms of financial stability, in terms of certain cost on policy that doesn’t exist when you’re dealing only with the federal funds rate.  And so what we’re trying to do here is balance the potential benefits, in terms of lower 20 of 34   December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  unemployment and inflation at target, against the reality that as the balance sheet gets bigger that  there’s greater costs that might be associated with that, and those have to be taken to account. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPLEBAUM.  Sir, if I can just follow, so these forecasts presumably incorporate the actions taken into account, and so given those actions, it will still be three years until you achieve your goals.  Is the message to people who are unemployed basically, “We are doing all we can?”  Is this the conclusion that, given that balance of factors, this is the most we can expect? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, first of all, again, these—the projections that you’re looking at are based on each individual—this is not a Committee collective projection.  What they are, of course, is 19 separate participants making their own projections based on their own views of optimal policy.  So, for example, it includes those folks who think that we shouldn’t be doing any more purchases and their forecasts are included in there as well.  So, it’s not exactly an apples to apples comparison, but it is true that if we could wave a magic wand and get unemployment down to 5 percent tomorrow, obviously we would do that, but there are constraints in terms of the dynamics of the economy, in terms of the power of these tools, and in terms of the fact that we do need to take into account, you know, the possibility of other costs and risks that might be associated with a large expansion of our balance sheet.

DARREN GERSH.  To just—Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report.  So just following up on that last question, how helpful would it be to see, as part of the fiscal cliff resolution, some near-term stimulus?  The President’s proposed that.  Do you think—how helpful do you think that would be and, I’ll ask my follow up now, whatever happened to your southern accent? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, on the second one, I’d like to think I’m bilingual.  When I go home sometimes I—it comes out pretty strongly, but I won’t try to do that here.  So, I  21 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  try to be careful, as you know, not to give views on specific tax and spending programs.  I think,  of course, obviously those are the province of the Administration and Congress.  The attitude I’ve taken has been that, at a minimum, Congress should try to do no harm, that they should try to avoid policies that significantly slow or derail the recovery at this point.  So I think that’s the critical thing along with the long-term objective of achieving a sustainable fiscal path.  Now, given that basic recommendation, you know, Congress can consider variations.  For example, if they believe that they can achieve a strong, credible future path for fiscal policy, that would give them potentially some space to do something a little bit more expansionary in the short term.  But, those are judgments I think that Congress has to make about whether they can simultaneously continue supportive fiscal policy in the short term while maintaining the credibility that, in fact, they will be addressing our structural deficit problems in the longer term.  And that is I think really a question for them and for their staff. 

[SECTION]

KRISTINA PETERSON.  Kristina Peterson of Dow Jones.  Looking over the past year or several years, how would you evaluate the Fed’s accuracy making economic forecasts, and how does that affect the ability to make monetary policy decisions, especially as it’s connected to the thresholds? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think it’s fair to say that we have overestimated the pace of growth, total output growth, GDP growth, from the beginning of the recovery and we have had therefore—had to continue to scale down our estimates of output growth.  But interestingly, at the same time, we have been more accurate, not perfectly accurate by any means, but we’ve been somewhat more accurate in forecasting unemployment.  And how do you reconcile those two things?  I talked about this in remarks I gave at the New York Economic Club recently, right before Thanksgiving.  And I think the reconciliation is that what we’re  22 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  learning is that, at least temporarily, the financial crisis may have reduced somewhat the  underlying potential growth rate of the U.S. economy.  It has interfered with business creation, with investment, with technological advances, and so on.  And that can account for at least part of the somewhat slower growth.  At the same time, though, what—of course, what monetary policy influences is not potential growth, not the underlying structural growth.  That’s for—many other different kinds of policies affect that.  What monetary policy affects, primarily, is the state of the business cycle, the amount of excess unemployment or the extent of recession in the economy.  And there, I think we’ve also perhaps underestimated a bit the recession, but we’ve been much closer there.  And I think therefore that we’ve been able to address that somewhat more effectively with quite accommodative policies.  That being said, of course, we have over time, as we have seen disappointment in growth and job creation, we have obviously, as we did in September, have added accommodation and we’ve continued—we continue to reassess the outlook.  I think it’s only fair to say that economic forecasting beyond a few quarters is very, very difficult.  And what we basically are trying to do is create a plausible scenario which we think is reasonably likely—base policy on that, but we prepared to adjust as new information comes in and as the outlook changes, and inevitably it will. 

[SECTION]

GREG IP.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Greg Ip of the Economist.  Economists have long believed that central banks cannot affect the unemployment rate in the long run.  That’s one reason you’ve seen a move towards central banks being given mandates for low inflation only.  Can you explain if the Fed, by tying its monetary policy so explicitly to an unemployment threshold, whether that is consistent or inconsistent with that longstanding view?  And, if it’s consistent, how is this superior to simply having a threshold for inflation only?  And would the approach that you’re now taking be possible if the Fed had only a mandate for low inflation?  23 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it’s entirely consistent with your view, with the point that you made.  So let me just reiterate it.  As we stated, in fact, in our January set of principles, the central bank cannot control unemployment in the long run.  I’d add a caveat to this.  There’s a little bit of a caveat here, which is that very extended periods of unemployment can interfere with the workings of the labor market.  And so, if the Fed were not to address a large unemployment problem for a long time, it might, in fact, have some influence on the long-term unemployment rate.  But as a general rule, as a general rule, and I think this is the right baseline, the long-term unemployment rate is determined by a range of structural features of the economy and a range of economic policies and not by monetary policy.  So that being said, what our 6½ percent threshold is is—as I said in my opening remarks, it is not a target—what it is is a guidepost in terms of when the beginning of the reduction of accommodation could begin.  It could be later than that, but at least by that time, no earlier than that time.  So it’s really more like a reaction function or a Taylor rule, if you will.  I don’t want—I’m—I’ll get—I’m ready to get the phone call from John Taylor.  It is not a Taylor rule but it has the same feature that it relates policy to observables in the economy, such as unemployment and inflation.  So, what it’s basically doing is saying how our policy will evolve over time as the economy evolves.  It has no implication that we can affect the long-run unemployment rate, which we believe is lower than 6½ percent.  We think it’s somewhere between 5 and 6 according to our SEP projections.  We are a dual mandate central bank and I think that providing information on both sides is more helpful.  So, I understand your point but I think that it’s—that providing information on unemployment and inflation gives more information to the markets, to the public that allows them to infer how our policy is likely to evolve.

[SECTION]

WYATT ANDREWS.  Mr. Chairman, Wyatt Andrews, CBS News.  I’d like—still like to hear a little bit more about why you made this announcement today specifically tying federal funds and your policy to the 6.5 percent number?  I’m sure you have some sort of theory about what you hope changes in the economy as a result of this announcement.  If so, what is it? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we think it’s a better form of communication.  We think it’s—by using the thresholds which ties rates to economic conditions, we’re more transparent about what’s going to determine our policy in the future.  The date-based guidance, it served a purpose.  But it had the problem that whenever economic outlook changed, the Committee was faced with the question of whether we should change the date-based guidance, and we did change it a couple of times.  But that was a nontransparent process.  Nobody understood exactly why we made a particular change because we were not providing any kind of fundamental information about how our policy is linked to the underlying outlook.  And so, we, I believe, certainly, that this approach is superior.  I’m not saying it’s the best possible approach, there may be other things we can do in the future.  We’re always looking to find ways to improve our communication but I do think it’s more transparent and will allow the markets to respond quickly and promptly to changes in the outlook by adjusting when they think rate increases will begin, and therefore, it’ll act, to some extent, like an automatic stabilizer.  So if the outlook worsens and that leads markets to think that the increase in rates is further out in the future, that will tend to lower longer-term rates and that would tend to be supportive of the economy.  So that has an automatic stabilizer type effect.  It kind of offsets adverse shocks.  So it’s a better form of communication.  As I said, we discussed it quite extensively at the last meeting.  And  25 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  so—and frankly, given that it’s a relatively complex change, it seemed like it would be a good idea to do it at a meeting where there was a press conference.  So, we decided since we’re ready  to go why not make the change earlier and get the benefit earlier. 

[SECTION]

WYATT ANDREWS.  As a quick follow-up, are you—did you see a level of uncertainty in the business community that you hope to solve by this announcement? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, at the moment, I think that the expectations of the business community and of the Federal Open Market Committee happen to be pretty well aligned.  If you look at the financial market indicators, the future federal funds rate path, it’s pretty consistent with the mid-2015 date-based guidance that we had been providing.  So I’m not saying there was a major inconsistency between what the business community was expecting, the problem is that, looking forward, that what happens if there is a significant change either for the better, or for the worse, in the outlook?  Under the date-based guidance, that would require the Committee to determine, you know, what the new date is and to make that change in a nontransparent way.  But under this threshold-based guidance, the markets and the business community can make that calculation on their own and adjust that—their estimates of when rates will begin to increase based only on their own forecast and not have to wait for the Federal Open 

[SECTION]

JOSH ZUMBRUN.  Mr. Chairman, Josh Zumbrun, Bloomberg News.  By mid-2015, the recovery is going to be nearly six years old.  The average postwar recovery has been a little less than five.  We’re already banking on a very long expansion.  You expect, by mid-2015, the funds rate is going to be at zero percent, your balance sheet is potentially at $4 trillion.  If the business  26 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  cycle runs out of steam and you’re still at zero percent interest rates, does the Fed no longer have  a forceful response in that situation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the Fed will always, you know, keep—we’ve innovated quite a bit in the last few years and it’s always possible we could find new ways to provide support for the economy.  But it’s certainly true, I’ve—you know, there’s no doubt that with interest rates near zero and with the balance sheet already large, that the ability to provide additional accommodation is not unlimited and that that’s just a reality and that actually is an argument, I think, for being a little bit more aggressive now.  I mean, it’s a really good objective to get the economy moving, to get some momentum that protects the economy against unanticipated shocks that might occur, and gets us off the zero bound earlier.  So, exactly for those reasons, the kind of risks that arise when the—when policy interest rates are close to zero, and the greater difficulty in providing additional policy support, I think that’s an argument for being somewhat more proactive now, when we still have the ability to do that, and to try to get the economy, you know, back to a healthy condition.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Hi.

DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak with American Banker.  My question pertains to the Volcker Rule.  Regulators, earlier this year, seemed cautiously optimistic that they’d be able to finalize a rule by the end of the year.  However, that seems a bit unlikely at this point.  And now, as you know, lawmakers are calling for a two-year implementation delay on the rule.  Given the fact that it’s been such a lengthy process, can you tell us where things stand at this point?  How much closer are we to a final rule?  Have the agencies been able to work out their differences?  And, if you may, a prediction on when we might actually see a rule.  27 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We’ve made quite a bit of progress.  It’s a difficult, complex rule, as you know, and we’ve had, I think I recall, 18,000 comments or something like that.  So it’s been a lot to look at.  There are a lot of concerns that arose even from, you know, foreign commenters about the effects on their bond markets, et cetera.  So there’s been a lot of work to do.  There, I think there is quite a bit of agreement, I wouldn’t say a final agreement, but quite a bit of agreement on key points among the regulators, at this juncture.  And, of course, if Congress gives us some other instruction, we’ll follow that, but so far, we haven’t received any different instruction.  So it’s our intent to try to get this done early in 2013.

PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes, Fox Business, Mr. Chairman.  Since your last press conference with us, we’ve had an election.  One of the candidates in that election, Governor Romney, said that he would not reappoint you to a third term as Chairman.  President Obama did not weigh in on the issue but he was—he did win reelection.  If the President were to call you and say, “Ben, your country needs your continued stewardship at the Federal Reserve.  We need you to stay and finish the job, see this through.”  Would you consider it?  Would you do it, and, by chance, have you had any conversations to that effect with the President or anybody on his team?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So to answer the last part, no, I haven’t had any conversations.  I think the President has got quite a few issues he needs to be thinking about, from fiscal cliff to many other appointments and so on.  From my own perspective, I just, I really don’t have anything to add from the last press conference.  I am very much engaged in these difficult issues that we’re discussing today, and I have not been spending time thinking about my own future.  So I don’t really have anything to add there. 28 of 34   December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  

[SECTION]

KEVIN HALL.  Okay, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you.  The two questions, taking the Goldfarb rule into effect, one having to do with the CPI, there’s a lot of debate now with the Boehner plan about this chained CPI.  As an econ—not as a Fed Chairman but as an economist—is there a logic in going to that?  Do you think it’s a move that should be done talked about the importance, not looking at the 6.5 percent threshold, but the broader conditions.  A big debate—Steve Liesman’s nemesis talks a lot about people being beamed to Mars.  In your mind, what is happening in the job market?  Are we creating jobs?  Is that why it’s coming down or is it because people—the degree of discouraged workers?  What is your sense of how quickly it’s fallen because of new employment? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So, on the first question, the chained CPI versus the fixed-weight CPI is a technical issue.  The chained CPI is technically better, according to most economists, because it allows for changes in the mix of goods and services that people actually consume more effectively.  However, whether, you know, whether that’s more appropriate for, say, Social Security indexing or not, I think that’s ultimately a political decision.  I suppose a rejoinder would be that neither the CPI nor the chained CPI may necessarily be a particularly good measure of the cost of living for Social Security recipients.  So, those are the kinds of questions that Congress is going to have to deal with.  Second part of your question was?  

[SECTION]

KEVIN HALL.  The debate over the extent to which the unemployment rate is falling from—

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Ah, yes.  Sorry. 

[SECTION]

KEVIN HALL.  New jobs versus people leaving. 29 of 34   December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  Well, you know, you can see the comparison by looking, for example, at the household survey, which gives estimates of how many people are added to the labor force, how many are added to the employed, how many people are leaving the labor force, and it’s true that part of the decline in unemployment—and indeed all of it in the last reading, but over the recovery, part of the decline in unemployment has come from declines in participation rates, that is, people leaving the labor force.  Some of that decline in participation appears to be due to longer-run factors, aging and changing patterns of work among women.  So those things were probably not directly related to the recession, for example.  But beyond that downward trend, there’s been some additional decline in labor force participation, and in the ratio of employment to population, which presumably is linked to discouragement about the state of the labor force.  So that certainly is part of the issue.  That being said, obviously there has been a good bit of job creation.  You can see that either in the household survey or in the payroll establishment survey.  So I think there’s no doubt that the labor market is considerably better today than it was two years ago, there’s not any question about that.  But it’s also the case that many indicators of the labor market remain quite weak, ranging from the number of long-term unemployed to the number of people who have part-time work who would like full-time work.  Wage growth obviously is very weak, and I could go on.  So, it may be that the labor market is even a bit weaker than the current unemployment rate suggests, but I think that it is nevertheless the case that there has been improvement since the trough a couple of years ago.  

[SECTION]

CATHERINE HOLLANDER.  Mr. Chairman, Catherine Hollander from National Journal.  How concerned are you that markets will have to tank in order to get lawmakers to reach a deal on the fiscal cliff, and what do you make of their recent complacency?  Is there a Wall Street–Washington disconnect? 30 of 34   December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Interesting question.  Well, I certainly hope that markets won’t have to tank.  I don’t—we want to have confidence, not just in markets but in businesses and households as well, and the best way the fiscal policymakers can achieve that is by coming to a solution as quickly as possible.  Markets have obviously already responded to some extent, up and down; you can see from day to day how they respond to news about the negotiations.  But on the other hand, it’s also true, if you look at the experience, I think the very informative experience of the debt limit debate in August of 2011, that both confidence and markets remain pretty sanguine up to pretty close to the point where it looked like there was actually a chance the debt limit would not be raised.  And then, of course, there was a pretty sharp shock, particularly to confidence, about the time of the, you know, of the final debates.  So it’s not unusual to see in both directions.  Obviously, things go badly, but perhaps if things go especially well, that would be good news, and maybe right now markets are sort of taking an average of those two possibilities.  But again, just to reiterate, I don’t think any policymaker, including the Fed, should be responding to markets.  What we should be doing is making policy, you know, based on the fundamentals and doing what’s best for the economy and I hope that fiscal policymakers will follow that injunction as well. 

[SECTION]

STEVE BECKNER.  Mr. Chairman, Steve Beckner of Market News International.  With the federal government borrowing roughly $1 trillion a year and now with the Fed on pace to buy roughly a trillion dollars a year in bonds, are you concerned about a public, and possibly global, perception that the Fed is accommodating not just growth but accommodating federal borrowing needs, and are you concerned about what this might do to the Fed’s credibility, and the 31 of 34   December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  credibility of U.S. finances in general, and the credibility of the dollar as the world’s leading  currency? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, first of all, just a couple of facts.  The—we’re buying Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, about half and half, roughly.  So we’re buying considerably less than the Treasury is issuing and, moreover, the share of outstanding Treasuries that the Federal Reserve owns is not all that different from what it was before the crisis, because while our holdings have increased, so has the—obviously the stock of Treasuries in public hands.   So it’s not quite evident that there has been such a radical shift there.  You know, we’ve been increasing our balance sheet now for some time, and we’ve been very clear that this is a temporary measure.  It’s a way to provide additional accommodation to an economy which needs support.  We’ve been equally clear that we will normalize the balance sheet, that we will reduce the size of our holdings and—whether by letting them run off or by selling assets in the future.  So this is, again, only a temporary step.  It would be quite a different matter if we were buying these assets and holding them indefinitely.  That would be monetization.  We’re not doing that.  We are very clear about our intentions.  And I think up until now, it seems our credibility has been quite good.  There is not any sign either of current inflation or of any—there’s no strong evidence that there are any increases in inflation expectations for that matter, looking at financial things that we have to look at.  Remember, I talked earlier about the potential costs of a large balance sheet.  We want to be sure that there’s no misunderstanding, that there’s no effect on inflation expectations from the size of our balance sheet.  That’s one of the things we have to look at, but as to this point, there just really is no evidence that people are taking it that way.  And I guess it’s worth pointing out—of course we’ve been very focused on the United States  32 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  here, but we’re not the only central bank that has increased the size of its balance sheet.  The Japanese, the Europeans, the British have all done the same, and very much more or less to the same extent in terms of the fraction of GDP, and I think the sophisticated market players and the  public understand that this is part of a collective need, a need to provide additional accommodation to weak economies and not an accommodation of fiscal policy. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Last but not least, Greg Robb, MarketWatch.  There seems to be growing evidence that some of the MBS purchases, the impact of the MBS purchases, are that banks are holding on to some of the gains and not passing them on to the borrowers.  Is there anything you can do about that and are you concerned about that?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So the question is—just to restate your question—is about the spread between the mortgage rates that the public pays and the yields to mortgage-backed securities that banks may hold, and the question is, is that spread widening so that the full benefit of the reduction in MBS yields is not being passed through, that’s the question.  Well, I have to make sure everybody heard it, so you could answer.  Our analysis suggests that it takes time—two points.  The first point is that while we don’t expect a hundred percent pass-through of MBS yields to mortgage rates, our empirical and theoretical analysis—and we’ve had quite a bit of work done on this issue—suggests that over time, the great majority of the decline in MBS yields does get passed through to mortgage rates.  So we do anticipate, over time, that the full benefit will, or most of the benefit will, be seen by retail customers.  And indeed, we have seen already a pretty significant decline since September in retail mortgage rates.  But one thing that’s perhaps confusing this issue a little bit is that there are other things happening in the economy which are affecting those spreads.  So, for example, there are capacity limitations, which are allowing banks to, you know, to charge higher yields, there’s extra costs like concerns about putback risk,  33 of 34 December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL  for example.  There’s higher g-fees.  So there’s a number of things happening in the economy which will tend, all else equal, to raise that spread between mortgage rates and MBS yields, so  that’s unfortunate.  What we can try to do there, of course, is to try to encourage good policy, for example, on putbacks, that will reduce the perceived risk and cost to the banks of making mortgage loans.  But again, you know, I think most of those things, like g-fees, for example, are not really in our control, but, again, taking all those issues as constant, it does seem to be the case that, over a period of time, not immediately, but over a period of time, most of the declines in MBS yields do find their way through to mortgage customers and thereby strengthen the housing  34 of 34",Ben Bernanke,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
8,2013-03-20,"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon.   The Federal Open Market Committee concluded a two-day meeting earlier today.  As always, my colleagues and I reviewed recent economic and financial developments and discussed the economic outlook.  The data since our January meeting have been generally consistent with our expectation that the fourth-quarter pause in the recovery would prove temporary and that moderate economic growth would resume.  Spending by households and businesses has continued to expand, and the housing sector has seen further gains.  The jobs growing more quickly, total hours of work have increased, the rate of filings of new claims for unemployment insurance has fallen, and the unemployment rate has continued to tick down.  However, at 7.7 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated.  The Committee also remains concerned that restrictive fiscal policies may slow economic growth and job creation in coming months.   We continue to monitor the recent increases in gasoline prices, which appear to be due mostly to passing factors such as refinery shutdowns for maintenance.  Apart from temporary variations in energy prices, inflation is running somewhat below the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent.  Importantly, longer-term inflation expectations remain stable.  Overall, still-high unemployment, in combination with relatively low inflation, underscores the need for policies that will support progress towards maximum employment in a context of price stability.   In conjunction with this meeting, the 19 participants in our policy discussion—the 7 Board members and 12 Reserve Bank presidents—submitted individual economic projections.  1 of 26 March 20, 2013  As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL monetary policy.  To summarize, the participants’ projections for economic growth have a central tendency of 2.3 to 2.8 percent for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.7 percent in 2015.  The central tendency of their projections of the unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of this year is 7.3 to 7.5 percent, declining to 6.0 to 6.5 percent in the final quarter of 2015.  Most participants see inflation gradually increasing toward the Committee’s longer-run target; the central tendency of their projections for inflation is 1.3 to 1.7 percent this year and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2015.   As you already know from the policy statement, we are continuing the asset purchase program first announced in September.  This decision was supported by our review at the meeting of the likely efficacy, costs, and risks of additional purchases.  Let me briefly summarize the cost–benefit analysis supporting our decision.   Although estimates of the efficacy of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases are necessarily uncertain, most participants agreed that these purchases—by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, including mortgage rates—continue to provide meaningful support to economic growth and job creation.  However, most also agreed that this monetary tool would likely not be able on its own to fully offset major economic headwinds, such as those that might arise from significant near-term fiscal restraint or from a sharp increase in global financial stresses.   We also had a thorough discussion of possible costs and risks of continued expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  The risks include possible adverse implications of additional purchases for the functioning of securities markets, and the potential effects—under various scenarios—of a larger balance sheet on the Federal Reserve’s earnings from its asset holdings and, hence, on its remittances to the Treasury.  The Committee also considered possible 2 of 26 March 20, 2013  risks to financial stability, such as might arise if persistently low rates lead some market Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL participants to take on excessive risk in a “reach for yield.”  In the Committee’s view, these costs remain manageable but will continue to be monitored, and we will take them into appropriate account as we determine the size, pace, and composition of our asset purchases.   As for today, our policy decision had two main elements.  First, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  It bears emphasizing that the Committee has described this program in terms of a monthly pace of purchases, rather than as a total amount of expected purchases, and has tied the evolution of the program to economic criteria—specifically, to the achievement of a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.  Within this framework, the Committee could vary the pace of purchases as progress is made toward its economic objectives or if its assessment of the efficacy and costs of the program changes.  At this meeting, the Committee judged that no adjustment was warranted.   Second, the Committee kept the target for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and reaffirmed its expectation that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, we anticipate that this exceptionally low range for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.   3 of 26 March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL I should note, as I have on other occasions, that the economic conditions provided in this forward guidance are thresholds, not triggers.  Crossing one or more of these thresholds will not lead automatically to an increase in rates.  Rather, the Committee will assess at that time whether the outlook justifies raising its target for the federal funds rate.  This guidance will help market participants assess how the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy is likely to respond to economic developments, but its broader purpose is to assure households and businesses that monetary policy will continue to support the recovery even as the pace of economic growth and job creation picks up.  In their individual projections, 14 of the 19 FOMC participants saw the first increase in the target for the federal funds rate as occurring in 2015 or 2016.   Let me comment briefly on how the two main pieces of our policy accommodation—asset purchases and guidance about future changes in the federal funds rate—fit together.  The purpose of the asset purchases is to increase the economy’s near-term momentum, with the goal of improving the outlook for the labor market and helping to promote a self-sustaining recovery with price stability.  The forward rate guidance, in turn, provides information about when the Committee will begin considering the removal of policy accommodation through increases in the target for the federal funds rate.  Importantly, the Committee expects a considerable interval to pass between the time when the Committee will cease adding accommodation through asset purchases and the time when it will be appropriate to begin removing accommodation by moving the federal funds rate target toward more normal levels.  As always, in deciding on the appropriate stance of policy, the Committee will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.   In sum, the Committee anticipates moderate economic growth, supported by household and business spending and a strengthening housing sector.  The labor market has shown signs of 4 of 26 March 20, 2013  improvement in recent months, but the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Inflation is Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL expected to remain low, and fiscal policy has become somewhat more restrictive.  In light of its outlook, and following a review of the efficacy and costs of additional asset purchases, the Committee today reaffirmed its asset purchase program and its federal funds guidance.   Thank you very much.  I would be glad to take your questions.

YLAN MUI.  Hi.  Ylan Mui, Washington Post.  My question is around QE.  Obviously, we’ve seen some of your colleagues give more-specific criteria, give some color around what they’re looking for before they would consider exiting from QE.  Can you give us any additional color on what you’re looking for specifically in terms of substantial improvement in the labor level of disagreement among the Committee members over what that exit should look like?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, to take your second question first, the lack of thresholds comes from the complexity of the problem.  On the one hand, we have benefits, which are associated with improvements in the economy, but there are also costs associated with unconventional policy, such as potential effects on financial stability, which are hard to quantify and which people have different views about.  So, to this point, we’ve not been able to give quantitative thresholds for the asset purchases in the same way that we have for the federal funds rate target.  We’re going to continue to try to provide information as we go forward.  In particular, as I mentioned today, as we make progress towards our objective, we may adjust the flow rate of purchases month to month to appropriately calibrate the amount of accommodation we’re providing given the outlook for the labor market.   In terms of further color, again, given the complexity of the issue, we’ve not given quantitative analysis or quantitative thresholds.  I would say that we’ll be looking for sustained 5 of 26 March 20, 2013  improvement in a range of key labor market indicators, including, obviously, payrolls, Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL unemployment rate, but also others like the hiring rate, claims for unemployment insurance, quit rates, wage rates, and so on.  We’ll be looking for sustained improvement across a range of indicators, and in a way that’s taking place throughout the economy.  And since we’re looking at the outlook—we’re looking at the prospects rather than the current state of the labor market— we’ll also be looking at things like growth to try to understand whether there’s sufficient momentum in the economy to provide demand for labor going forward.  So that will allow us to look through, perhaps, some temporary fluctuations associated with short-term shocks or problems.   

[SECTION]

ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times.  Mr. Chairman, to follow up on that last point, what—you referred to the possibility of varying purchases, the rates of purchases per month.  What’s the difference in the conditions that would induce you to do that, as opposed to the substantial improvements in the labor market that would induce you to stop the program altogether?  Thank you.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the problem with having just a single criterion is that it’s all or nothing.  We maintain full speed ahead until we hit a certain target, and then, you know, we stop.  That would be, I think, very difficult for the markets to understand, to anticipate.  We think it makes more sense to have our policy variable, which is the rate of flow of purchases, respond in a more continuous or sensitive way to changes in the outlook.  So, as we make progress towards our ultimate objective of substantial improvement, we may adjust the rate of flow of purchases accordingly.  Now, we won’t do that every meeting; we won’t do that frequently.  But when we see that the condition or the situation has changed in a meaningful way, then we may well adjust the pace of purchases in order to keep the level of accommodation 6 of 26 March 20, 2013  consistent with the outlook, and, secondly, to help provide the markets with some sense of Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL progress—how much progress is being made so that it can make better judgments.   

[SECTION]

ROBIN HARDING.  Could you define “progress towards” at all, how you deal with that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, you know, as I just described what I mean by “substantial improvement,” it’s a broad-based improvement in a range of indicators as well as improvement in output and labor demand.  So, as we move—we see partial improvements, see modest improvement, as we see a period in which the labor market is doing better, and we have reason to think it might be stronger, then we might reduce accommodation at that point.  But it works in both directions.  If, subsequently, the labor market were to weaken, the outlook were to get worse, we could, of course, bring back accommodation back to the previous level.   

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman from CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, I have to keep coming back to this issue of adjusting the flow rate.  Are we near that time right now?  And how can the theoretically, we did 236,000 jobs in a month, and the unemployment rate fell by 0.2 percent.  Would that be sufficient to begin to adjust the purchases downward?  Thank you.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, that’s going to be obviously a decision that the Committee has to make, and we will—at each meeting, we’ll look at progress that’s been made since the last meeting, try to assess the outlook, try to determine whether there’s been a sufficient change to warrant a change in our policy stance.  Internally, we’ll use models and other indicators of the state of the labor market to try to make a good estimate of how much we need to change the rate of flow.  But, again, the point of this is to let the market see our behavior, to let them see how we respond to changes in the outlook.  And that way there will be a better ability, I 7 of 26 March 20, 2013  hope, for the markets to anticipate either a return to higher levels of purchases or the ultimate Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL phasing-out of the program.   

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Are we near that level now?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s an issue for—obviously, there has been improvement, let me say that.  We’ve seen improvement in the last four or five months.  The last five months, for example, we’ve seen over 200,000 jobs a month in the private sector.  Unemployment rate has come down four-tenths since September.  Unemployment claims, insurance claims are at the lowest level they’ve been since the crisis, so we are seeing improvement.  I think one thing we would need is to make sure that this is not a temporary improvement.  So, we’ve seen periods before where we had as many as 300,000 jobs for a couple of months, and then things weakened again.  So, I think an important criterion would be not just the improvement that we’ve seen, but is it going to be sustained for a number of months?   

[SECTION]

PEDRO DA COSTA.  Pedro da Costa from Reuters.  Mr. Chairman, I wanted to ask you about Cyprus a little bit, because you guys removed the reference in the statement referring to easing financial conditions, suggesting that you are alert to these new risks that seem to have emerged.  Doesn’t the fact that a country as small as Cyprus can set off such global reverberations suggest that the financial system is perhaps a lot more fragile than the Fed stress test suggests?  And then, separately, you discounted the estimate of the “too big to fail” subsidy that Elizabeth Warren threw at you during the Senate hearing a couple weeks ago.  I was wondering, does the Fed have its own estimate of what that subsidy is, and could you tell us what it is, if that’s the case?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, first, on the reverberations, it’s a difficult situation in Cyprus.  You’ve got a situation where the banking system is a large multiple of the size of the 8 of 26 March 20, 2013  economy.  And so, in the financial sense, it’s bigger than it is in a GDP sense.  And it’s a Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL difficult problem because the country faces both fiscal and bank capitalization issues.  And you’ve seen that there’s political stress in terms of trying to figure out how they’re going to meet the demands of the euro group for contributing to their rescue.  So, there are a lot of uncertainties and difficulties, and there’s questions about how—the way Cyprus is treated, what implications that might have for other countries and the like.  So, it does have some consequence.  But, having said that, you know, the vote failed and the markets are up today, and I don’t think that the impact has been enormous.  I mean, I think it’s something we’re paying attention to.  We hope that the Europeans will come up with an efficient and equitable solution.  We are monitoring very carefully, but, at this point, we’re not seeing a major risk to the U.S. financial system or the U.S. economy.   On the benefits of being too big to fail, no, we don’t have an estimate.  It’s pretty difficult to control for all the factors that go into determining the size of the subsidy.  I think there is some evidence that financial markets are, at least to some extent, taking into account the possibility that large financial institutions will fail.  You see, for example, spreads in the credit default swaps that indicate some probability of failure.  You see some discrimination among different institutions according to the bond market—interest rates that they get charged, and so on.  So there is some evidence of market discrimination.   That being said, I certainly never meant to say to Senator Warren—and I share her concern about too-big-to-fail, I think it’s a major issue—I never meant to imply that the problem was solved and gone.  It is not solved and gone; it’s still here, but there’s a lot of work in train.  We’re putting in the Basel capital standards.  We’re putting in the orderly liquidation authority from Dodd–Frank.  We’re working with our international partners.  And I hope that we’ll make 9 of 26 March 20, 2013  progress against too-big-to-fail, because I agree with her 100 percent that it’s a real problem and Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL needs to be addressed if at all possible.   

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Mr. Chairman, I’d like to change the subject a little.  Your predecessor served as Fed Chairman for 19 years.  By contrast, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have 8-year term limits on—for their top people.  I wanted to ask you two questions related to that.  First, as a matter of governance, do you think 8 years is the right amount of time for a central bank leader to serve, or should it be less or more, or undefined?  And, more specifically, as it regards to you, your term is 10 years from completion.  How are you thinking about what you will be doing next year after your term is completed?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, on the latter question, I don’t have anything for you.  I’ll certainly be informing the Wall Street Journal and other publications if I come to some In terms of term limits, I don’t have a strong view on that.  Different countries use different approaches.  Of course, the President always has the option to reappoint or not reappoint Fed Chairmen, and the Senate always has the option of confirming or not confirming.  So, in that respect, term limits are redundant.  And, indeed, if you had term limits on the Fed Chairman, that would be, I think, the only office in the federal government besides President and Vice President that would have that restriction.   But that being said, again, I don’t view this as a major issue, nor have I seen it actively discussed in, I think, in the Hill.  Perhaps I missed it.  But I don’t have a strong view about that.  My 10-year term, of course, is not as Chairman.  My 10-year remaining term is as a Governor, so that’s not relevant, really, to the question that you asked about.   10 of 26 March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.  I want to go back to asset purchases.  You’ve spoken a lot about the power of forward guidance, the power of clear communication.  I understand that it’s a complicated issue, but why would you leave on the table the additional power of saying to markets, “We’re going to keep doing this for a while”?  And, I wonder if you could tell us, when is the last time you spoke with someone who is unemployed?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Pretty recently.  I have a relative that is unemployed.  But I come from a small town in South Carolina that has taken a big hit from the recession.  Last time I was there, the unemployment rate was about 15 percent.  I think it’s better now.  The home that I was raised in had just been foreclosed upon when I was visiting there.  I have great concern about the unemployed both for their own sake, but also because the loss of skills, the loss of labor force attachment is bad for our whole economy.  It reduces tax revenues.  It reduces productivity.  So I think it’s very, very important that we act to address unemployment, and I think the Federal Reserve—I think most people would agree—the Federal Reserve has been fairly active in that regard.   In terms of costs, there are a number of different costs, and I mentioned some of them in my remarks.  I think one that has recently been discussed—Governor Stein brought it up in a speech—is the issue of financial stability.  Clearly, financial instability, if it were allowed to be sufficiently serious, would be a threat to employment, a threat to jobs, and a threat to production.  So, obviously, given the experience of the past few years, we want to be sure that we’re not unnecessarily encouraging excessive risk-taking or other problems in the financial markets.  We do address that through a number of means, including monitoring the financial system, regulation, supervision, communication, and the like.  But this is a potential concern that a 11 of 26 March 20, 2013  number of my colleagues are worried about, and it’s one of the things we talked about in our Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL discussion of the costs and risks of balance sheet policies.   

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Then why would you leave forward guidance on the table?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I don’t know what you mean by “on the table.”   

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Why not use it as a tool to increase the power of asset purchases?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, I don’t—we’ve not been able to come to an agreement about what guidance we should give.  And part of the concern is—is that as we go forward, we—you know, we’ll have to factor in the efficacy, which is another issue.  I mean, there’s a wide range of views about how effective asset purchases are in terms of moving the economy.  So, as we move forward in time, we’ll be learning about how effective the policy is, and what costs and risks there may be associated with it.  And, as we do that, perhaps we will be able to give more-explicit guidance.  And I agree with you 100 percent that that would be more effective if we could give numerical guidance.  But, you know, I think the Federal Reserve has come a long way.  You know, in 1994, we didn’t even tell people when we changed the federal funds rate.  Now, we’re telling you when—you know, what the state of the economy is going to be when we raise the federal funds rate.  So, we are making progress in terms of forward guidance.   

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Chairman, Donna Borak with American Banker.  There have been a number of policies that have been floated in the last few months regarding of strengthening U.S. banks, one being increased—perhaps making adjustments to the Basel III’s leverage ratio, requiring banks to hold long-term unsecured debt in the event of a resolution, and then, also, placing a cap on banks’ nondeposit liabilities.  Firstly, is—do you agree with these policies and 12 of 26 March 20, 2013  whether or not the Fed should be pursuing them along with supervisors?  And, secondly, in the Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL context of this question of too-big-to-fail, I mean, do you think these policies would actually help to finally convince the market and the public that too-big-to-fail doesn’t exist?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think capital is an important element in addressing too-big-to-fail.  One of the things that will be proposed, and is not in effect yet, will be surcharges on the largest banks—that is, the largest financial institutions will have to hold more capital as a percent of their risk-weighted assets than smaller banks do.  That will increase their cost of funding and, to some extent, will both equalize their cost of funding with other banks and make them safer so that the risk of their failure is limited.  So I think that’s an important step.  And there are many other restrictions in both Dodd–Frank and Basel, including liquidity restrictions and so on, that apply most strictly to the largest institutions.   In terms of the financing, it is true, I think, that excessive reliance on short-term uninsured funding does present some risks.  And there are different ways to address that.  But one way to address it is through liquidity regulation.  And both in our 165–166 rule and now through Basel III, we will be putting forward restrictions on the kinds of financing, the limits on how much illiquidity and liquidity risk firms can take.   Again, I don’t think too-big-to-fail is solved now.  We’re doing a number of things, which I think will help.  We need to keep assessing that, and we’ll be able to tell by looking at don’t achieve the goal, I think we’ll have to do additional steps.  It is important.  I mean, it’s not something we can just forget about.  It may take some time, but too-big-to-fail was a major part of the source of the crisis.  And we will not have successfully responded to the crisis if we don’t address that problem successfully.   13 of 26 March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

JEFF KEARNS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Jeff Kearns from Bloomberg.  Looking at the level for credit scores for new home loans rising into the 700s—is that something you would consider to be a successful transmission of monetary policy, and the—especially given how well the Fed says that banks are capitalized?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the tightening of credit in mortgage markets—I mean, our sense is that it’s gone too far.  I mean, some tightening was obviously needed.  There were people who bought houses prior to the crisis who really couldn’t sustain a mortgage.  So, terms and conditions have been tightened up, and we’re now seeing much higher credit quality requirements on potential borrowers.  We are concerned that a variety of factors, such as concerns about putbacks the banks may have, uncertainties about regulation—which we’re working on to get done as quickly as possible—may have tightened the mortgage credit box more than would be desirable in a long-run healthy economy.  That does have some effect on monetary policy.  One of the most powerful tools we have is bringing down mortgage rates and stimulating homebuying, construction, and related industries.  So that is an issue that we take into account.  I would say one thing, which is that as the housing industry has strengthened and home prices have gone up, that has actually brought some people into the credit box in the sense that the number of people, for example, who are underwater on their mortgages is declining as house prices go up.  So, as people have bigger down payments, bigger equity in their homes, they become more creditworthy.  So, to some extent, not—I don’t want to overstate it—but to some extent, monetary policy—by strengthening the housing market, helping support house prices—is bringing more people into the mortgage market.

PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes of Fox Business, sir.  The stock market has been hitting all-time highs.  It’s recovered all of its losses from the financial crisis.  I just want to know if I—14 of 26 March 20, 2013  from you, if I still have time to get in.  But seriously, how do you feel about that?  Is it good?  Is Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL it bad?  Mission accomplished?  And are you worried about bubbles?  We’re still at 7.7 percent unemployment.  I mean, is the—what do you think?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s right.  We’re not targeting asset prices.  We’re not measuring success in terms of the stock market.  We’re measuring success in terms of our mandate, which is employment and price stability, and that’s what we’re trying to achieve.  We do monitor the entire financial system, not just the parts that we supervise or regulate.  It includes the stock market and other asset markets.  We use a variety of metrics.  And I don’t want to, now, be pulled into going through every individual financial market and assessing it.  But, in the stock market, you know, we don’t see at this point anything that’s out of line with historical patterns.  In particular, you should remember, of course, that while the Dow may be hitting a high, it’s in nominal terms, it’s not in real terms.  And if you adjust for inflation and for the growth of the economy, you know, we’re still some distance from the high.  I don’t think it’s all that surprising that the stock market would rise, given that there has been increased optimism about the economy and the share of income going to profits has been very high.  Profit increases have been substantial, and the relationship between stock prices and earnings is not particularly unusual at this point.   Chairman, the statement mentions that fiscal policy has become more restrictive.  How much of a drag on growth do you see from the Social Security tax increase and the across-the-board spending cuts that went into effect on March 1?  And is it possible that the Fed might see a need to provide more support to the economy if that—because of that drag, the drag on fiscal?   15 of 26 March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, our analysis is fairly comparable to analysis that the Congressional Budget Office has presented to the Congress.  And they estimate that putting together all the fiscal measures, including the fiscal cliff deal, the sequester, and other cuts, that federal fiscal restraint in 2013 is cutting something like 1½ percentage points off of growth, which, of course, is very significant.  So, that is an issue for us.  We—you know, we take as given what the fiscal authorities are doing.  The economy is weaker.  Job creation is slower than it would be otherwise.  And so, that is one of the reasons that our policy has been as aggressive as it is.  That being said, as I’ve said many times, monetary policy cannot offset a fiscal restraint of that magnitude, and so the final outcome will be worse—or, in terms of jobs—than would have been the case with less fiscal restraint.  I want to emphasize that I do believe that long-term fiscal stability is extremely important.  And I urge Congress and the Administration, as I always do, when I go to testify to do whatever is necessary to put us on a sustainable fiscal path going forward.  But, in doing so, I think it’s a good idea to pay attention to the impact in the near term on what is still not a completely satisfactory recovery.   

[SECTION]

STEVE BECKNER.  Mr. Chairman, good afternoon.  You earlier stressed that you want to see improvement in the labor market sustained, and that to make that determination, you have to have adequate economic growth, and yet the projections in the revised Summary of Economic Projections has kind of a—it seems like an Okun’s law dilemma there.  You—they have reduced the projected rate of unemployment, but, at the same time, lowered the growth forecast.  So how do you square those two?  How do you get sustained improvement in the labor market if the economy is going to slow down?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, if in fact that happens, it’s an issue, obviously.  There’s been some disconnect, at least in the short run, between unemployment rate changes and 16 of 26 March 20, 2013  growth during this recovery, and there’ve been periods, at least, where unemployment has fallen Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL relatively quickly even though growth has been more limited.  So we’re just going to have to monitor developments in the economy and see what happens.  You’re right that we’re not forecasting extraordinarily strong growth.  But it is also true, as you—I think, you noted, that our projections for unemployment in the fourth quarter are noticeably lower than they were in improvement in the outlook, as measured by that metric.  But you’re right.  You know, we do need to see a sustained improvement.  One month, two months doesn’t cut it.  And, normally, you would expect that you would need to see a reasonable pace of GDP growth in order to achieve that.  So we’re just going to have to keep providing support for the economy and see—you know, see how things evolve.

VICTORIA McGRANE.  Hi, Chairman.  Victoria McGrane with the Dow Jones Newswires.  In the stress test that the Fed recently conducted, there were an adverse scenario and a severely adverse scenario, and you published results of the—from the individual banks on—under the adverse—severely adverse scenario.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.   

[SECTION]

VICTORIA McGRANE.  But you didn’t under the merely adverse scenario, which featured an inflation shock followed by a quick rise in short-term rates.  So, I have a two-part question.  First, why didn’t the Fed publish those results?  And, second, even if you can’t share how individual banks performed, what did you learn from how—from the results you did see under that adverse scenario?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the reason for publishing the severely adverse scenario, of course, is that’s the ultimate acid test, you know, whether the banks are sufficiently 17 of 26 March 20, 2013  capitalized.  Presumably, if they can survive a severely adverse scenario, then an adverse Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL scenario would—obviously less strenuous, less stressful, and they wouldn’t have as much difficulty.  So, I think, in terms of evaluating the health of the banks, the severely adverse scenario is the right one.  That being said, I don’t see any principle reason why we couldn’t provide that information.  I will find out at some point why we are doing it that way.   The severely adverse scenario is mostly just a scaling-up of the adverse scenario, for the most part.  There are some differences.  For example, we have used some of our work to look at interest rate risk and interest rate sensitivity and, you know, found generally that banks can also sustain a significant increase in long-term interest rates as well for a number of reasons, one of them being that higher interest rates increase their franchise value because it increases their net interest margin over time.  So, again, I think the severely adverse scenario is the one that really puts them to the test.  But we’re always talking about, you know, what information will be useful to investors and to the press.

RYAN AVENT.  Ryan Avent, The Economist.  You’ve noted that most of the Committee members don’t expect an increase in rates until 2015 or 2016, and it looks, in the projections, as though the expectation for the long-run rate of the federal funds target is around 4 percent, which would be below the sort of peak rate we saw before the recession.  Given the Committee’s concerns about unconventional policy, is there any feeling on the Committee that perhaps recovery isn’t going fast enough, and that more accommodation would be justified?  And has there been any discussion about a change in policy targets to try to stay effective without much of a cushion there between the fed funds target rate and the zero lower bound?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as you point out, we’re at the zero lower bound, and that makes further accommodation not impossible but more difficult and harder to predict, and 18 of 26 March 20, 2013  with more side effects that are difficult to predict.  I’m not sure I understand the whole thrust of Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL your question.  We have—as you know, we have given this guideline for—so we call them signposts for how the funds rate is going to evolve over time.  And, as a lot of academic research shows, you know, when you’re close to the zero lower bound, by telling markets that you’re going to keep rates low for a significant period, that’s one way to get longer-term rates down and to provide more stimulus to the economy.  And we think this has been a pretty effective tool.  Now, we could go further.  We could lower even further, say, the unemployment rate number that we hit.  We’ve discussed variants, and at least one member of the Committee has suggested that.  But for right now, we find that the thresholds that we have put into that rate guidance seem to be sufficient to approximate the—what’s called the optimal control path of interest rates, that it seems to give a path of unemployment and inflation that’s about as good as we can get with the monetary policy tools that we have.  It doesn’t mean we’re satisfied.  It just means that we don’t have enough fire power to get the economy back to full employment more quickly.  I don’t know if that was responsive or not.   

[SECTION]

RYAN AVENT.  I guess I’m not—given the concerns about unconventional policy relative to normal interest rate policy, is there a feeling that more should be done so that when the next potential recession rolls around, we have more room to cut rates, or are you comfortable just using these threshold policies on an ongoing basis?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I see.  So you’re talking about the inflation target, basically.  Is that fair?   

[SECTION]

RYAN AVENT.  Yes, I think so.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, okay.  So, historically, the argument for having inflation greater than zero—we define price stability as 2 percent inflation, as do most central 19 of 26 March 20, 2013  banks around the world.  And one might ask, “Well, price stability should be zero inflation.  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL Why do you choose 2 percent instead of zero?”  And the answer is, the question you’re raising, which is that if you have zero inflation, you’re very close to the deflation zone, and nominal interest rates will be so low that it would be very difficult to respond fully to recessions.  And so, historical experience has suggested that 2 percent is an appropriate balance between the cost of inflation and the cost that you’re referring to.  We haven’t contemplated changing that.  We just put that number in, as you know, fairly recently.  I think at this point, it’s still being debated in academic circles that—you know, and we’ll see what kind of outcome they come up with.  But it’s an interesting question to try to quantify.  There is research, for example, which asks the question, how often do you tend to hit the zero lower bound?  And our belief a few years ago was that it was a very rare event, and now it’s become more common.  So I’m sure there’ll be a lot of thinking about this in academic and other circles.   

[SECTION]

BEN WEYL.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Ben Weyl, Congressional Quarterly.  There’s a lot of talk about whether certain institutions are too big to fail.  And I wanted to get at a different, if related, question.  In 1980, let’s say, there was about—the financial sector comprised about 5 percent of the U.S. economy, U.S. GDP; now it’s about 9 percent.  And I’m wondering if you think that shift is beneficial to the U.S. economy?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I don’t think I know the answer to that question.  Certainly, the financial system has—I could argue two ways.  I could say, well, the U.S. economy grew pretty well between 1945 and 1975 or 1980.  And the financial system was much simpler and didn’t have a lot of exotic derivatives and so on.  So that would be—that would be one way to argue that maybe, you know, all of this extra financial activity is not justified.  On the other hand, the world is a lot more complicated.  We’re a lot—the world is a lot more international.  20 of 26 March 20, 2013  You have large multinational firms that are connecting resources, savers, and investors in Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL different countries.  There’s a lot more demand for risk sharing, for liquidity services, and so on.  So, I think, based on that and based on the innovations that information technology have created in lots of industries, you would expect financial services to be somewhat bigger.  So I don’t really know the answer to that question.  I think that my predecessor Paul Volcker’s claim that the only contribution to the financial industry is the automatic teller machine might be a little exaggerated.  I know that people—some people have that view.  Again, I don’t know the answer.  I think that a somewhat bigger financial sector can be justified by the wider range of services and the more globalized financial economic system that we have.  But the exact number, I can’t really say.

JEREMY TORDJMAN.  Hi, I’m Jeremy Tordjman with the AFP Newswire Agency.  I have a follow-up question on Cyprus.  As a central banker, do you think it was either appropriate or fair to impose a levy on every bank deposit in Cyprus, even those insured by the European Union itself?  Thank you.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I have not been involved in those conversations and I don’t necessarily know all the details, and so I know they’re grappling with a very difficult problem.  I think the issue they face is that there’s a pretty big hole, a financial hole, in the sense that there is a fiscal issue and there’s also a bank restructuring recapitalization issue.  So, they’re looking for resources where they can find them.  I think everyone understands that there are certain risks with that besides the equity issue of taxing lower-income people.  There is the issue of setting a precedent that might reduce confidence in banks in subsequent periods.  But again, that being said, it’s a very tough issue.  And I—and finding the resources to solve Cyprus’s 21 of 26 March 20, 2013  problem, you know, there’s probably no easy way to do it.  And we’re going to keep monitoring Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL that.  But I don’t envy them that particular challenge.   

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  There’s been a trend in the last couple of years where the economy kind of jumped out of the gate in the first part of the year only to kind of falter.  Is that something that you’re worried about this year?  And does that suggest that QE might have to stay kind of at the same pace you are now and some into the third quarter until we’re sure about that—that trend?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, you’re absolutely right that there’s been a certain tendency for a spring slump that we’ve seen a few times.  One possible explanation for that—besides some freaky things, some weather events and so on, one possible explanation is seasonality.  Because of the severity of the recession in 2007 to 2009, the seasonals got distorted.  And they may have led—and I say “may” because the statistical experts—many of them deny it, but it’s possible that they led job creation and GDP to be exaggerated to some extent early in the year.  Our assessment is, though, that at this point, that we’re far enough away from the recession that those seasonal factors ought to be pretty much washing out by now.  So if we do, in fact, see a slump, it would probably be due to real fundamental causes and then we would obviously have to respond to that.  As I said, we’re planning to adjust our tools to respond to changes in the outlook, and that can go either direction.   

[SECTION]

DONALD JUDD.  Donald Judd, CBS News.  I was wondering if you could tell me how, if a run on the banks happens in Cyprus, how that might affect U.S. markets.  And also, is it possible for the U.S. to levy a tax on regular deposits here, or why not?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as someone mentioned, Cyprus is a tiny economy, and I don’t think that these issues, as worrisome as they are and as concerned as we would be for 22 of 26 March 20, 2013  the Cypriote people, I don’t think that they have direct implications for the U.S. economy.  The Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL only way that they would create a problem would be if the runs became contagious in some sense, if depositors in other countries lost confidence.  But at this point, I’m not aware of any evidence that that is, in fact, the case.  The argument the Europeans are making is that Cyprus is a very unique situation, very different situation.  And, indeed, it is quite unusual to have a banking sector as large as they have relative to their economy.  In terms of the United States, you know, the FDIC was founded, I think, in 1934, and insured deposits, and they’re very proud of the fact that no one’s ever lost a dime in insured deposits.  And, during the crisis, the response of the government was, in fact, to increase the level of, you know, depositor account sizes that were insured.  So I consider that to be extremely unlikely in the United States.   

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Don Lee at the L.A. Times.  Would you be in favor of reducing the flow of stimulus if we had another month or two, as we did in February, of job growth and the unemployment rate dropping, but the long-term unemployed didn’t change much?  And, on a related question, how much of a pickup do you expect to see in the labor force participation rate, and what will we need to see there for that to show substantial improvement?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  On the first question, as I said, I mean that’s a decision for the Committee.  We’re going to have to make a judgment about how significant the improvement is, how sustained it is.  Long-term unemployment is one dimension of the unemployment problem.  But I think that probably the best way to get the long-term unemployed back to work is to get an overall strong labor market.  And I think that’s—we’d be looking at the overall key indicators like overall unemployment rate, payrolls and hiring, and some of the other things that I mentioned.  The other part of your question was about— 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Labor force. 23 of 26 March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Labor force participation, yes.  Labor force participation has been declining on a trend-like basis in the United States for a while.  That’s the result, mostly, of demographic factors, partly the aging of the population, partly the fact that female participation is no longer increasing—it’s in fact decreasing a little bit.  It’s also the case that labor force attachment within people of working age has declined for a number of different reasons.  So there’s a trend underlying this.  And, in addition, there are probably some people who’ve left the labor force just because they are discouraged and they can’t find work.  So, as the economy strengthens, the labor market strengthens, I would expect to see some of these folks coming back into the labor force.  For example, the number of people who are out of the labor force but say they would like a full-time job but are not actually counted as unemployed, that number has actually been going up, which suggests that there are more people thinking about going back into the labor force, going back to work.  But I doubt that, in the near term at least, that we’ll see an increase in labor force participation because—besides the effects of the slow recovery, high unemployment, we’ve had a downward trend in the U.S., which is not due to the recession, it’s due to underlying demographic factors.   

[SECTION]

CATHERINE HOLLANDER.  Catherine Hollander from National Journal.  You argued in a 1999 paper and a 2002 speech that monetary policy was not the right tool for addressing asset bubbles.  But in January, you suggested that there might be a role for it, even if not as the first line of defense.  Has your thinking on the issue evolved, and can you explain why?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I still believe the following, which is that monetary policy is a very blunt instrument.  If you are raising interest rates to pop an asset bubble, even if you were sure you can do that, you might, at the same time, be throwing the economy into recession, which kind of defeats the purpose of monetary policy.  And therefore, I think the first 24 of 26 March 20, 2013  line of defense—I mean, I think, we have a sort of a tripartite line of defense.  We start off with Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL very extensive and sophisticated monitoring at a much higher level and much more comprehensively than we’ve had in the past.  Then we have supervision and regulation, where we work with other agencies to try to cover all the empty or uncovered areas in the financial system.  And then, in addition, we try to use communication and similar tools to affect the way that financial markets respond to monetary policy.  So we do have some first lines of defense, which I think should be used first.  That being said, you know, I think that given the problems that we’ve had—not just in the United States, but globally in the last 15, 20 years—that we need to at least take into account these issues as we make monetary policy.  And I think most of the people on the FOMC would agree with that.  What that means exactly depends on the circumstances.  I think if the economy is in very weak condition and interest rates are very low for that purpose, it’s very difficult to contemplate raising rates a lot because you’re concerned about some sector in the financial sphere.  On the other hand, if you’re in an expansion and there’s a credit boom going on, that—the case in that situation for making policy a little bit tighter might be better.  So, as I’ve said many times, I have an open mind in this question.  We’re learning; all central bankers are learning.  But I think I still would agree with the point I made in my very first speech in 2002, as a Governor at the Federal Reserve, where I argued that the first line of defense ought to be the more targeted tools that we have, including regulatory tools and, to some extent, macroprudential tools like some emerging markets use.

PETER COOK.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As tempted as I might be to end with your NCAA picks or your view of the Nationals, I have something a little more serious for you, in line with what John asked you about—your future.  Given the unprecedented nature of Fed policy on your watch and the uncertainty surrounding the exit strategy, to what extent do you feel 25 of 26 March 20, 2013  personally responsible to be at the helm when those decisions are made, and how does that affect Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL your future?  And, more specifically, sir, the last time we gathered here at the press conference, you were asked if you’d spoken with the President about your future, and you said you hadn’t at that time.  Could you at least tell us if you’ve had the conversation?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I’ve spoken to the President a bit, but I really don’t have any—I don’t really have any information for you at this juncture.  I don’t think that I’m the only person in the world who can manage the exit.  In fact, one of the things that I hope to accomplish, and was not entirely successful at, as the Governor or as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, was to try to depersonalize, to some extent, monetary policy and financial policy and to get broader recognition of the fact that this is an extraordinary institution.  It has a large number of very high quality policymakers.  It has a terrific staff—literally dozens of Ph.D. economists who’ve been working through the crisis, trying to understand these issues and implement our policy tools, and there’s no single person who is essential to that.  But, again, with respect to my personal plans, I will certainly let you know when I have something more concrete.   Thank you.   26 of 26",Ben Bernanke,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
9,2013-06-19,"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon.   The Federal Open Market Committee concluded a two-day meeting earlier today.  Based on its review of recent economic and financial developments, the Committee sees the economy continuing to grow at a moderate pace, notwithstanding the strong headwinds created by current federal fiscal policies.  The labor market has continued to improve, with gains in private payroll employment averaging about 200,000 jobs per month over the past six months.  Job gains, along with the strengthening housing market, have in turn contributed to increases in consumer confidence and supported household spending.  However, at 7.6 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated, as do rates of underemployment and long-term unemployment.  Overall, the Committee believes the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market have diminished since the fall, but we will continue to evaluate economic conditions and risks as they evolve.  Inflation has been running below the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent for some time and has been a bit softer recently.  The Committee believes that the recent softness partly reflects transitory factors, and with longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable, the Committee expects inflation to move back towards this 2 percent longer-term objective over time.  We will, however, be closely monitoring these developments as well.  In conjunction with this meeting, the 19 participants in our policy discussion—the 7 Board members and the 12 Reserve Bank presidents—submitted individual economic projections.  As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.  Generally, the projections of individual participants show they expect moderate growth, picking up over time, and gradual progress towards levels of  1 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL unemployment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability.   In brief, participants’ projections for economic growth have a central tendency of 2.3 to 2.6 percent for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.6 percent in 2015.  The central tendency of their projections of the unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of this year is 7.2 to 7.3 percent, gradually increasing from its current low level toward the Committee’s longer-run objective; the central tendency of their projections for inflation is 0.8 to 1.2 percent for this year and 1.6 to 2.0 percent for 2015.   Before turning to today’s policy decision, let me say a few words about the Federal Reserve’s strategy for normalizing policy in the long run.  In the minutes of its June 2011 meeting, the Committee set forth principles that it intended to follow when the time came to normalize policy and the size and the structure of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  As part of prudent planning, we have been reviewing these principles in recent meetings.  We expect those discussions to continue and intend to provide further information at an appropriate time.  For today, I will note that, in the view of most participants, the broad principles set out in June 2011 remain applicable.  One difference is worth mentioning.  While participants continue to think that, in the long run, the Federal Reserve’s portfolio should consist predominantly of Treasury securities, a strong majority now expects that the Committee will not sell agency mortgage-backed securities during the process of normalizing monetary policy, although in the longer run, limited sales could be used to reduce or eliminate residual MBS holdings.  I emphasize that, given the outlook and the Committee’s policy guidance, these matters are unlikely to be relevant to actual policy for quite a while.    2 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL Let me turn now to current policy issues.  With unemployment still elevated and inflation below the Committee’s longer-run objective, the Committee is continuing its highly accommodative policies.  As you know, in normal times, the Committee eases monetary policy by lowering the target for the short-term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate.  However, the target range for the federal funds rate, currently at 0 to ¼ percent, cannot meaningfully be reduced further.  Thus, we are providing policy accommodation through two alternative methods:  first, by communicating to the public the Committee’s plans for setting the federal funds rate target over the medium term, and, second, by purchasing and holding Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities.  Let me discuss a few key points regarding each of these two policy tools.   First, today the Committee reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low range for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent so long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved in the senses described in the FOMC statement.  As I have noted frequently, the phrase “at least as long” in the Committee’s interest rate guidance is important.  The economic conditions we have set out as preceding any future rate increase are thresholds, not triggers.  For example, assuming that inflation is near our objective at that time, as expected, a decline in the unemployment rate to 6½ percent would not lead automatically to an increase in the federal funds rate target, but rather would indicate only that it was appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook justified such an increase.  All else equal, the more subdued the outlook for inflation at that time, the more patient the Committee would likely be in making that assessment.  In the projections submitted for this meeting, 14 of 19 FOMC participants indicated that they expect the first increase in the target for the federal funds rate to occur in 2015, and one  3 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL expected the first increase to incur in 2016.  Moreover, so long as the economy remains short of maximum employment, inflation remains near our longer-run objective, and inflation expectations remain well anchored, increases in the target for the federal funds rate, once they begin, are likely to be gradual, consistent with the Committee’s balanced approach to meeting its employment and price stability objectives.   The purpose of this forward guidance about policy is to assure households and businesses that monetary policy will continue to support the recovery even as the pace of economic growth and job creation picks up.  Importantly, as our statement notes, the Committee expects a considerable interval of time to pass between when the Committee will cease adding accommodation through asset purchases and the time when the Committee will begin to reduce accommodation by moving the federal funds rate target toward more normal levels.   The second policy tool being employed by the Committee is asset purchases.  Specifically, the Committee has been purchasing $40 billion per month in agency mortgage-backed securities and $45 billion per month in Treasury securities.  When our program of asset purchases was initiated last September, the Committee stated the goal of promoting a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in the context of price stability and noted it would also be taking appropriate account of the efficacy and costs of the program.  Today the Committee made no changes to the purchase program.   Although the Committee left the pace of purchases unchanged at today’s meeting, it has stated that it may vary the pace of purchases as economic conditions evolve.  Any such change would reflect the incoming data and their implications for the outlook, as well as the cumulative progress made toward the Committee’s objectives since the program began in September.  Going forward, the economic outcomes that the Committee sees as most likely involve continuing gains  4 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL in labor markets, supported by moderate growth that picks up over the next several quarters as the near-term restraint from fiscal policy and other headwinds diminishes.  We also see inflation moving back toward our 2 percent objective over time.  If the incoming data are broadly consistent with this forecast, the Committee currently anticipates that it would be appropriate to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year.  And if the subsequent data remain broadly aligned with our current expectations for the economy, we would continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around midyear.  In this scenario, when asset purchases ultimately come to an end, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7 percent, with solid economic growth supporting further job gains, a substantial improvement from the 8.1 percent unemployment rate that prevailed when the Committee announced this program.   I would like to emphasize once more the point that our policy is in no way predetermined and will depend on the incoming data and the evolution of the outlook as well as on the cumulative progress toward our objectives.  If conditions improve faster than expected, the pace of asset purchases could be reduced somewhat more quickly.  If the outlook becomes less favorable, on the other hand, or if financial conditions are judged to be inconsistent with further progress in the labor markets, reductions in the pace of purchases could be delayed.  Indeed, should it be needed, the Committee would be prepared to employ all of its tools, including an increase in the pace of purchases for a time, to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability.   It’s also worth noting here that, even if a modest reduction in the pace of asset purchases occurs, we would not be shrinking the Federal Reserve’s portfolio of securities, but only slowing the pace at which we are adding to the portfolio while continuing to reinvest principal payments  5 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL and proceeds from maturing holdings as well.  These large and growing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.  To use the analogy of driving an automobile, any slowing in the pace of purchases will be akin to letting up a bit on the gas pedal as the car picks up speed, not to beginning to apply the brakes.   I will close by drawing again the important distinction between the Committee’s target for the federal funds rate.  As I mentioned, the current level of the federal funds rate target is likely to remain appropriate for a considerable period after asset purchases are concluded.  To return to the driving analogy, if the incoming data support the view that the economy is able to sustain a reasonable cruising speed, we will ease the pressure on the accelerator by gradually reducing the pace of purchases.  However, any need to consider applying the brakes by raising short-term rates is still far in the future.  In any case, no matter how conditions may evolve, the Federal Reserve remains committed to fostering substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability. Thank you.  I’d be glad to take your questions.   

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman with CNBC.  I hate to use my question to ask you to clarify something, but when you said gradually reduce purchases, beginning later this year and ending it next year when the unemployment rate hits 7 percent—what is that?  Is that a decision by the FOMC?  Is that an intention that— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That is—we had a good discussion of that issue today, and we haven’t had—obviously, there’s no change, there’s no change in policy involved here, there’s simply a clarification, helping people to think about where policy will evolve.  So, it was thought that it might be best for me to explain that to this group and answer questions.  Future policy  6 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL statements may include elements of this, but it’s not a policy change.  I’m just trying to explain how are—how we’re making a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, how we’re making that concrete, and how we’re thinking about the potential future of the program given alternative policy and economic developments. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  So there is no consensus on that?  That’s not a vote of the FOMC, that’s not a plan that’s written down some place or—? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It represents the consensus of the FOMC, yes. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  If you could just—the question I was going to ask was, could you give us some information on “substantial improvement”?  Is that the unemployment rate coming down by itself to 7 percent, or are there other factors involved, and is it “substantial” compared to the fall?  Is that when— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, there are many factors that we look at when trying to judge the state of the labor market.  As you know, we look at participation, payrolls, a variety of other data, but the 7 percent unemployment rate is indicative of the kind of progress we’d like to make in order to be able to say that we’ve reached substantial progress. 

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Mr. Chairman, there’s an undercurrent of optimism in your forecast and your statement—in the policy statement today.  For instance, the unemployment rate forecast comes down to 6.5 to 6.8 percent next year.  It’s the case that the Fed has overestimated the economy’s growth rate very often in the past during this recovery, so—and we’ve gone through a period in the first half of the year with pretty subdued growth.  So I would like to hear you explain where this optimism comes from and how confident you are that these expectations are going to be met.  7 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the fundamentals look a little better to us.  In particular, the housing sector, which has been a drag on growth since the crisis, is now, obviously, a support to growth.  It’s not only creating construction jobs, but as house prices rise, increased household wealth supports consumption spending, consumer sentiment.  State and local governments, who have been a major drag, are now coming to a position where they no longer have to lay off large numbers of workers.  Generally speaking, financial conditions are improving.  The main drag, or the main headwind, to growth this year is, as you know, is the federal fiscal policy, which the CBO estimates is something on the order of 1½ percentage points of growth.  And our judgment is that, you know, given that very heavy headwind, the fact that the economy is still moving ahead at at least a moderate pace, is indicative that the underlying factors are improving.  And so we’ll see how that evolves.  Obviously, we haven’t seen the full effect yet of the fiscal policy changes; we’ll want to see how that evolves as we get through that fiscal impact.  But we’re hopeful, as you can see from the individual projections—and again, these are individual projections, not an official forecast of the Committee—we’ll be obviously very interested to see if the economy does pick up a bit and continue to reduce unemployment, as we anticipate.  I think one thing that’s very important for me to say is that, if you draw the conclusion that I’ve just said, that our policies—that our purchases will end in the middle of next year, you’ve drawn the wrong conclusion because our purchases are tied to what happens in the economy.  And if the Federal Reserve makes the same error and we overestimate what’s happening, then our policies will adjust to that.  We are not—we have no deterministic or fixed plan.  Rather, our policies are going to depend on this scenario coming true.  If it doesn’t come true, we’ll adjust our policies to that.  8 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL

ALISTER BULL.  Alister Bull from Reuters.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Financial conditions have tightened in the last few weeks and bond yields have gone up, and they’ve gone up again today.  Why do you think that is?  And could you talk a little bit about whether that rise in bond yields and interest—longer-term interest rates could affect your economic outlook and, particularly, given that mortgage rates are now back up above 4 percent, if that could affect the recovery under way in the housing market? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, that’s a good question.  Yes, rates have come up some.  That’s in part due to more optimism, I think, about the economy.  It’s in part due to perceptions of the Federal Reserve.  The forecast—the projections that our participants submitted for this meeting, of course, were done in the last few days, so they were done with full knowledge of what had happened to financial conditions.  Rates have tightened some, but, you know, other factors have been more positive—increasing house prices, for example.  I think as far as the housing market is concerned, we’re going to want to watch that, but one important difference now is that people are more optimistic about housing.  They expect house prices to continue to rise, and we see that, for example, in a survey question in the Michigan survey.  And that, you know, compensates to some extent for a slightly higher mortgage rate.  And, in fact, in terms of monthly payments on an average house, the change in mortgage rates we’ve seen so far is not all that dramatic.  So, yes, our forecast—our projections do factor that in, and if interest rates go up for the right reasons—that is, both optimism about the economy and an accurate assessment of monetary policy—that’s a good thing.  That’s not a bad thing. 

[SECTION]

ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times.  Mr. Chairman, you’ve always argued that it’s the stock of assets that the Federal Reserve holds which affects long-term interest rates.  How do you reconcile that with a very sharp rise in real interest rates that we’ve  9 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL seen in recent weeks?  And do you think the market is correctly interpreting what you think is most likely to be the future path of the Federal Reserve’s stock of assets?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we were a little puzzled by that.  It was bigger than can be explained I think by changes in the ultimate stock of asset purchases within reasonable ranges.  So I think we have to conclude that there are other factors at work as well, including, again, some optimism about the economy, maybe some uncertainty arising.  So, I’m agreeing with you that it seems larger than can be explained by a changing view of monetary policy.   It’s difficult to judge whether the markets are in sync or not.  Generally speaking though, I think that what I’ve seen from analysts and market participants is not wildly different from what, you know, the Committee is thinking and trying to—as I try today to communicate.  I think the most important thing that I just want to convey, again, is that it’s important not to say “this date, that date, this time,” it’s important to understand that our policies are economic dependent and, in particular, if financial conditions move in a way that make this economic scenario unlikely, for example, then that would be a reason for us to adjust our policy.

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Greetings, Mr. Chairman.  Craig Torres from Bloomberg.  I’d like to push for a little deeper explanation on thresholds and triggers. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure. 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  The forecast and the mysterious dots kind of don’t map into the unemployment forecast.  We see more-gradual rate rise going out into time.  People moving to the right, at least one person, on when they expect the rate to increase, and yet, unemployment’s going to fall to 6.5 percent in 2014.  I also note that labor force participation isn’t in that great shape, and you, in fact, have been a big believer that a lot of the exit from the workforce is related to weak demand, not structural factors.  So here is my question.  Can you explain a little bit more—you know—maybe is the threshold too high?  And I’ll point out that the Vice Chair and two other people who used to work here have done significant research on, maybe you need to let the employment rate fall much lower to pull these people back into the labor force.  So I’m wondering if you can expand on that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it’s a great question and—but the—what you pointed out, the difference between the little dots and the forecast actually illustrates the point, which is, remember, the 6½ percent is a threshold, not a trigger.  In other words, when we get to that point, we will then at that point begin to, you know, look at whether an increase in rates is appropriate, and among the things we would take into account, first of all, is inflation, and inflation obviously is very low and expected to stay low.  Secondly, we would be taking into account, does that unemployment rate fairly represent in some sense the state of the labor market?  And, as you pointed out, we have underemployment, part-time work, people leaving the labor force, reduced participation, long-term unemployment, a number of factors which suggest that maybe the 6.5 percent is a little bit—not exactly representative of the state of the labor market at that point.   11 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL So, first of all, since it is a threshold and not a trigger, we’re entirely free to take all that into account before we begin the process of raising rates, and that’s what the diagram suggests.  People are saying that unemployment will be at 6.5 in late 2014 or early 2015, but they’re saying that increases in rates may not follow but several quarters after that.  In terms of adjusting the threshold, I think that’s something that might happen.  If it did happen, it would be to lower it, I’m sure, not to raise it. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, New York Times.  Following up on that, so I understand the 6.5 percent is a threshold, but you’ve just talked about a 7 percent line for asset purchases.  That sounded less like a threshold than like a target.  You said if you’re at about that level, you’ll stop with the asset purchases mid next year.  You talked about wanting to see substantial improvement in the labor market before you did suspend those purchases.  It’s very easy to imagine a situation in which we get to 7 percent without seeing labor force participation increase.  The employment rate’s been at the same level for three years now.  Has something changed in your thinking about the value of asset purchases?  Why are you cutting them off before you see that “substantial improvement”? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, “substantial” is in the eye of the beholder.  I think going from 8.1 percent and a stagnant rate of improvement to 7 percent and stronger economic growth is a substantial increase.  I think it’s important to explain that, you know, we view ourselves as having two tools.  One of them is rate policy, and that includes both setting the rate and providing guidance about future rates.  That’s our basic tool, that’s the one that the Federal Reserve and other central banks have used forever.  Asset purchases are a different kind of thing.  They’re unconventional policy, they come with certain risks and certain uncertainties that are not necessarily associated with rate policy.  So our intent from the beginning, as I’ve been very clear,  12 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL was to use asset purchases as a way of achieving some near-term momentum to get the economy moving forward into a sustainable recovery.  And then, essentially, to allow the low interest rate policy which—to carry us through.  So what I—so let me just make two, I think, very important points.  The first is, our target is not 7, it’s not 6½, our target is maximum employment, which, according to our projections, most people on the Committee think is somewhere between 5 and 6 percent unemployment, and that’s where we’re trying to get to.  The 7, the 6½—these are guide posts that tell you how we’re going to be shifting the mix of our tools as we try to land this ship on a, you know, on a—in a smooth way onto the aircraft carrier.  The—sorry.  So, the other thing I wanted to say was that stopping asset purchases, when that happens, and I think we’re still some distance from that happening, but when that happens, that won’t involve ending the stimulus from asset purchases because we’re going to hold on to that portfolio.  And if the stock theory of the portfolio is correct, which we believe it is, holding all of those securities off of the continue to put downward pressure on interest rates.  And so, between our commitments to a low federal funds rate and the large portfolio, we will still be producing a very large amount of stimulus—in our view, enough to bring the economy smoothly towards full employment without incurring unnecessary costs or risks. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA McGRANE.  Hi, Chairman.  Victoria McGrane with Dow Jones Newswires.  You, in your statement before the press conference and in the policy statement, acknowledge that inflation readings have been low.  But you maintain that inflation expect—longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.  But actually, certain bond market measures of these things have fallen in recent weeks.  Is that of any concern, and if not, why?  What would you need to  13 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL see for the Committee to start being more concerned that longer-term inflation expectations are, in fact, falling? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, this is something we watch very carefully.  There are a number of, as I mentioned in the statement, there are a number of transitory factors that may be contributing to the very low inflation rate.  For example, the effects of the sequester on medical payments, the fact that nonmarket prices are extraordinarily low right now.  So these are some things that we expect to reverse and we expect to see inflation come up a bit.  But, first, on inflation expectations, it is true that the breakevens from the inflation-adjusted—inflation-indexed bonds have come down.  To this point, they still remain within the historical range that we’ve seen over the past few years.  And moreover, other measures of inflation expectations, be it forecasts by professional forecasters, whether it’s survey measures from firms or households, those are all still pretty much in the same places they were.   Now that being said, and as I said in my opening remarks, we don’t take anything for granted.  And one of the preconditions for the policy path that I described is that inflation begin, at least gradually, to return towards our 2 percent objective.  If that doesn’t happen, we will obviously have to take some measures to address that.  And we are certainly determined to keep inflation not only—we want to keep inflation near its objective, not only avoiding inflation that’s too high, but we also want to avoid inflation that’s too low. 

[SECTION]

PETER COOK.  Mr. Chairman, Peter Cook with Bloomberg Television.  Given the volatility we’ve seen in the market since your comments of May 22nd, the lengths to which you are stressing the forward guidance here today, it does suggest that there are some out there you’re worried are not getting your message right now.  And I’m wondering, to what extent do  14 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL you think now that your exit strategy is going to be that much more challenging because even in this small period of time when you haven’t done all that much, you’ve seen this kind of reaction? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it is important for us to communicate.  It’s particularly important when we have an unusual economic situation where I think the standard relationships are not applying in the way they have, where we’re using unconventional tools, where we’re using forward guidance.  So, I guess I agree with you that our communication is going to be very important.  We hope that the—again, the key point I’ve tried to make today is that our policies are tied to how the outlook evolves.  And that should provide some comfort to necessary.  If the economy does not improve along the lines that we expect, we’ll provide additional support.  If financial conditions evolve in a way that’s inconsistent with economic recovery, we will provide support.  But we’re hope—and in that way, we hope to increase confidence both among market participants, but also among investors and private consumers and other people in the economy.  So, but again, I mean, your point is well taken that we are in a position where the simple adjustment by 25 basis points to the federal funds rate seems like a long-ago experience, and we are in a more complex type of situation.  But we are determined to be as clear as we can, and we hope that you and your listeners and the markets will all be able to follow what we’re saying. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak with American Banker.  Next month will be the three-year anniversary of the Dodd–Frank Act, and, as you know, there are a number of significant rulemakings that have left to be finalized:  the Volcker rule, prudential regulations under section 165 and 166, and risk retention, to name a few.  Can you provide us with an update on where we  15 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL stand with the rulemakings?  And also, are you still optimistic that we will see these rules completed by the end of this year? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It’s certainly true that it’s taken time to do these regulations.  There are a number of reasons for that.  The first is that they are, inherently, many of them, quite complicated.  The Volcker rule, for example, involves some very subtle distinctions between hedging and market making and proprietary trading.  The second reason is that many of them involve multiple agencies, which have to coordinate, cooperate, and agree on language.  I think the QRM rule is, six agencies are involved in making that rule.  And the third fact—the third and basic issue is that we really have to do our homework.  We have to get these right, and that means having extended comment periods, getting lots of information from the public.  And then, you know, reviewing those comments and doing all we can to make sure we’re responsive to those many, many concerns and suggestions.  So it does take time.  I think it’s a little unfair to say, “Well, only 30 percent of the rules have been completed,” because most of the rules, even if they haven’t been completed, are now very far advanced, and that’s true for the major rules.  We are very close, for example, to completing Basel III.  We have made a good bit of progress on the Volcker rule, and I do anticipate that being done this year.  We are making additional progress on our 165, 166 advisory rules on the capital surcharges.  These are all things that will be coming relatively soon, at least during, you know, the current year.  And of course, once they are out there, then it will still take some time to be implemented, for financial institutions to change their practices, and so on—and so on.  I would also emphasize, though, that, even as this is going on, that we are not ignoring the health and safety of the banking system.  For example, I mean, since 2009, we’ve been doing these very rigorous stress tests, which are part of the Dodd–Frank rules.  And the amount of capital that U.S. banks hold has  16 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL roughly doubled—the largest banks—since 2009.  And indeed, the largest banks now appear, most of them, either to be Basel III–compliant or pretty close to Basel III–compliant.  So we are working with the banks to ensure their safety, to help them move in the directions that they know they’re going to have to be going even as the rules themselves are being finalized.  So, it’s an ongoing process, but I expect to see, you know, more-rapid completion, you know, going forward in the next few quarters. 

[SECTION]

PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes, Fox Business.  Sir, one of the highlights of the Kansas City Fed conference in Jackson Hole every year are remarks by the Chairman, you.  You’re not going this year.  We’ve heard it’s because you have a conflict in your personal schedule.  But some have read—taken that as a sign that you may not be staying on the job for another term.  Could you comment on that?  And could you offer us—give us a little more explanation as to why you’re not going to be in Jackson Hole for the first time? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as I’ve said, I’m not going to comment on my personal plans, but I will say this.  I think there’s a perception that the Jackson Hole conference is a Federal Reserve Systemwide conference.  It’s not.  It’s a conference sponsored by one of the 12 Reserve Banks.  Every one of the 12 Reserve Banks has conferences, has meetings, and this is the one I’ve gone to the most of probably any of the Reserve Banks, so I think it’s not inappropriate to go to different conferences, different meetings, and to essentially meet all the constituents that I have in these different Reserve Banks.  So that’s one reason, certainly. 

[SECTION]

STEVE BECKNER.  Steve Beckner of MNI, Mr. Chairman.  A number of your colleagues, as reflected in the new SEP projections, expect the unemployment rate to get down to 6½ percent next year, which is your threshold for considering raising the funds rate.  And yet the FOMC has also said that it expects to keep rates very accommodative for a considerable time  17 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL after asset purchases and after the recovery has strengthened.  And yet here we are, the middle of 2013, you’ve not even begun to scale back asset purchases.  So, I mean, you’ve partially addressed this.  But, you know, could there be a conflict between, on the one hand, the asset purchase program, on the other hand, the funds rate guidance policy.  Could they conflict?  Could you perhaps elaborate? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I certainly hope the unemployment rate comes down so fast that this becomes a problem.  I guess I would point out a couple of things.  One is that, of course, you know, there’s a range of estimates, and they’re all based on each individual’s idea of optimal policy, so the policy assumptions may not be the same.  So it’s true that some are as low as 6.5, but as I said in my earlier answer, that’s a threshold, not a trigger.  So, evidently, if you, you know, look at the policy expectations that are given in the dot diagram, you’ll see that the very strong majority of FOMC participants still expect rates to be quite low at the end of 2015.  So that’s not inconsistent, that’s just saying that people are looking at a variety of factors, including inflation, which is predicted to be quite low, and other perhaps labor market factors in thinking about when it’ll be appropriate to start increasing rates. 

[SECTION]

SCOTT SPOERRY.  Thank you, Sir.  Scott Spoerry from CNN, CNNMoney.  Well, first of all, I should tell you that your analogy to landing the economy on an aircraft carrier worried me a little bit because, from personal experience, I find that it’s always a little bit jarring to land on an aircraft carrier.  But I wanted to talk about mortgage-backed securities.  You mentioned during your comments here that, if I understood correctly, that you’re not going to dispose of the mortgage-backed securities that you have on the book during this period of normalization.  And I’ve heard many people on Wall Street and elsewhere say that right now the Federal Reserve is the market for mortgage-backed securities, and so—which means that it’s kind of a warped  18 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL and this larger world market, which—what used to be a world market for mortgage-backed securities.  And I guess—I guess what I’m saying, has the ground shifted from under us in terms of the mortgage-backed security world on a permanent basis, or at least for a very long-term basis, because of the devastating nature of what happened a few years ago? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we are still only a fraction of the total holdings of mortgage-backed securities, but, more relevant, as part of our assessment—of our ongoing assessment of the potential costs of our various asset purchase programs, we pay very close attention to market functioning.  And our assessment is that the MBS market is still quite a healthy market in terms of the spreads, in terms of execution times, in terms of the number of people on both sides of the market.  You know, there are REITs now that are building up their MBS portfolios.  There are plenty of real-money investors holding MBS.  So, you know, if the account.  But our assessment—and, of course, we’re in that market quite a bit, so we have a lot of information about it—our assessment is that that market is still working quite well, and that our purchases are not disrupting the normal price discovery and liquidity functions of that There are bills in Congress that would change, reform the GSEs, for example, and ultimately would change the market for mortgage-backed securities, perhaps increasing the amount of private placements or changing the whole institutional structure of that market.  So, we may end up holding some securities, which are in some sense left over from a previous era at some point.  But nevertheless, you know, for the time being, they are the mortgage-backed securities  19 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL own those securities.  And so, we have found it useful to do that, and we believe it’s contributed to lower mortgage rates and a stronger housing market.  So that’s been our rationale.  And just, again, to come back to your question, we do not see any significant deterioration in market functioning.  If there are things that you can point us to, we would be obviously very interested. 

[SECTION]

SCOTT SPOERRY.  Well, let me just follow up with just one thing.  In terms of the government backing through the GSEs of mortgage-backed securities, is there a concern, a legitimate concern that without government backing of this market in some way, that because the private market is—seems to move with much more rapidity than government backing and government purchases, that moving the government out of this backup role on mortgage-backed securities would be a real problem or really change the nature of getting a mortgage in America.  Some people say, you know, if the government wasn’t behind it, it would mean the end of the 30-year mortgage as we know it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, these issues are being debated.  There are some—a number of bills in Congress which would change the GSEs, would eliminate them in some cases, or would place them with backstop government support, as opposed to 100 percent government credit guarantees.  So these are debates that we’re all having about the future of the U.S. mortgage market.  I think it’s entirely possible that if there’s major change in the government’s role in the mortgage market that we might see a different structure in mortgages.  And, you know, other countries have different structures, and they have, in many cases, the same or similar home ownership rates as we do, so it’s possible that we may find that a different structure is better for some people.   

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Greg Robb, MarketWatch.com.  I was wondering if you could go back over your—what you said about the plans for tapering later this  20 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL year.  And why isn’t tapering a tightening?  It seems that many people in the markets just as soon as you talk taper—will taper—are just going to push forward when you—they think that first rate hike will come.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as I tried to explain in my opening remarks, our plans depend on the economic scenario and how it evolves.  And what I tried to do is explain how our asset purchases would evolve if, sort of, the modal, the most likely forecast, were to, in fact, take place, which, of course, it won’t exactly take place, something else will no doubt happen.  But again, our basic forecast is one which is basically, as was pointed out earlier by Mr. Hilsenrath, a moderately optimistic forecast, where growth picks up as we pass through this period of fiscal restraint; where unemployment continues to fall at a gradual pace as it has been since last towards 2 percent.  Those are the conditions that define this sort of baseline forecast.  In that case then, as I described it, we would expect probably to slow or moderate purchases some time later this year, and then through the middle of—through the early part of next year, and ending, in that scenario, somewhere in the middle of the year.  Again though, it’s very important to understand that that’s—if we do that, that would basically say that, you know, that we’ve had a relatively things are worse, we would do more.  If things are better, we will do less.   I think I would—to answer your other question—I would draw the analogy:  If the Federal Reserve in normal times lowers the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, but some traders think that—were expecting 50 basis points, then there might be a sense that the financial conditions have tightened somewhat.  But nevertheless, I think you would say that if the Fed cut the funds rate by 25 basis points, that that was an easing of policy.  And, by the same token, as  21 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL long as we’re buying assets, we are adding to our holdings.  We do believe—although, you know, there’s room for debate—we do believe that the primary effect of our purchases is through the stock that we hold, because that stock has been withdrawn from markets, and the prices of those assets have to adjust to balance supply and demand.  And we’ve taken out some of the supply, and so the prices go up, the yields go down.  So, that, seems to me, consistent with the idea that we’re still adding liquidity, we’re still adding accommodation to the system.

RYAN AVENT.  Ryan Avent, The Economist. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Hi. 

[SECTION]

RYAN AVENT.  Mr. Chairman, I’m trying to sort of understand the view with relation to these inflation figures.  I’m a little surprised at how, I guess, blasé the Committee seems about them, with the exception of President Bullard.  Inflation looks remarkably low on both core and headline, PCE and CPI.  Your projections have it at—rising, the core PCE rising, to at most 2 percent in 2015.  You say that inflation expectations have remained sort of within the range that the Fed has traditionally been comfortable with, but they have fallen by a good ½ percentage point.  And, as you know, that when interest rates are stuck at the zero lower bound, a decline in inflation expectations sort of translates into an increase in real rates.  Why is the Fed not more concerned about this?  It seems to me that earlier in the recovery, they were more concerned about declines in inflation like this.  And wouldn’t you say that, even if you’re happy with the pace of labor market recovery, that, other things equal, this sort of inflation performance suggests that you should be pushing harder on the accelerator. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I don’t disagree with anything you said.  I think low—inflation that’s too low is a problem.  It increases the risk of deflation.  It raises real interest rates.  It means that debt deleveraging takes place more slowly.  Now, there’s always issues about, you  22 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL know, why is it low?  And, as I pointed out, there are a few reasons that are probably not that meaningful economically—for example, the temporary movement in medical prices, the temporary movements in nonmarket prices, things of that sort.  I mean, after all, the CPI is somewhat higher.  And so we expect inflation to come back up, that’s our forecast.  But I don’t want—I think it’s entirely wrong to say we’re not concerned about it.  We are concerned about it.  We would like to get inflation up to our target, and that will be a factor in our thinking about the thresholds.  It will be a factor in our thinking about asset purchases.  And, you know, we’ve got a dual mandate, and it’s maximum employment and price stability.  And there’s a reason why we define price stability as a positive inflation rate, not zero, because we believe that in order to best maximize the mandate, we need to have enough inflation so that there is, in fact, you know, some room for real interest rates to move.  So, I don’t disagree with your basic argument.   

[SECTION]

KEVIN HALL.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman, Kevin Hall with McClatchy Newspapers.  Since you’ve referred to Mr. Hilsenrath, is he the real power behind the throne?  That’s one of the questions we all have.   You had mentioned on several occasions now that quantitative easing is designed to kind of spur economic—drive down the yields, force more risk-taking that flows through the economy.  There had been debate a couple of years ago at the beginning of this about whether it was inflating commodity prices.  Inflation as a whole is subdued, but oil prices are—anchored somewhere around $99—$93 to $99.  We were told once we have domestic production—we have record production now—that that would be a signal to bring prices down.  It hasn’t happened.  Brazil has got people on the streets because of inflation.  To what degree do you think quantitative easing is actually inflating commodity prices, and have you been able to filter that  23 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL out?  And any thoughts on wage growth and why that’s been so flat when everything else seems to be doing good in the economy?

Well, when we—as I recall, I believe I have this right—when we introduced the second round of LSAPs, properly known as QE2, in, I think, November 2010, there was a lot of increase in commodity prices at that time, and there was a lot of complaining that the Fed is pumping up commodity prices, and that that’s a negative for people around the world.  And we argued at the time that the effects of the Federal Reserve’s policy on global commodity prices was probably pretty small, and that it operated—to the extent it did have an effect—it operated through growth—mostly through growth expectations.  That is, a stronger global economy tends to drive up commodity prices.   This time around, we’ve purchased, and are in the process of purchasing, a lot more than we did in so-called QE2.  We haven’t really seen much increase in commodity prices.  Commodity prices are way off their peaks of early last year.  Oil is a little bit different from others in that it’s kind of hung up.  But many other commodity prices have fallen further, and the reason I would give for that is that the emerging markets—China, the rest of Asia, and some other parts of the world—plus Europe, of course, are softer, and so global commodity demand is weaker.  And that explains, I think, the bulk of why commodity prices have not risen so much.  So I think that’s all consistent with our story that the effect of asset purchases on commodity prices—I’m not saying it’s zero, but I don’t think that it’s nearly as big as some folks have suggested. In terms of wages, I think that’s mostly consistent with our view that unemployment, at 7.6 percent, is still pretty far from where we should be satisfied.  Maximum employment, we think, is, again, between 5 and 6 percent, although these are very difficult numbers to estimate.   24 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL So, very weak wage growth, except in a few places and a few narrow occupations, is indicative to me of a labor market that remains quite slack and where, you know, that justifies, I think—together with low inflation—justifies why we are maintaining a highly accommodative policy.

KATE DAVIDSON.  Mr. Chairman, Kate Davidson from Politico.  The SEC’s money Oversight Council endorsed.  Do you think FSOC should defer to the SEC or still press for more to be done? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I’m very glad to see that the SEC has taken up money the expertise and where they have the experience.  In terms of their actual proposal they’ve put out—of course, it’s just a proposal for comment—one of their two proposals, the floating NAV, the floating net asset value, is, of course, qualitatively similar to that—one of the proposals that was in the FSOC suggestions.  We have not yet reviewed this in enough detail to give a view.  But I hope that—I think—I know for sure that by putting out a floating NAV proposal that they’re moving in the right direction.  And I’m hopeful that what comes out will be something that’s sufficient to meet the very important need of stabilizing the money market funds.

AKIO FUJII.  I’m Akio Fujii, Nikkei Newspaper.  Thank you, Chairman.  Recently, we have seen great volatility in Japanese market—equity, JGB, and foreign exchange.  Some say this volatility is due to uncertainty to the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy direction, but others say this is due to lack of confidence to the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy.  So how do you view the Bank of Japan’s efforts?  Do you still support Bank of Japan policy?  And other question is, how much do you pay attention to the spillover effect to the international market when you consider exit strategy?  25 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think the volatility is mostly linked to the Bank of Japan’s efforts, and that would seem logical, since in earlier episodes, when the Fed was doing asset purchases and the BOJ was not doing anything, there was no volatility.  So it sort of seems logical that the change here is the change in BOJ policy.   The BOJ is fighting against a very difficult, entrenched deflation.  And, of course, deflation has been a problem in Japan for many, many years, which means that expectations are very much—the public’s expectations are for continuing deflation, and therefore it takes very aggressive policies to break those expectations and to get inflation up to the 2 percent target that the Bank of Japan has set.   So that’s why it’s difficult, they’ve had to be very aggressive.  That aggressiveness in the early stages of this process, where investors are still learning about the BOJ’s reaction function, it’s not all that surprising that there’s volatility.  Also, the JGB markets are less liquid than, say, the Treasury market, for example.  So I—you know, I think that’s something they need to pay close attention to, but, on the whole, I think that it is important for Japan to attack deflation.  And I also agree with the “three arrows,” the idea that besides breaking deflation, it’s important to address fiscal and structural issues as well.  So, I’m supportive of my colleague, Mr. Kuroda, and I’m supportive of what Japan is doing, even though it does have some effects on our economy as The—there are a lot of reasons why emerging markets and other countries experience capital inflows and volatility.  Some of them have to do with changes in growth expectations.  For example, we’ve seen a lot of changes in growth patterns in the emerging markets recently.  Some of it has to do with risk-on, risk-off behavior, and some of it probably does have to do with monetary policy in advanced economies, which includes, of course, the United States.  We do well.    26 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL take it—pay attention to that.  I frequently meet with colleagues from emerging markets at the G-20, for example, and we discuss these issues.  I think the right way to think about it is that, as the G-7 and the G-20 both have noted, that what U.S. monetary policy, like that of Japan, is trying to do is trying to help this economy grow.  And a global recovery, a global—strong global growth depends very much on the U.S. growing at a reasonable rate.  And so, while there is some effect, I think the net effect, including a stronger U.S. economy, is, on the whole, positive, and I think most of my colleagues in emerging markets recognize that.  That being said, anything we can do through communication or other means to try to minimize any overflow effects or side effects, we will certainly do. know, you’ve talked about being in uncharted territory with policy, and we can remember that these news conferences just began about two years ago as well, and so there’s that mix of communication and policy.  Insofar as the FOMC decided not to include the information about adjusting the asset purchases today, how do you walk that fine line?  And why did the FOMC words?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, we don’t think of this as a change in policy.  What I was deputized to do, if you will, was to try to make somewhat clearer the implications of our existing policy and to try to explain better how the policy would evolve in various economic scenarios, and that’s a little bit difficult to put into, you know, a very terse FOMC statement.  Now that being said, going forward, I think that, you know, some of these elements, to the extent that we can make them useful, will begin to appear in the FOMC statement.  It’s entirely possible.  But it seemed like the right tactic in this case to explain these fairly subtle  27 of 28 June 19, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL contingencies in a context where I could answer questions and respond to any misunderstandings that might occur. Thank you.  28 of 28",Ben Bernanke,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
10,2013-09-18,"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded a two-day meeting earlier today.  As you already know from our statement, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to make no change in either its asset purchase program or its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate target.  I will discuss the rationales for our decision in a moment. Economic growth has generally been proceeding at a moderate pace, with continued—albeit somewhat uneven—improvement in labor market conditions.  Of course, to say that the job market has improved does not imply that current conditions are satisfactory.  Notably, at 7.3 percent, the unemployment rate remains well above acceptable levels.  Long-term unemployment and underemployment remain high.  And we have seen ongoing declines in labor force participation, which likely reflects discouragement on the part of many potential workers as well as longer-term influences, such as the aging of the population.   In the Committee’s assessment, the downside risks to growth have diminished, on net, over the past year, reflecting, among other factors, somewhat better economic and financial conditions in Europe and increased confidence on the part of households and firms in the staying power of the U.S. recovery.  However, the tightening of financial conditions observed in recent months, if sustained, could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and the labor market.  In addition, federal fiscal policy continues to be an important restraint on growth and a source of downside risk. Apart from some fluctuations due primarily to changes in oil prices, inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-term objective.  The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its objective could pose risks to economic September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL performance, and we will continue to monitor inflation developments closely.  However, the unwinding of some transitory factors has led to moderately higher inflation recently, as expected.  And, with longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, the Committee anticipates that inflation will gradually move back toward 2 percent. In conjunction with this meeting, the 17 participants in our policy discussions—5 Board members and 12 Reserve Bank presidents—submitted individual economic projections.  As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.  Also, at this meeting, we extended the horizon of our projections through 2016.   Generally, the projections of individual participants show that they continue to expect moderate economic growth, picking up over time, as well as gradual progress towards levels of unemployment and inflation, consistent with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability.  More specifically, participants’ projections for economic growth have a central tendency of 2.0 to 2.3 percent for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.1 percent in 2014 and 2.5 to 3.3 percent in 2016.  For the unemployment rate, the central tendency of projections for the fourth quarter of each year is 7.1 to 7.3 percent for 2013, normal level for the unemployment rate.  Most participants see inflation gradually increasing from its current low level toward the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent.  The central tendency of their projections for inflation is 1.1 to 1.2 percent for this year, 1.3 to 1.8 percent for 2014, and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016.   With unemployment still elevated and inflation projected to run below the Committee’s longer-run objective, the Committee is continuing its highly accommodative policies.  As you September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL know, in normal times, the Committee eases monetary policy by lowering its target for the short-term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate.  However, the target range for the federal funds rate, currently at 0 to ¼ percent, cannot be lowered meaningfully further.  Accordingly, the Committee has been providing policy support to the economy through two complementary methods:  by purchasing and holding Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and by communicating the Committee’s plans for setting the federal funds rate target over the medium term.  I’ll discuss these tools in turn, beginning with our program of asset purchases. In September 2012, the FOMC initiated a program of purchasing $40 billion per month in agency mortgage-backed securities, in addition to the $45 billion per month in longer-term Treasury securities that we were already acquiring as part of our maturity extension program.  We stated that, subject to our ongoing assessment of the efficacy and costs of the program, purchases would continue until we saw a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor to purchase $45 billion per month in longer-term Treasuries after the maturity extension program ended later that month.  Thus, our total purchases of longer-term securities were maintained at $85 billion per month, in addition to the reinvestment or rolling over of maturing securities on our balance sheet.  The Committee agreed today to continue asset purchases at that rate, subject to the same conditions that we laid out a year ago. Because the Committee tied its asset purchases to the outlook for the labor market, it’s important to assess how that outlook has evolved.  As I noted earlier, conditions in the job progress has been made in the year since we announced the asset purchase program.  For example, the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.1 percent at the time of our announcement to September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 7.3 percent today, and about 2.3 million private-sector jobs have been created over the same period.  Over the past 12 months, aggregate hours of work are up by about 2.4 percent, weekly new claims for unemployment insurance have fallen by about 50,000, and surveys suggest that households perceive jobs as more readily available.  Importantly, these gains were achieved despite substantial fiscal headwinds, which are likely slowing economic growth this year by a percentage point, or more, and reducing employment by hundreds of thousands of jobs.  Not all labor market developments over the past year were positive, however; notably, the labor force participation rate fell by about 0.3 percentage points and real wages remained about flat. In light of this cumulative progress, the FOMC concluded at our June meeting that the criterion of substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market might well be met over the subsequent year or so.  Accordingly, the Committee sought to provide more guidance on how the pace of purchases might be adjusted over time.  The Committee anticipated in June that, subject to certain conditions, it might be appropriate to begin to moderate the pace of purchases later this year, continuing to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, and ending purchases around midyear 2014.  However, we also made clear at that time that adjustments to the pace of purchases would depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook—in particular, on the receipt of evidence supporting the Committee’s expectation that gains in the labor market will be sustained and that inflation is moving back towards its 2 percent objective over time. At the meeting concluded earlier today, the sense of the Committee was that the broad contours of the medium-term economic outlook—including economic growth sufficient to support ongoing gains in the labor market, and inflation moving towards its objective—were close to the views it held in June.  But in evaluating whether a modest reduction in the pace of September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL asset purchases would be appropriate at this meeting, however, the Committee concluded that the economic data do not yet provide sufficient confirmation of its baseline outlook to warrant such a reduction.  Moreover, the Committee has some concern that the rapid tightening of financial conditions in recent months could have the effect of slowing growth, as I noted earlier, a concern that would be exacerbated if conditions tightened further.  Finally, the extent of the effects of restrictive fiscal policies remain unclear, and upcoming fiscal debates may involve additional risks to financial markets and to the broader economy.  In light of these uncertainties, the Committee decided to await more evidence that the recovery’s progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of asset purchases.   The Committee will, of course, continue to monitor economic and financial developments closely.  As noted in today’s statement, in judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor have said, and as today’s decision underscores, asset purchases are not on a preset course.  The Committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the economic outlook and on the Committee’s ongoing assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of the program. Let me turn now to the FOMC’s forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate.  The Committee again reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low range for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, so long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved as described in our statement.  As I have noted frequently, the economic conditions we have set out as preceding any future rate increase are thresholds, not triggers.  For example, a decline in the unemployment rate to September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 6½ percent would not lead automatically to an increase in the federal funds rate target, but would, instead, indicate only that it had become appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook justified such an increase.  The Committee would be unlikely to increase rates if inflation were projected to remain below our 2 percent objective for some time, for example; and, in making its assessment, the Committee would also take into account additional measures of labor market conditions, such as job gains.  Thus, the first increases in short-term rates might not occur until the unemployment rate is considerably below 6½ percent. 2016.   The projections of the path of the federal funds rate by individual Committee participants are generally consistent with this guidance.  Although the central tendency of the projected unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of next year encompasses 6½ percent, 12 of the 17 participants expect the first rate increase to take place in 2015 and two expect it to occur in Most participants also see the funds rate target rising only very slowly after the process of removing policy accommodation begins.  The median projected funds rate for the end of 2015 is 1 percent.  And notably, although the central tendencies of the projections for both inflation and the unemployment rate in 2016 are close to the longer-run normal values for those variables, the median projection for the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 is 2 percent, well below the longer-run normal value for the federal funds rate of 4 percent or so projected by most participants.  Committee participants generally believe that, because the headwinds to recovery will abate only gradually, achieving and maintaining maximum employment and price stability will require a patient policy approach that involves keeping the target for the federal funds rate below its longer-run normal value for some time. September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL Let me close by noting that although the FOMC is employing two instruments of policy—asset purchases and forward guidance about short-term interest rates—the overall stance of monetary policy is what matters for growth, jobs, and inflation.  Our program of asset purchases was set up a year ago to help achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in the context of price stability, relative to conditions when the program was initiated, and we have made progress toward meeting that criterion.  However, even after asset purchases are wound down—which we will do in a manner that is both deliberate and dependent on the incoming economic data—the Federal Reserve’s rates guidance and its ongoing holdings of securities will ensure that monetary policy remains highly accommodative, consistent with an aggressive pursuit of our mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Thank you, and I’d be glad to take your questions. 

[SECTION]

PEDRO DA COSTA.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  Pedro da Costa from Reuters.  You cite meaningful progress on the labor market both on the unemployment front and in terms of payroll growth.  But much of the decline in the unemployment rate has been due, as you know, to the would argue that, while there has been growth, it hasn’t been strong enough to keep up with population growth and make up the gap that we have from the recession.  So, how high do you think the jobless rate would be if it were not for the decline in participation?  I’ve heard estimates as high as 10 to 11 percent.  And could you put the labor market in that context? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Certainly.  So, I think there is a cyclical component to participation, and, in that respect, the unemployment rate understates the amount of sort of true unemployment, if you will, in the economy.  But on the other hand, there is also a downward trend in participation in our economy, which is arising from factors that have been going on for September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL some time, including an aging population, lower participation by prime-age males, fewer women in the labor force—other factors which aren’t really related to this recession.   Over the last year, the unemployment rate has dropped by eight-tenths of a percentage point.  The participation rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point, which is pretty close to the trend.  So, in other words, I think it would be fair to say that most of the improvement in the unemployment rate—not all, but most of it in the last year—is due to job creation rather than lower participation.  I would also note that if you look at the broader measures of unemployment that the BLS publishes, including part-time work, including discouraged workers and so on, you’ll see that those rates have fallen about the same amount as the overall standard civilian unemployment rate.  So I think that there has been progress, and it’s obscured to some extent by the downward trend in participation.  But I also would agree with you that the unemployment rate, while perhaps the best single indicator of the state of labor 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.  To what extent do you regard yourself as responsible for the tightening in financial conditions that you noted?  Was it a mistake to talk about tapering in the way that you did in June and do you stand by your guidance that it will be appropriate?  Do you still expect that it will be appropriate to dial down asset purchases by the end of this year? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So to answer the first part of your question, I think there’s no alternative in making monetary policy but to communicate as clearly as possible, and that’s what we tried to do.  As of June, we had made meaningful progress in labor market conditions, and the Committee thought that was the time to begin talking about how the eventual wind-down of the program would take place and how it would be tied to the evolution of economic variables.  September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL And, in particular, I talked about a proposed strategy that would take about a year for the total wind-down to take place and which, in turn, was also fully contingent on the ratification—so to speak—of our outlook, which included continued improvements in the labor market.  So all of that was very consistent with what we said when we began the program, that our goal was to achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, and we needed to communicate how that was going to be put into practice.  Failing to communicate that information would have risked creating a large divergence between market expectations, public expectations, and what the Committee intentions were, and that could have led to much more serious problems down the road.  So I think the communication was very important.   The general framework—to answer the other part of your question, the general framework in which we’re operating is still the same.  We have a three-part baseline projection, which involves increasing growth that’s picking up over time as fiscal drag is reduced, continuing gains in the labor market, and inflation moving back towards objective.  We are looking to see—in the coming meetings, we’ll be looking to see if the data confirm that basic outlook.  If it does, we’ll take a first step at some point—possibly later this year—and then continue so long as the data are consistent with that continued progress.  And so that basic structure is still in place. But what I want to emphasize is really two things.  First, as I’ve said, asset purchases are not on a preset course, they are conditional on the data.  They’ve always been conditional on the data.  And, secondly, that even as we move from asset purchases to rate policy as the principal tool of monetary policy, it’s our intent to maintain a highly accommodative policy and to provide the support necessary for our economy to recover and to provide jobs for our citizens. September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Just to follow up on Binya’s question, Mr. Chairman, you said that you could pull back the purchases possibly later this year.  You sound a little bit less certain that it’s going to happen later this year.  So I’d like you—to ask you to talk a little bit more about your conviction about whether these are like—the pullback is likely to start this year, where do you stand on that?  And I also don’t think I heard you mentioned that 7 percent unemployment number that you’ve talked—you talked about back in June.  That was the rate that was—the unemployment rate that was supposed to prevail when the Fed was done doing this.  Is that no longer operative? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So there is no fixed calendar—schedule, I really have to emphasize that.  If the data confirm our basic outlook, if we gain more confidence in that outlook and we believe that the three-part test that I mentioned is indeed coming to pass, then we could move later this year, we could begin later this year.  But even if we do that, the subsequent steps will be dependent on continued progress in the economy.  So we are tied to the data—we don’t have a fixed calendar schedule—but we do have the same basic framework that I described in The criterion for ending the asset purchases program is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.  Last time, I gave 7 percent as an indicative number to give you some sense of, you know, where that might be.  But, as my first answer suggested, the unemployment rate is not necessarily a great measure, in all circumstances, of the state of the labor market overall.  For example, just last month, the decline in the unemployment rate came about more than entirely because of declining participation, not because of increased jobs.  So what we will be looking at is the overall labor market situation, including the unemployment September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL rate, but including other factors as well.  But, in particular, there is not any magic number that we are shooting for.  We’re looking for overall improvement in the labor market.

If so, when?  Or did President Obama indicate to you he did not want you to serve a third term?  And those two parts notwithstanding, would you serve a third term if asked, either wholly or in part?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it’s convenient because I have the same answer to all three parts of your question.  If you will indulge me just a little longer, I prefer not to talk about my plans at this point.  I hope to have more information for you at some reasonably soon date, but today I want to focus on monetary policy.  I’d prefer not to talk about my own plans. 

[SECTION]

YLAN MUI.  Ylan Mui, Washington Post.  You mentioned that tighter fiscal conditions are a concern for the Committee as you guys think about whether or not it’s appropriate to reduce asset purchases.  What do you all expect to be able to do in the future, when you actually do begin to pull back in your asset purchases, to manage expectations and manage the market reactions such that we don’t see another increase in rates? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNAKE.  What’s the relationship between the pullback and fiscal policy? 

[SECTION]

YLAN MUI.  Oh, I’m sorry.  I meant financial conditions, tighter financial conditions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Oh, tighter financial conditions, sure.  Well, I think part of the reaction we’ve seen—and it comes from a number of sources—part of it comes from improved economic news and that’s part of the reason why rates have gone up in other countries as well as in the United States.  And that—to the extent that tighter financial conditions reflect a September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL better outlook, that’s a good thing, and that’s not a problem at all.  Part of it reflects views about monetary policy, and that we want to make sure we get straight.  And that’s why—to answer the earlier question, again, it’s why communication is so important.  We need to explain, as best we can, how we’re going to move and on what basis we’re going to move.  It’s much more difficult today than it was 20 years ago because the tools are more complex so they’re less familiar, but that’s still very important.   I think the other factor which was at play was an unwinding of excessively risky and levered positions in the markets, and insufficiencies of liquidity in some cases meant that those unwindings led to larger reactions in prices and rates than might otherwise have occurred.  Now, the tightening associated with that is, to some extent, unwelcome, but, on the other hand, to the extent that some of the riskier, more levered positions have been eliminated, I think that makes the situation more sustainable and reduces, at least, the risk that there will be an over-strong reaction to further announcements.   So we will do our best to communicate clearly.  That is our goal and our objective.  The more clearly we communicate, the better the chance that markets will understand our intentions and that we can avoid any sharp movements.  But, again, we’re dealing with tools that are less familiar, harder to quantify, and harder to communicate about than the traditional funds rate. 

[SECTION]

ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding, from the Financial Times.  Mr. Chairman, the median Committee member expects a 2 percent interest rate at the end of 2016, and, in the long run, they expect interest rates to return to 4 percent.  Can you give us any sense of when you and when the Committee expect interest rates to get back to that 4 percent figure? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me first restate the—I think the key point here, which is that the large majority of the participants of the FOMC, including voting and nonvoting members September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL who are asked to describe their own assessment of optimal policy—the large majority of them estimate that the appropriate target for the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 will be around 2 percent, even though at that time the economy should be close to full employment, according to our best projections.  The reason for that—there may be possibly several reasons, but we did discuss this in the Committee today—the primary reason for that low value is that we expect that a number of factors—including the slow recovery of the housing sector, continued fiscal drag, perhaps continued effects from the financial crisis—may still prove to be headwinds to the recovery.  And even though we can achieve full employment, doing so will be done by using rates lower than, sort of, the long-run normal.  So, in other words, in economics terms, the equilibrium rate, the rate that achieves full employment, looks like it will be lower for a time because of these headwinds that will be slowing aggregate demand growth.   So that’s why we expect to see growth that—I mean, rates at an unusually low level.  I imagine it would take a few more years after that to get to the 4 percent level.  I couldn’t be much more precise than that—I mean, we’re already obviously stretching the bounds of credibility to talk about specific projections to 2016.  But I think you would expect to see that rates would gradually rise for the two or three years after 2016 and ultimately get to 4 percent. 

[SECTION]

JOSH ZUMBRUN.  Mr. Chairman, Josh Zumbrun from Bloomberg News.  You indicated that you can see the Fed lowering the pace of purchases once the economy starts to grow faster, in line with what the Fed’s projected.  For about the past four years, the Fed has been projecting that growth would quicken to about 3 percent, and it never has.  So, at what point are you decide—going to decide that other costs and benefits are the reason that you’re making the decision?  Are we getting close to that having to be a deciding factor even if you don’t get the growth forecast, the way you haven’t the past four years?  And does the complication of this—September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL this is kind of a second question, but I’m going to do it anyway—does the complication of this mean that you need a press conference to make a tapering decision? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, you’re certainly right that we have been over-optimistic about out-year growth.  There are a number of reasons for that.  One reason for it, though, is that it appears—and I talked about this in a speech last year—it appears that, as part of the aftermath of the financial crisis, that, at least temporarily, the potential growth rate of the economy has been slowed, perhaps because new businesses are not being formed at the same rate, innovation may not be translated into new technologies at the same rate, investment is slower, et cetera.  So it appears, again, that the potential rate of growth of the economy has been slowed somewhat, at least temporarily, by the recession and the financial crisis, and you can see that in the slower productivity figures.   Now, we have—you know, we haven’t anticipated that slowdown in productivity, and that’s one of the main reasons why we haven’t anticipated the relatively slow growth.  Now, it’s important to recognize though that what monetary policy affects is not the potential rate of growth, long-run rate of growth, but rather the cyclical part, the deviation of output and employment from its normal level.  And in predicting the amount of slack in the economy, so to speak, we’ve done a little better.  Our predictions of unemployment, for example, have been better than our predictions of growth.  And, in particular, one thing that’s been quite striking is that unemployment—we were too pessimistic on unemployment for this year.  Unemployment has fallen faster than we anticipated.  So, in that respect, we were too pessimistic rather than too optimistic.  So, we’ll continue to do the best we can.  We’re looking, again, to see confirmation of our broader scenario, which basically is that we’ll continue to see progress in the labor market,  September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL that growth will be sufficient to support that progress, and that inflation will be moving back towards target, and that’s what will determine our policy decisions.   In terms of press conferences, I think it’s important to say that there’s an understanding in the Committee that we’ve had for a while, that there are eight “real” meetings every year—that every meeting is a meeting in which any policy decision can be taken.  And, should anything occur at a meeting without a scheduled press conference that requires additional explanation, we certainly could arrange a public, on-the-record conference call or some other way of answering the media’s questions. 

[SECTION]

GREG IP.  Greg Ip of the Economist.  You said that you—the Committee would be unlikely to raise the federal funds rate if inflation remains below target, but your own projections have inflation—that’s the midpoint of your inflation projections—below your 2 percent target through 2016.  So is that inconsistent with the liftoff in the federal funds rate in that period?  And, related, is there a case to be made that your thresholds should be supplemented with a lower bound for the inflation rate—i.e., you won’t tighten if inflation is at or below some lower bound? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So on the latter part, you know, of course, you’re seeing interest rate projections and inflation projections separately.  You’re not seeing them combined by individuals.  Each individual is making their own projection.  I think you’re right, I mean, that we should be very reluctant to raise rates if inflation remains persistently below target, and that’s one of the reasons that I think we can be very patient in raising the federal funds rate since we have not seen any inflation pressure.   On having an inflation floor, that would be in addition to the guidance.  We are discussing how we might clarify the guidance on the federal funds rate.  That is certainly one September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL possibility.  I guess an interesting question there is whether we need additional guidance on that, given that we do have a target.  And, of course, implicit in our policy strategy is trying to reach that target for inflation, but that—an inflation floor is certainly something that, you know, could be a sensible modification or addition to the guidance. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA McGRANE.  Victoria McGrane, Dow Jones Newswires.  Many investors were expecting the Fed to move at least a little bit in pulling back the bond-buying program today.  Given that you all decided not to do that, are—do you have any concerns that, once again, the Fed is confusing investors and sending mixed signals? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I don’t recall stating that we would do any particular thing in this meeting.  What we are going to do is the right thing for the economy.  And our assessment of the data since June is that, taken collectively, that it didn’t quite meet the standard of satisfying our—or of ratifying or confirming our basic outlook for, again, increasing growth, improving labor markets, and inflation moving back towards target.  We try our best to communicate to markets—we’ll continue to do that—but we can’t let market expectations dictate our policy actions.  Our policy actions have to be determined by our best assessment of what’s needed for the economy. 

[SECTION]

PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes, Fox Business, sir.  You mentioned fiscal issues in the statement today.  Are you concerned about a government shutdown?  We’re hearing more about that possibility.  Did that come up in your discussions at this meeting?  What do you think would be the impact of a government shutdown on the economy, and what could the Fed’s—or, would the Fed be prepared to respond to that and help the economy with additional accommodation, for example, additional asset purchases?  Thank you. September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, a factor that did concern us in our discussion was some upcoming fiscal policy decisions.  I would include both the possibility of a government shutdown, but also the debt limit issue.  These are obviously, you know, part of a very complicated set of legislative decisions, strategies, battles, et cetera, which I won’t get into.  But it is the case, I think, that a government shutdown—and perhaps, even more so, a failure to raise the debt limit—could have very serious consequences for the financial markets and for the economy, and the Federal Reserve’s policy is to do whatever we can to keep the economy on course.  And so, if these actions led the economy to slow, then we would have to take that into account, surely.  So this is one of the risks that we are looking at as we think about policy.  That being said, you know, again, our ability to offset these shocks is very limited, particularly a debt limit shock.  And I think it’s extraordinarily important that Congress and the Administration work together to find a way to make sure that the government is funded, public services are provided, that the government pays its bills, and that we avoid any kind of event like 2011, which had, at least for a time, a noticeable adverse effect on confidence and on the economy.

ANNALYN KURTZ.  Annalyn Kurtz, with CNNMoney.  This week marks five years since the financial crisis began, and Hank Paulson, who you’ve worked very closely with, has said his biggest regret was that he wasn’t able to convince the American people that what was done— the bank bailouts—weren’t for Wall Street, they were for Main Street.  What is your biggest regret as you reflect on the five-year anniversary?  And do you believe that the Fed, Congress, and the President have put the necessary measures in place to prevent another deep financial crisis? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, on regrets, as Frank Sinatra says, I have many.  I think my—you know, reasonably, the biggest regret I have is that we didn’t forestall the crisis.  I September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL think once the crisis got going, it was extremely hard to prevent.  You know, I think we did what we could, given the powers that we had, and I would agree with Hank that we were motivated entirely by the interest of the broader public, that our goal was to stabilize the financial system so that it would not bring the economy down, so that it would not create massive unemployment and economic hardship that was even more—that would have been even more severe by many times than what we actually saw.  So I agree with him on that.  And I guess, since you gave me the opportunity, I would mention that, of course, all the money that was used in those operations has been paid back with interest.  And so, it hasn’t been costly, even from a fiscal point of view.   Now, in terms of progress, that’s a good question.  I think we’ve made a lot of progress.  We had, of course, the Dodd–Frank law passed in 2010, and then we recently, you know, have come to agreement internationally on a number of measures, including Basel III and other agreements relating to the shadow banking system and other aspects of the financial system.  I think that our—today, our large financial firms, for example, are better capitalized by far than they were certainly during the crisis and even before the crisis.  Supervision is tougher.  We do stress testing to make sure that firms can withstand not only normal shocks, but very, very large shocks, similar to those they experienced in 2008.  And, very importantly, of course, we now have a tool that we didn’t have in 2008—which would have made, I think, a significant difference if we had had it—which is the orderly liquidation authority that the Dodd–Frank bill gave to the FDIC in collaboration with the Fed.  Under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC, with other agencies, has the ability to wind down a failing financial firm in a way that minimizes the direct impact on the financial markets and on the economy.   Now, I should say, I don’t want to overstate the case—I think there’s a lot more work to be done.  In the case of resolution regimes, for example, the United States has set the course September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL internationally.  Other countries and international bodies like the FSB are setting up standards for resolution regimes, which are very similar to those of the United States, which is going to make for better cooperation across borders.  But we’re still some distance from being fully geared up to work with foreign counterparts to successfully wind down an international—multinational financial firm.  And that’s—we’ve made progress in that direction, but we need to do more, I think.  So, I think there’s more to be done.  There’s more to be done on derivatives, although a lot has been done to make them more transparent and to make the trading of derivatives safer.  But it’s going to be probably some time before, you know, all of this stuff that has been undertaken, all of these measures are fully implemented.  And we can assess, you know, the ultimate impact on the financial system. 

[SECTION]

STEVE BECKNER.  Steve Beckner of MNI, Mr. Chairman.  A number of economists, and, indeed, some of your Fed colleagues, have argued that the effectiveness of quantitative easing has greatly diminished, if not disappeared, and they point to the recent performance of the economy as proof of that.  And there have been a number of people who have argued that there are regulatory and other impediments to growth beyond the reach of monetary policy.  To what extent are these valid arguments?  And if the economy does not speed up, if it does not reach your objectives, how will you ever get out of quantitative easing? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, on the effectiveness of our asset purchases, it’s difficult to get a precise measure.  There’s a large academic literature on this subject, and they have a range of results, some suggesting that this is a quite powerful tool, some that it’s less powerful.  My own assessment is that it has been effective.  If you look at the recovery, you see that some of the strongest sectors, the leading sectors like housing and autos, have been interest-sensitive sectors.  And that these policies have been successful in strengthening financial September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL conditions, lowering interest rates, and thereby promoting recovery.  So I do think that they have been effective.  You mentioned that there hasn’t been any progress.  There has been a lot of progress.  As I said at the beginning, labor market indicators, while still not where we’d like them to be, are much better today than they were when we began this latest program a year ago.  And, importantly—as actually is referenced in our FOMC statement—that happened notwithstanding a set of fiscal policies which the CBO said would cost between 1 and 1½ percentage points of real growth and hundreds of thousands of jobs.  So the fact that we have maintained improvements in the labor market that are as good or better than the previous year, notwithstanding this fiscal drag, is some indication that there is at least a partial offset from monetary policy.   Now, just as you say, there are a lot of things in the economy that monetary policy can’t address.  They include the effectiveness of regulation, they include fiscal policy, they include developments in the private sector.  We do what we can do and what—if we can get help, we’re delighted to have help from other policymakers and from the private sector and we hope that that will happen.  The criterion for ending asset purchases is not, you know, some very high rate of growth.  What it is is the criterion—let me just remind you, the criterion is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, and we have made significant improvement.  Ultimately, we will reach that level of substantial improvement, and at that point, we will be able to wind down the asset purchases.  Again, you know, and I think people don’t fully appreciate that we have two tools:  We have asset purchases, and we have rate policy and guidance about rates.  It’s our view that the latter, the rate policy, is actually the stronger, more reliable tool.  And when we get to the point where we can, you know, where we are close enough to full employment that rate policy will be sufficient, I think that we will still be able to provide—even September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL if asset purchases are reduced—we will still be able to provide a highly accommodative monetary background that will allow the economy to continue to grow and move towards full employment. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Chairman, Donna Borak, with American Banker.  The Financial Stability Oversight Council has already designated two nonbank firms as SIFIs, as you know, and potentially a third very soon, and presumably others to follow.  However, little has been said in terms of how specifically these firms will be regulated by the Fed, which has been a chief criticism of the entire process.  Given that, can you provide us any guidance at this point in terms of how far along the Fed is in terms of letting the banks know how they will be regulated besides, you know, tailoring the plans? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the two firms that have been designated, AIG and GE Capital, actually are—have been regulated by the Fed, because both of them are savings and loan, thrift holding companies.  So we have a lot of already experience with those firms and a lot of contact with those firms.  We will—I want to use the word “tailored” because we want to design a regime that is appropriate for the business model of the particular firm.  But our other objective, and what makes designation by the FSOC particularly noteworthy, is that the primary goal of the consolidated supervision by the Fed is to make sure that the firms—the firm doesn’t in any way endanger the stability of the broad financial system.  So we’ll be looking at not just the usual safety and soundness type matters or supervision, which both can be, again, tailored to the types of assets and liabilities that the firm has, but also we’re going to want to focus on things like resolution authority, practices relating to derivatives and other exposures, interconnectedness, et cetera, to make sure that the firm in its structure and in its operations doesn’t pose a threat to the wider system.  And that’s what is going to be distinctive about our September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL oversight, not only of these designated firms, but also of the large bank holding companies that we already oversee and which we are already subjecting to tougher supervision, higher capital, stress tests, and all the rest. 

[SECTION]

PETER COOK.  Peter Cook of Bloomberg Television, Mr. Chairman.  One of my colleagues was remarking as we came in here, we don’t often get surprises from the Federal Reserve.  This was a surprise, you talked about—you hadn’t telegraphed anything specifically, but you’ve seen the market reaction, I’m sure.  My question for you is, were you intending a surprise today, and did you get the intended result, judging from the market reaction?  And related to that, by taking this action today—continuing the bond purchases going forward—at what point do you believe you’re starting to complicate the exit strategy?  Simply by continuing to keep the Fed’s foot on the gas pedal, do you make life more complicated for the Federal Reserve down the road? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it’s our intention to try to set policy as appropriate for the economy, as I said earlier.  We are somewhat concerned.  I won’t overstate it, but we do want to see the effects of higher interest rates on the economy, particularly in mortgage rates, on housing.  So to the extent that our policy makes conditions—our policy decision today makes conditions just a little bit easier, that’s desirable.  We want to make sure that the economy has adequate support and, in particular, it’s less surprising the market or easing policy as it is avoiding a tightening until we can be comfortable that the economy is in fact growing, you know, the way we want it to be growing.  So this was a step—it was a step, a precautionary step if you will.  It was a—the intention is to wait a bit longer and to try to get confirming evidence whether to the—to whether or not the economy is, in fact, conforming to this general outlook that we have.  I don’t think that we are complicating anything for future FOMCs.  It’s true that September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL the assets that we’ve been buying add to the size of our balance sheet.  But we have developed a variety of tools, and we think we have numerous tools that we—can be used to both manage interest rates and to ultimately unwind the balance sheet when the time comes.  So I, you know, I’m—I feel quite comfortable that we can—in particular, that we can raise interest rates at the appropriate time, even if the balance sheet remains large for an extended period.  And that will be true, of course, for, you know, future FOMCs as well. 

[SECTION]

KATE DAVIDSON.  Mr. Chairman, Kate Davidson from Politico.  Do you think that all of the recent attention being paid to who will be your replacement has had any immediate effect on the Fed, and could it have any lingering effect on your successor?  And also, do you think the process has just become too politicized, or is this part of a healthy debate? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think the Federal Reserve has strong institutional credibility.  And it is a strong institution, a highly competent institution, and it’s independent, it’s nonpartisan, and I’m not particularly concerned about the political environment for the Federal Reserve.  I think the Fed will be—continue to be an important institution in the United States, and that it will maintain its independence going forward. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Greg Robb, MarketWatch.  Was there a discussion among the Committee today about changing the forward guidance, the 6.5 percent jobless rate?  And could you say why the Committee decided to hold that steady in light of the weaker economy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as I mentioned earlier, the Committee has regularly reviewed the forward guidance, and there are a number of ways in which the forward guidance could be strengthened.  For example, Mr. Ip mentioned an inflation floor.  There are other steps that we could take.  We could provide more information about what happens after we get to September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 6.5 percent and those sorts of things, and to the extent that we could provide precise guidance, I think that would be desirable.  Now, it’s very important that we not take any of these steps lightly, that we make sure we understand all the implications, and that we are comfortable that it will be—that any modifications of the guidance will be credible to markets and to the public.  So, we continue to think about options.  There are a number of options that we have talked about.  But today, we—as of today, we didn’t choose to make any changes to the guidance. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Don Lee, L.A. Times.  As you may know, the Census Bureau reported yesterday that the poverty rate and the median household income saw no improvement last year.  And I wonder, when you see median incomes turning up significantly for most people, and in light of the fact that people in the middle and the bottom have seen very little of the gains relative to higher income households, how would you assess the—both quantitative easing and Fed policies? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.  So that’s certainly the case that there are too many people in poverty.  There are a lot of complex issues involved.  There are complex measurement issues, I would just have to mention that.  There are a lot of issues that are really long-term issues as well.  For example, it might seem a puzzle that the U.S. economy gets richer and richer, and yet there are more poor people.   And the explanation, of course, is that our economy is becoming more unequal.  The more very rich people and more people in the lower half who are not doing well, these are—there’s a lot of reasons behind this trend, which has been going on for decades, and economists disagree about the relative importance of things like technology and international trade and unionization and other factors that have contributed to that.  But I guess my first point is that these long-run trends—it’s important to address these trends, but the Federal Reserve doesn’t September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL really have the tools to address these long-run distributional trends.  They can only be addressed really by Congress and by the Administration.  And it’s up to them, I think, to take those steps.  The Federal Reserve is—we are doing our part to help the median family, the median American, because one of our principal goals—we have two principal goals, one is maximum employment, jobs.  The best way to help families is to create employment opportunities.  We’re still not satisfied, obviously, with where the labor market, the job market is.  We’ll continue to try to provide support for that.  And then the other goal is price stability, low inflation, which, of course, also helps make the economy work better for people in the middle and the lower parts of the distribution.   So we use the tools that we have.  It would be better to have a mix of tools at work—not just monetary policy, but fiscal policy and other policies as well.  But the Federal Reserve, we can—you know, we only have a certain set of tools, and those are the ones that we use.  Again, our objective—our objectives of creating jobs and maintaining price stability, I think, are quite consistent with helping the average American, but there’s limits to what we can do about long-run trends, and I think those are very important issues that Congress and the Administration, you know, need to look at and decide, you know, what needs to be done there.

JEREMY TORDJMAN.  Hi, Jeremy Tordjman, with AFP.  Some emerging countries are blaming the Fed policies for the financial distress that they are experiencing.  I wanted to have your take on that.  And also, how did you judge the way the markets reacted to your tapering announcement back in June?  Thank you very much. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, let me just talk about—I talked a little bit about the communication in June.  Let me talk just about the emerging markets, which I think is an important issue.  Let me just first say that we have a lot of economists who spend all of their time September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL looking at international aspects of monetary policy, and we spend a lot of time looking at emerging markets.  I spend a lot of time talking to my colleagues in emerging markets.  So we’re watching that very carefully.  The United States is part of a globally integrated economic and financial system, and problems in emerging markets—or in any country, for that matter—can affect the United States as well.  And so, again, we are watching those developments very carefully.   It is true that changes in longer-term interest rates in the United States—but also in other advanced economies—does have some effect on emerging markets, particularly those who are trying to peg their exchange rate, and can lead to some capital inflows or outflows.  But there are also other factors that affect inflows and outflows.  Those include changes in risk preference by investors, changes in growth expectations, different perceptions of institutional strength within emerging markets across different countries.  So there are a lot of factors that are there playing a role, and that’s one reason why different emerging markets have had different experiences.  They have different institutional structures and different policies.  But, just to come to the bottom line here, we think it’s very important that emerging markets grow and are prosperous.  We pay close attention to what’s happening in those countries—it affects the United States.   The main point, I guess, I would end with, though, is that what we’re trying to do with our monetary policy here is, I think, my colleagues in the emerging markets recognize, is trying to create a stronger U.S. economy.  And a stronger U.S. economy is one of the most important things that could happen to help the economies of emerging markets.  And, again, I think my colleagues in many of the emerging markets appreciate that—notwithstanding some of the effects that they may have felt—that efforts to strengthen the U.S. economy and other advanced economies in Europe and elsewhere ultimately redounds to the benefit of the global economy, September 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL including emerging markets as well. Thank you. ",Ben Bernanke,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
11,2013-12-18,"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded a two-day meeting earlier today.  As you already know from our statement, the Committee decided, starting next month, to modestly reduce the pace at which it is increasing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  The Committee also clarified its guidance on interest rates, emphasizing that the current near-zero range for the federal funds rate target likely will remain appropriate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.   Today’s policy actions reflect the Committee’s assessment that the economy is continuing to make progress, but that it also has much farther to travel before conditions can be judged normal.  Notably, despite significant fiscal headwinds, the economy has been expanding at a moderate pace, and we expect that growth will pick up somewhat in coming quarters, helped by highly accommodative monetary policy and waning fiscal drag.  The job market has continued to improve, with the unemployment rate having declined further.  At the same time, the recovery clearly remains far from complete, with unemployment still elevated and with both underemployment and long-term unemployment still major concerns.  We have also seen ongoing declines in labor force participation, which likely reflect not only longer-term influences, such as the aging of the population, but also discouragement on the part of potential workers. Inflation has been running below the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent.  The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its objective could pose risks to economic December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL performance and is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over time.  This outlook is broadly consistent with individual economic projections submitted in conjunction with this meeting by the 17 FOMC participants—5 Board members and 12 Reserve Bank presidents.  As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.  FOMC participants generally expect economic growth to pick up somewhat over the next few years.  Their projections for increases in gross domestic product have a central tendency of 2.2 to 2.3 percent for 2013, rising to between 2.8 and 3.2 percent for next year, with similar growth estimates for 2015 and 2016.  Participants see the unemployment rate, which was 7 percent in November, as continuing to decline.  The central tendency of the projections has the unemployment rate falling to between 6.3 and 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 and then to between 5.3 and 5.8 percent by the final quarter of 2016.  Meanwhile, FOMC participants continue to see inflation running below our 2 percent objective for a time but moving gradually back toward 2 percent as the economy expands.  The central tendency of their inflation projections for 2013 is 0.9 to 1.0 percent, rising to 1.4 to 1.6 percent for next year and to between 1.7 and 2.0 percent in 2016.   Let me now return to our decision to reduce the pace of asset purchases.  When we began the asset purchase program in September 2012, we said that we would continue purchases until the outlook for the labor market had improved substantially in a context of price stability.  Since then, we have seen meaningful cumulative progress in the labor market.  For example, since we began the current purchase program, the economy has added about 2.9 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen by more than a percentage point, to 7 percent.  For comparison, when we started the program, many forecasters saw the unemployment rate remaining near December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 8 percent throughout 2014.  Recent economic indicators have increased our confidence that the job market gains will continue.  For example, nonfarm payrolls have recently been increasing at a pace of about 200,000 jobs per month, and the unemployment rate has fallen by 0.6 percentage point since June.  With fiscal restraint likely diminishing and with signs that household spending is picking up, we expect economic growth to be strong enough to support further job gains.  Further, FOMC participants now see the risks around their forecasts of growth and unemployment as having become more nearly balanced, rather than tilted in an unfavorable direction as they were at the inception of the asset purchase program.   As you know, we have been purchasing $85 billion per month in longer-term Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities.  Starting in January, we will be purchasing $75 billion of securities a month, reducing purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities by $5 billion each.  It is important to note though that, even after this reduction, we will be still expanding our holdings of longer-term securities at a rapid pace.  We will also continue to roll over maturing Treasury securities and reinvest principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities into agency mortgage-backed securities.  Our sizable and still-increasing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and make financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote further progress in the labor market and help move inflation back toward the Committee’s objective of 2 percent.   Our modest reduction in the pace of asset purchases reflects the Committee’s belief that progress toward its economic objectives will be sustained.  If the incoming data broadly support the Committee’s outlook for employment and inflation, we will likely reduce the pace of securities purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.  Of course, continued progress December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL is by no means certain.  Consequently, future adjustments to the pace of asset purchases will be deliberate and dependent on incoming information.  Asset purchases remain a useful tool that we are prepared to deploy as needed to meet our objectives. With unemployment still well above its longer-run normal rate, which Committee participants currently estimate to be between 5.2 and 5.8 percent, and with inflation continuing to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-term objective, highly accommodative monetary policy remains appropriate.  To emphasize its commitment to provide a high level of monetary accommodation for as long as needed, the FOMC today also enhanced its forward guidance.  For the past year, the Committee has said that the current low target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6½ percent, inflation was projected to be no more than half a percentage point above our 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored.  We have emphasized that these numbers are thresholds, not triggers, meaning that crossing a threshold would not lead automatically to an increase in the federal funds rate but would indicate only that it was appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook justified such an increase.  With many FOMC participants now projecting that the 6½ percent unemployment threshold will be reached by the end of 2014, the Committee decided to provide additional information about how it expects its policies to evolve after the threshold is crossed.  Based on its assessment of current conditions and the outlook, which is informed by a range of indicators, including measures of labor market conditions, financial conditions, and inflation pressures, the Committee now anticipates it will likely be appropriate to maintain the current federal funds rate target well past the time that the unemployment rate declines to below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below its 2 percent goal.  In part, December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL this expectation reflects our assessment, based on a comprehensive set of indicators, that there will still be a substantial amount of slack in the labor market when the unemployment rate falls to 6½ percent.  This continuing job market slack imposes heavy costs on the unemployed and the underemployed and their families and reduces our nation’s productive capacity, warranting our ongoing highly accommodative policy.  But, as the last phrase of the enhanced guidance underscores, the prospects for inflation provide another reason to keep policy accommodative.  The Committee is determined to avoid inflation that is too low as well as inflation that is too high, and it anticipates keeping rates low at least until it sees inflation clearly moving back toward its 2 percent objective. Our forward guidance is reflected in Committee participants’ latest projections for the path of the federal funds rate.  Although the central tendency of the projected unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of next year encompasses 6½ percent, 15 of 17 FOMC participants do not expect a rate increase before 2015.  Most see our target for the federal funds rate as rising only modestly in 2015, while 3 do not see an increase until 2016.  For all participants, the median projection for the federal funds rate is 75 basis points at the end of 2015 and 1.75 percent at the end of 2016. In summary, reflecting cumulative progress and an improved outlook for the job market, the Committee decided today to modestly reduce the monthly pace at which it is adding to the longer-term securities on its balance sheet.  If incoming information supports the Committee’s expectation of further progress toward its objectives, the Committee is likely to reduce the pace of monthly purchases in further measured steps in future meetings.  However, the process will be deliberate and data-dependent; asset purchases are not on a preset course.  The FOMC also provided additional guidance on future short-term interest rates, stating that it expects to December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL maintain the federal funds target in its current near-zero range well past the time that the unemployment rate falls below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below 2 percent.  The Federal Reserve’s enhanced guidance about its policy intentions and its substantial and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities will ensure that monetary policy remains highly accommodative, consistent with the pursuit of its mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Thank you.  I’ll be glad to take your questions. 

[SECTION]

YLAN MUI.  Thank you.  Ylan Mui with the Washington Post.  Today was the first reduction in asset purchases, and you just said that future reductions will likely occur in measured steps, but are not on a predetermined course.  Can you tell us any more about the framework that you all plan to use to determine the size and the timing of those reductions?  And previously you had said that you expect the program to end altogether by the middle of next year.  Is that still a likely scenario? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as I said, the steps that we take will be data-dependent.  If we’re making progress in terms of inflation and continued job gains—and I imagine we’ll continue to do, probably at each meeting, a measured reduction—that would take us to late in the year, certainly not by the middle of the year.  If the economy slows for some reason or we are disappointed in the outcomes, we could skip a meeting or two.  On the other side, if things really pick up, then of course we could go a bit faster, but my expectation is for similar moderate steps going forward throughout most of 2014. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, thank you.  When you say “similar moderate steps going forward,” is $10 billion an increment that people should anticipate?  And is equal amounts of mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries also what one December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL should anticipate?  Finally, when you say “well past” the unemployment rate of 6½ percent, why not pick a number?  Why say “well past”?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.  On the first issue of $10 billion, again, we say we are going to take further modest steps subsequently, so that would be the general range.  But again, I want to emphasize that we are going to be data-dependent.  We could stop purchases if the economy disappoints.  We could pick them up somewhat if the economy is stronger.1   In terms of MBS versus Treasuries, we discussed that issue.  I think that the general sense of the Committee was that equal reductions, or approximately equal reductions, was the simpler way to do this.  It obviously doesn’t make a great deal of difference in the end to how much we hold.  So that was going to be our strategy. On the issue of another number, the unemployment rate—let’s talk first about the labor the best single indicator that we have.  And so we were comfortable setting a 6.5 percent unemployment rate as the point at which we would begin to look at a more broad set of labor rate, we want to—once we get to 6½—we want to look at hiring, quits, vacancies, participation, long-term unemployment, et cetera, wages.  We couldn’t put it in terms of another unemployment rate level, specifically.  So, I expect there will be some time past the 6½ percent before all of the other variables that we’ll be looking at will line up in a way that will give us confidence that the labor market is strong enough to withstand the beginning of increases in rates.                                                              1 The Chairman meant to say:  “We could stop the reductions in the pace of purchases if the economy disappoints.  We could reduce the pace of purchases somewhat more quickly if the economy is stronger.” December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL The SEP, the Survey of Economic Projections, which were distributed, obviously that’s individual assessments and not the Committee’s collective view.  But nevertheless, it gives you some sense of current expectations about the length of time.  The SEP shows that the 6.5 percent is expected by a large number of people to be reached about at the end of next year, end of 2014.  And then the first rate increases, according to the so-called dots chart, take place near the end of 2015.  So that’s the order of the magnitude, I think, that people are currently expecting, but again I emphasize that it will depend on our being persuaded that—over, across a broad range of indicators—the labor market is sufficiently strong that we could begin to withdraw accommodation.

JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Mr. Chairman, as you well know, the Fed is going through a transition next month.  Can you talk about the role that Janet Yellen played in formulating the policy that’s being laid out today, and what kind of consistency the public can expect as we go into her tenure, assuming she’s confirmed, with the program that you’re laying out today?  Will it carry on under her leadership? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, it will.  I have always consulted closely with Janet, even well before she was named by the President, and I consulted closely with her on these 

[SECTION]

ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times.  Mr. Chairman, your inflation forecasts never get back to 2 percent in the time horizon that you cover here, out to 2016.  Given that, why should we believe the Fed has a symmetric inflation target?  And, in particular, why should we believe you’re following an optimal policy—optimal control policy, as you’ve said in the past—given that that would imply inflation going a bit above target at some point?  Thank you. December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, these are individual estimates, there are big standard errors implicitly around them and so on.  We do think that inflation will gradually move back to 2 percent, and we allow for the possibility, as you know, in our guidance that it could go as high as 2½ percent.  Even though inflation has been quite low in 2013, let me give you the case for why inflation might rise.   First, there are some special factors, such as health-care costs and some other things, that have been unusually low and might be reversed.  Secondly, if you look at the fundamentals for inflation, including inflation expectations, whether measured by financial markets or surveys; if you look at growth, which we now anticipate will be picking up both in the U.S. and internationally; if you look at wages, which have been growing at 2 percent and a little bit higher according to many indicators—all of these things suggest that inflation will gradually pick up.  But what I tried to emphasize in my opening remarks, and which is clear in our statement, is that we take this very seriously.  It’s not easy to—inflation cannot be picked up and moved where you want it.  It takes—it requires, obviously, some luck and some good policy.  But we are very committed to making sure that inflation does not stay too low, and we are continuing to monitor that very carefully and to take whatever actions necessary to achieve that. 

[SECTION]

ROBIN HARDING.  And on optimal control? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, even under optimal control, it would take a while for inflation—inflation is quite—can be quite inertial.  It can take quite a time to move.  And the responsiveness of inflation to increasing economic activity is quite low.  So—and particularly given an environment where we have falling oil prices and other factors that are contributing downward forces on inflation, it’s difficult to get inflation to move quickly to target.  But we are, December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL again, committed to doing what’s necessary to get inflation back to target over the next couple of years. 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.  There’s been a great deal of discussion in your profession about the potency of policy at the zero boundary.  And to kind of bounce off Robin, it’s very striking that inflation has fallen while QE3 has been in place, and the economy continues to undershoot the FOMC’s forecast.  So, I guess the simple question is, are you giving up?  You know, I mean, have you reached the limit of your policy tools, and is there nothing more you can do?  The economy is still running way below the trend line that existed before the financial crisis. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, everything depends on what benchmark you compare it to, as you know.  I said last year that monetary policy was not a panacea.  It couldn’t solve all our problems.  And, in particular, it can’t do anything about a slowing in potential growth, which appears to have happened, at least to some extent.  It can’t do much or anything about fiscal policy, which is working in quite the opposite direction.  So, given those things, I think the outcomes we’ve had are perhaps not as bad as you would—might think.  In particular, as I’ve mentioned many times, the Congressional Budget Office assessed the fiscal drag in 2013 as being about 1½ percentage points of growth.  We’re looking like we’re going to get in the low 2s actual growth.  Add those numbers together, it’s kind of a counterfactual.  It says that monetary policy appears to have succeeded in offsetting a good bit of that fiscal drag, which we were not at all sure that we could accomplish.  So, we’re certainly not giving up.  We intend to maintain a highly accommodative policy.  Nothing that we did today was intended to reduce accommodation.  We’re still going to be buying assets at a high rate and increasing and holding—increasing our balance sheet and holding on to those assets.  In our guidance today—December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL we strengthened our guidance to make clear that we expect to keep rates low well beyond the point that unemployment hits 6½ percent. 

[SECTION]

PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes, Fox Business, sir.  Was it a close call in the discussion today among participants and members of—given all you’ve said about the outlook and your forecast, was there a lot a of debate on whether or not to go ahead and start tapering now or wait longer—wait for more data? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, certainly, it’s a very—it was a very important was, did we feel comfortable that—to say that we had met, or were at least well on the way towards meeting, the criterion we set when we began the program in September of 2012?  And that criterion, of course, was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.  And if you look at the cumulative improvement—and I mentioned some figures in my opening remarks—or if you look at recent numbers, either on employment, unemployment.  And also in terms of growth, we’re seeing encouraging numbers in terms of household spending, for example, auto purchases, fiscal drag is reduced, stronger numbers internationally.  Now, I don’t want to overstate the case.  As you look at our projections, you’ll see we only assume or project a small pickup in growth going into next year.  But there was a pretty widespread view that there was a reasonable expectation, first, that the recent gains in the labor market would continue—and, remember, we’re just beginning this process now, so by the time we complete this process, I think it’s very likely that we’ll easily pass the hurdle of a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.  Now, it is true that while we have passed the—or, made significant progress on the labor market and growth hurdles, there is still this question about inflation, which is a bit of a concern—more than a bit of concern, as we indicated in our statement.  Our outlook December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL is still for inflation to go back to 2 percent.  I gave you some reasons why I think that will happen.  But we take that very seriously, and if inflation does not show signs of returning to target, we will take appropriate action. 

[SECTION]

REBECCA JARVIS.  Hi, there.  Rebecca Jarvis, ABC News.  Mr. Chairman, now that you have introduced tapering into the system, if the economy were to stumble again in the future, would you recommend, or have you discussed with your colleagues, increasing bond buying in the future?  And have you considered any alternative measures—for example, more direct stimulus directly into the economy if it were to stumble again? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  What kind of direct stimulus do you have in mind? 

[SECTION]

REBECCA JARVIS.  Well, any type of stimulus that you would not be essentially buying it back from the banks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, in terms of the legal authorities that the Federal Reserve has, we don’t have some of the— 

[SECTION]

REBECCA JARVIS.  If you could ask for it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If we could ask for it.  Well, we’re getting now to a fanciful discussion, I think.  I think our basic tools are asset purchases, and we are allowed only to buy Treasuries and agency securities.  We are not allowed to buy corporates or other things, the way many central banks are.  We have—with interest rates near zero, we can manage our forward guidance, and I think that has been helpful, that’s been effective.  We probably could do more with that.  But there are limits to that as well because, beyond a certain point, markets may not accept—you know, may not view the long-distance, way-ahead guidance as being credible.  We can change the interest rate we pay on reserves, which is something we’ve talked about.   December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL The other kind of thing that—the only other thing I can think of that amounts to a direct infusion into the economy, if you will, is action similar to the British Funding for Lending program, where they provided cheap funding to banks if the banks could show that they had increased their lending to households or small businesses.  We could, in principle, do something like that, and we’ve looked at that because we do have a discount window where we lend to banks.  However, somewhat differently from what was going on in the U.K. and in Europe, here, our banks are flush with liquidity, they have plenty of cash on hand—they own lots of reserves, of course.  And so our sense was that there just wouldn’t be any take up on that program, at least under current conditions.  We do not have the authority to lend directly to small businesses or other types of institutions.  And in any case, I don’t think right now that tight credit, in most areas, is the major problem.  I think what we have, in many cases, is that firms are either not looking for credit or their balance sheets are not strong enough that they pass creditworthy screenings at the bank.  So we do have a range of things that we can do, but we are already being, I think, pretty aggressive. 

[SECTION]

REBECCA JARVIS.  And would you increase the bond purchases? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Under some circumstances, yes. 

[SECTION]

GREG IP.  Greg Ip of the Economist.  I have a narrow question and a related broader question.  The narrow question is, did the changeover in leadership play any role in the decision on when to begin tapering, i.e., at this meeting?  For example, did you have a preference, all else equal, to get it started before you left?  The related broader question is, you are a historian of monetary policy.  What do you think future historians of monetary policy will have to say about your eight years at the Federal Reserve helm? December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The answer to the first question is “no.”  The answer to the second question is “I’ll be interested to see.”  I hope I live long enough to read the textbooks.  The—what we’ve showed—there’ve been two big changes, at least—more than two, but two that I would cite at the Fed in the last few years, of course, the result, in many ways, of the crisis.  The first is that the Federal Reserve has rediscovered its roots, in the sense that the Fed was created to stabilize the financial system in times of panic.  And we did that, and we used tools that were analogous in spirit to what central banks have done for many hundreds of years, but, of course, adapted to a modern financial system. The other thing that was unique about—maybe not completely unique, but largely unique about this period was that we were trying to help the economy recover from a deep recession at a time when interest rates were almost, or essentially, zero.  And that required us to use other methods—most prominently, forward guidance and asset purchases, neither of which is entirely new.  But, clearly, this is—unless you put aside the Depression, where monetary policy was, on the whole, pretty passive—this is the first—one of the first examples, at least, of aggressive monetary policy taking place in a near-zero interest rate environment.  Now we’re seeing, of course, Japan and the U.K. and other countries also taking similar types of approaches.  And I think that will be an issue—an area that monetary historians will be interested in exploring, as well as monetary theorists and empirical studies. 

[SECTION]

JASON LANGE.  Jason Lange with Reuters.  Chairman Bernanke, today, with one hand, you’re giving the economy something by telling us that or signaling that you may keep interest rates lower for longer than we previously thought.  But with the other hand, you’re taking something away by reducing the large-scale asset purchases.  If you think that, overall, this is maintaining the level of monetary accommodation steady, is that a sign that the decision to December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL reduce the asset purchases is relatively less about an improved outlook for the economy and perhaps more about the concern that the asset purchases are less effective or might be fueling bubbles?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as I said before, asset purchases are a supplementary tool.  Our main tool is interest rate policy.  The reason that asset purchases are a supplementary tool is because it’s a much less familiar tool.  We have less ability to calibrate how big the effects are, for example.  And it’s also true that, as the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve gets large, managing that balance sheet, exiting from that balance sheet become more difficult.  And there are concerns about effects on asset prices, although, I would have to say that’s another thing that future monetary economists will want to be looking at very carefully.  So, our view was—in for a good long time.  The economy, though, was faltering.  We needed an additional boost.  And so we brought in the asset purchase program again.  We put in a specific objective, which is substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.  Our sense was once that intermediate objective was attained—that is, when the economy had grown and was moving forward—that, at that point, we could begin to wind down the secondary tool, the supplementary tool, and achieve essentially the same amount of accommodation using interest rates and forward guidance.   And so, I do want to reiterate that this is not intended to be a tightening.  We don’t think that there’s an inflation problem or anything like that.  On the one hand, asset purchases are still going to be continuing, we’re still going to be building our balance sheet.  The total amount of assets that we acquire are probably more than was—certainly more than what was expected in December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL continue to hold.  And now we’ve also clarified our guidance that we will be keeping rates low well past unemployment of 6.5 percent.  So we’re trying here to get a high level of accommodation.  It is true that the purchases are—we view as supplementary to the interest rate policy.  But, again, the action today is intended to keep the level of accommodation more or less the same overall and enough to push the economy forward. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA MCGRANE.  Victoria McGrane, Dow Jones.  In an earlier response, you sort of laid out the argument against—or sort of explained why the Committee didn’t lower the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold.  Is that conversation over?  Have you all put off the table changing those thresholds?  Has there been any other further discussion on perhaps adding a lower bound to the inflation target as well?  And then, specifically on inflation, what tools or actions could the Committee take if inflation continues to run below your target or even falls further? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think we want to make an assessment now.  I wouldn’t expect any changes in the very near term.  We want to see how much accommodation we have and whether it’s sufficient, whether the economy is continuing to grow, and inflation is moving back toward target, as we anticipate.  But there are things we can do.  We can strengthen the guidance in various ways.  And while the view of the Committee was that the best way forward today was in this more qualitative approach, which incorporates elements both of the unemployment threshold and the inflation floor, that further strengthening would be possible, and it’s something that has certainly not been ruled out.  And, of course, asset purchases are still there to be used.  We do have tools to manage a large balance sheet.  We’ve made a lot of progress on that.  So while, again, while we think that we can provide a high level of accommodation with a somewhat slower pace—but still very high pace—of asset purchases and December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL our interest rate policy, we do have other things we can do if we need to ramp up again.  That being said, we’re hopeful that the economy will continue to make progress, and that we’ll begin to see the whites of the eyes of the end of the recovery and the beginning of the more normal period of economic growth. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Some members of your staff published a paper earlier this fall arguing that in times of high unemployment—and, particularly, when some of that unemployment is calcifying into disengagement—there’s an argument for monetary policy to be even more aggressive.  And yet you are now announcing that you’ll do less rather than more.  The Fed has done that twice before and both times has regretted the decision.  Can you talk about why you are not erring on the side of doing more? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, we’re not doing less.  We’ll see how accommodation shapes up.  But while we are slowing asset purchases a bit, again, we expect the total balance sheet to be quite large and maintained for—at a large level for a long time.  And we expect to keep rates low for a very long time.  We’re providing a great deal of accommodation to the economy.  I agree with your observation, and the observation of the paper that you cited, that there is a case for being particularly aggressive, and I think we have been aggressive to try to keep the economy growing, and we are seeing progress in the labor market.  So I would dispute the idea that we’re not providing a lot of accommodation to the economy. 

[SECTION]

WYATT ANDREWS.  Mr. Chairman, thank you. Wyatt Andrews at CBS.  Given the billions of dollars that the Fed has put into the economy over the years, do you see a leading reason why the economy has not created more jobs? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So, we’ve been in a—it’s been about a little over four years now since the recovery began, four and a half years.  It’s been a slow recovery.  There are a December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL number of reasons for that.  It’s—of course, that’s something for econometricians and historians to grapple with, but there have been a number of factors which have contributed to slower growth.  They include, for example, the observation that financial crises tend to disrupt the economy, may affect innovation, new products, new firms.  We had a big housing bust, and so, the construction sector, of course, has been quite depressed for a while.  We’ve had continuing financial disturbances in Europe and elsewhere.  We’ve had very tight, on the whole—except for in 2009—we had very tight fiscal policy.  People don’t appreciate how tight fiscal policy has been.  At this stage in the last recession, which was a much milder recession, state, local, and federal governments had hired 400,000 additional workers from the trough of the recession.  At the same point in this recovery, the change in state, local, and federal government workers is minus 600,000.  So there’s about a million workers difference in how many people are—have been employed at all levels of government.  So, fiscal policy has been tight, contractionary, so there have been a lot of headwinds.  All that being said, we have been disappointed in the pace of growth, and we don’t fully understand why.  Some of it may just be a slower pace of underlying potential, at least temporarily.  Productivity has been disappointing.  It may be that there’s been some bad luck—for example, the effects of the European crisis and the like.  But compared to other advanced industrial countries—Europe, the U.K., Japan—compared to other countries and advanced industrial countries recovering from financial crises, the U.S. recovery has actually been better than most.  It’s not been good, it’s not been satisfactory.  Obviously, we still have a labor market where it’s not easy for people to find work.  A lot of young people can’t get the experience and entrée into the labor market.  But, I think, given all of the things that we faced, it’s perhaps, at least in retrospect, not shocking that the recovery has been somewhat tepid. December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.com.  You just talked a little bit about fiscal policy and now Congress has—is set to pass a budget deal, and they haven’t really done much to reduce the deficit.  And it looks like they’re not going to do anything until after the next presidential election.  So, could you talk a little bit about that?  You’ve been pressing for a bigger deal and reducing the U.S. debt burden.  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as always, of course, I don’t address specific fiscal actions.  I will say a couple of things about this deal.  One is that, relative to where we were in like it’s going to pass both houses of Congress.  It’s also, at least directionally, what I have recommended in testimony, which is that it eases a bit the fiscal restraint in the next couple of years, a period where the economy needs help to finish the recovery.  And, in place of that, it achieves savings further out in the 10-year window.  So those things are positive things.  Of course, there’s a lot more work to be done, I have no doubt about that.  But it’s certainly a better situation than we had in September and October, or in January during the fiscal cliff, for that matter.  And I think it will be good for confidence if fiscal policy and congressional leaders work together to—even if there’s—even if the outcomes are small, as this one was, it’s a good thing that they are working cooperatively and making some progress. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Chairman Bernanke, Donna Borak with American Banker.  As you look back on the regulatory reform effort over the last several years—the rules that have been completed, those that have yet to be finalized—what rules would you have liked to have seen tougher?  And ones that, perhaps, you would have liked to have seen finished before you leave?  And as someone that has been a steward of the financial crisis and the reform effort, as you leave now, do you feel that the safeguards are now in place, that the system is safer? December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, the system is certainly safer, and one indication of that is the amount of capital that large banks hold.  So, for example, on the capital side, we have imposed Basel III requirements, much tougher requirements, as you know, for the large banks, with surcharges that will be part of that process.  We’ve imposed—I think one of the main innovations, which I am very pleased with, is the use of stress testing, trying to see whether banks have enough capital not only to deal with normal fluctuations, but to deal with the very severe combination of a sharp downturn in the economy and very bad financial conditions.  And I think that has been a very important test, both of banks’ abilities to survive a bad situation but also their abilities to measure their risks, which was something that was very deficient going into the crisis.  Beyond that, we’re looking at a leverage ratio, of course, that we expect to complete fairly soon, the possibility of having debt required at the holding company to assist in a resolution, we’re looking at capital for—to backstop firms that rely heavily on short-term wholesale funding.  So there’s a much stronger capital-oriented drive at this point to strengthen our financial system—and that’s just one dimension.  And then there’s liquidity and many other aspects.  I think, you know, it’s not really up to me to say whether these things are tough enough or not.  I mean, you and other observers who are writing about this and thinking about this obviously will have your opinions.  But, I guess, what I would say about that is that we’re not done.  We have still some important rules to complete, although all of them are well advanced.  And as we get these rules done and implement them, I’m sure they’ll make a very substantial difference in the safety of the system, but whether more needs to be done—I’ll leave that as an open question, and I think we’ll be working on this for some time.

PETER COOK.  Peter Cook of Bloomberg Television.  Mr. Chairman, first of all, thank you for holding these news conferences.  I hope you encourage your successor to have even December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL more of them.  One thing I know you’re going to miss is traveling to Capitol Hill to testify, and one thing that’s going to be happening next year, according to the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, is a full review of the Federal Reserve—even the Federal Reserve Act, the structure of the Fed, the mission of the Fed, and the mandate of the Fed.  And I wanted to see if you might be willing to impart some final words of wisdom to members of Congress as they consider possible legislative changes.  What, if anything, could they do to the structure of the Federal Reserve, the mandate of the Federal Reserve—the dual mandate—that might help Fed policy makers in the future?  Do you think the dual mandate still is merited?  And just a final question for you, sir, as you get set to leave and perhaps your last news conference here—you talked a little bit about your frustrations, the headwinds that you faced through the course of your eight years.  Is there a decision—with the benefit of hindsight—that you would do differently, one change perhaps in a decisionmaking process that you’ve made, your fellow colleagues have made here, that you think would have made a difference materially over the last eight years? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, on the centennial review, let me just say, first, that one of the things that I’m proud of, and I’ve tried to accomplish over the past eight years, is to increase the transparency of the Fed and to increase the accountability of the Fed.  You mentioned those trips to Capitol Hill.  I’ve testified many times, as have a number of my colleagues.   There is this notion that the Fed is not audited or it has all kinds of secret books—all these things.  As you well know, we have complete openness to the General Accountability Office, the GAO—Government Accountability Office.  We have an IG, Inspector General, of our own.  We have a private accounting firm that does all the books as well under very tough standards.  We publish regular reports on all aspects of our operations.  So we’re very open, and December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL we are by all means willing to work with Congress to see if there’s anything that they think might be done better or in a more effective way.  So, we’re open to doing that.   I hope that those reviewing the central bank will, of course, recognize that central banking is an old activity.  The 17th century is when the Swedish Riksbank and the Bank of England began operation, so we know a lot about central banking.  There are a lot of experts on central banking, a lot of experts on monetary policy.  Every major country has a central bank.  So we’re not starting from scratch.  I mean, there are a lot of people with a lot of expertise on this, and I hope that, as we talk about these issues, that we are bringing in serious people who understand these issues and who can make good suggestions.   Now, there are a range of different mandates around the world.  There are some single mandates, there are some dual mandates, et cetera.  It’s our sense that the dual mandate has served us well here—in particular, that the Fed has been able, at times, to speed the recovery from recession and help put people back to work more quickly.  Of course, we can’t do anything about long-run employment opportunities, but we can help the economy recover more quickly.  So I think that that’s valuable.  I would note, by the way, that at the current moment, it doesn’t really matter whether we have one mandate or two, because we’re below our inflation target and we—unemployment is above where we’d like it to be.  So both sides of our mandate are pointing exactly in the same direction, which is to provide strong accommodation to the economy to help it recover.   Looking in retrospect, I—you know, that’s a very hard question.  Every decision you make, of course, is done in real time, with deficient information and whatever you know at the time and whatever the experts are telling you about any particular issue.  Obviously, we were slow to recognize the crisis.  I was slow to recognize the crisis.  In retrospect, it was a traditional December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL classic crisis, but in a very, very different guise:  different types of financial instruments, different types of institutions, which made it, for a historian like me, more difficult to see.  Whether or not we could have prevented or done more about it, that’s another question.  You know, by the time I became Chairman, it was already 2006, and house prices were already have recognized that earlier and try to take more preventive action.  That being said, we’ve done everything we can think of, essentially, to strengthen the Fed’s ability to monitor the financial forward, we’re much better prepared for—to deal with these kinds of events than we were when I became Chairman in 2006.

KEVIN HALL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Kevin Hall with McClatchy Newspapers.  I want to indulge in a local question and a broader question.  As the paper that owns the South Carolina papers, I think there’s a lot of interest as to whether you’re going to retire to Dillon, South Carolina, and write your kiss-and-tell book.  But do you envision any role for yourself in South Carolina, post-chairmanship?  And then the broader question—your predecessor, Dr. Greenspan, in his new book argues that long-term investment—one of the reasons we may be seeing such a slow economy is that people are afraid debt and deficits are reducing long-term investment.  People are—companies are investing in the sorts of things that make them leaner, get by with fewer people, but the kind of expansion, we’re not seeing.  Do you feel that debt and deficits are weighing down these sorts of long-term decisionmaking, and does it argue for more drastic action on the short-term? 

[SECTION]

KEVIN HALL.  Yes.

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER.  [Inaudible remark] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay, good.   But I think for the immediate future, my wife and I, I believe, will stay in Washington for a bit of time.   About investment, I think there are a lot of reasons why investment is weaker than we would like.  I think the first and most important reason is, the recovery is slow.  I mean, investment is driven by sales, by the need for capacity.  And, you know, with a slow-growing GDP, slow-growing economy, most firms do not yet feel that much pressure on their capacity to do major, new projects.  There’s also a variety of uncertainties out there—fiscal, regulatory, tax, and so on—that no doubt affect some of these calculations.  We hear that from our FOMC participants around the table as they report from their local Districts.  So I think there are a lot of factors. Usually, you think that the way that a deficit or a long-term debt would affect investment would be through what’s called “crowding out”—that is, raising interest rates.  But high interest rates—we may have many problems, but high interest rates is not our problem right now.  There’s plenty of—particularly for larger firms—there’s plenty of credit available at low interest rates.  And we intend, of course, to try to continue to provide that to help the economy grow and to stimulate investment spending.  But I think that it’s going to take faster overall growth to get firms trying to expand capacity, and I think if we—if consumer spending increases, as we think it December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL will, and if exports increase, as they seem to be doing, then we’ll probably see greater investment as well. 

[SECTION]

STEVE BECKNER.  Steve Beckner of MNI.  Mr. Chairman, it’s been a pleasure covering you.  One of the factors that your policy statement says will be considered in assessing the future pace of asset purchases is the cost and efficacy of those purchases.  To what extent has the—or you might say, cost and benefits—to what extent has that calculation already changed?  To what extent did that affect today’s decision?  And, going forward, looking on the cost side, somebody else mentioned bubbles.  Not just bubbles, but to what extent will, you know, the whole consideration of threats to financial stability come into play, as well as the potential for losses on the Fed’s own portfolio? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So I will answer your question, and I’ll try and help maybe do a better job on Binya’s question as well.  We do think, again, of the asset purchases as a secondary tool behind interest rate policy, and we do think that the cost–benefit ratio, particularly as the assets on the balance sheet get large, that it moves in a way that’s less favorable.  The costs involved include, you know, managing the exit from that.  The possible—it’s very unlikely that the Fed will have losses in any comprehensive sense.  We’ve already put $350 billion of profits back to the Treasury since 2009, which is about as much as we delivered to the Treasury between 1990 and 2007 combined.  So, over any period of time, clearly, the Fed is actually making a good bit of money for the taxpayer and for the government.  But it could be that if interest rates rise quickly, for example, that we would be in a situation of not giving remittances to the Treasury for a couple of years, and that would create problems, no doubt, for the Fed in terms of congressional response.   December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL There are issues of how well we understand and can manage the effects of asset purchases.  I think, for example, that an important difference between asset purchases and interest rate policy is that asset purchases work by affecting what is called the “term premium,” which is essentially the additional part of the interest rate which investors require as compensation for holding longer-term securities.  We just don’t understand very well—and when I say “we,” I mean the economics profession—don’t understand very well what moves the term premium.  And so, we saw last summer—we saw a very big jump in the term premium that was very destabilizing and created a lot of stress in financial markets.  So there are a number of reasons why asset purchases, while effective, while I think they have been important, are less attractive tools than traditional interest rate policy, and that’s the reason why we have relied primarily on interest rates, but used asset purchases as a supplement when we’ve needed it to keep forward progress.   I think that, you know, obviously there are some financial stability issues involved there.  We look at the possibility that asset purchases have led to bubbly pricing in certain markets or in excessive leverage or excessive risk-taking.  We don’t think that that’s happened to an extent which is a danger to the system, except other than that when those positions unwind, like we saw over the summer, they can create some bumpiness in interest rate markets, in particular.  Our general philosophy on financial stability issues is, where we can, that we try to address it first and foremost by making sure that the banking system and the financial system are as strong as possible—if banks have a lot of capital, they can withstand losses, for example—and by using whatever other tools we have to try to avoid bubbles or other kinds of financial risks.  That being said, I don’t think that you can completely ignore financial stability concerns in monetary policy because we can’t control them perfectly, and there may be situations when financial instability December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL has implications for our mandate, which is jobs and inflation, which we saw, of course, in the Great Recession.  So it’s a very complex issue.   I think it will be many years before central banks have completely worked out exactly how best to deal with financial instability questions.  Certainly, the first line of defense for us is regulatory and other types of measures, but we do have to pay some attention to that.  I would say at this point, though, that the asset purchases program—the last one—is well on its way to meeting our economic objective, and I am very pleased that we’re able to, over time, wind down this program, slowing the pace of purchases on current plans, because we reached our objective rather than because the costs or efficacy issues became important.  So I think that, in this case, that that’s not a concern at this juncture with respect to this program. 

[SECTION]

ANNALYN KURTZ.  Annalyn Kurtz with CNN.  I recall in Jackson Hole last year, you cited a study that said the first $2 trillion in asset purchases had boosted GDP by about 3 percent and increased private-sector employment by 2 million jobs.  Now your balance sheet is nearing $4 trillion, and I’m wondering, do you feel the third round of asset purchases packed as much bang for your buck?  And do you still think the first study offered a reasonable estimate? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it’s very hard to know—in terms of the study, it’s very hard to know.  It’s an imprecise science to try to measure these effects.  You have to obviously ask yourself, you know, what would have happened in the absence of the policy?  I think that study—I think it was a very interesting study, but it was on the upper end of the estimates that people have gotten in a variety of studies looking at the effects of asset purchases.  That being said, I’m pretty comfortable with the idea that this program did, in fact, create jobs.  I cited some figures.  To repeat one of them, the Blue Chip forecasts for unemployment in this current quarter—made before we began our program—were on the order 7.8 percent, and that December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL was before the fiscal cliff deal, which even—created even more fiscal headwinds for the economy.  And, of course, we’re now at 7 percent.  I’m not saying that the asset purchases made all that difference, but it made some of the difference, and I think it has helped create jobs.   And you can see how it works.  I mean, the asset purchases brought down long-term interest rates, brought down mortgage rates, brought down corporate bond yields, brought down car loan interest rates, and we’ve seen the response in those areas as the economy has done better.  Moreover, again, this has been done in the face of very tight, unusually tight fiscal policy for a recovery period.  So I do think it’s been effective, but the precise size of the impact is something I think that we can very reasonably disagree about, and that work will continue on.  As I said before, the uncertainty about the impact and the uncertainty about the effects of ending programs and so on is one of the reasons why we have treated this as a supplementary tool rather than as our primary tool. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Don Lee, L.A. Times.  Unemployment benefits, as you know, are expiring shortly for more than a million people, and many more people will see their benefits end next year.  How much of an economic impact do you see that having?  And, secondly, what effect would you expect that will have on the unemployment rate?  Could it—if those people drop out of the labor force, then could that knock the employment rate down quite a bit? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  Well, obviously it has a big economic effect on those directly affected, you know, who are receiving benefits, and we do have an unusually large number of long-term unemployed people in the United States now, which is obviously a major concern and one that I cited in my opening remarks.  The effects of ending extended unemployment benefits, quantitatively, for the economy overall, are probably not very large because they work in two directions.  On the one hand, by putting the benefits into the system, December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL you are providing additional income.  That income is spent.  People receiving unemployment benefits obviously tend to spend a very high fraction of their income.  That is a positive for growth.  On the other side, it—probably some folks who are—can no longer qualify for unemployment benefits will just drop out of the labor force, and that will bring the unemployment rate down, but, for some sense, the wrong reason.  So, overall, it will have—it could have a very small effect on the measured unemployment rate.  But, again, I think that issue needs to be discussed more in terms of the impact on those most directly affected rather than on the overall economy. 

[SECTION]

KATE DAVIDSON.  Hi.  Kate Davidson from Politico.  This is a bit of a follow-up to an earlier question.  You talked about this centennial review of the Fed that the House is undertaking.  And the Fed, of course, has been under a lot of scrutiny, and you spoke recently about the importance of the Fed standing up to political pressure.  So I just wondered what advice you have, or what advice you’ve already given, to Janet Yellen when it comes to dealing with Congress. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Excellent question.  Well, I think the first thing to agree to is that Congress is our boss.  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency within the government.  It’s important that we maintain our policy independence in order to be able to make set our structure, to set our mandate, and that’s entirely legitimate, and we need to go and explain ourselves.  We need to explain why certain approaches are not so good or might be better.  But, obviously, they represent the public, and they certainly have every right to set the terms on which the Federal Reserve operates and so on.   December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL That being said, I think that we are, in fact, an effective central bank, that we are near the frontier in terms of transparency, in terms of the effectiveness of our policies.  We’re highly respected among central bankers and other policymakers around the world.  And so, I hope that when they do review the Fed, if that’s what they do, again, that they rely on expertise and highly qualified individuals who know the ins and outs of central banking and monetary policy, which are not simple matters.  And it would be very interesting to have a thorough discussion of many of the issues involved that the Fed has been engaged in.  But, again, I hope it will be on a high level that uses the best and most qualified people debating, you know, what changes, if any, are needed and—or, you know, what’s being done right. 

[SECTION]

MURREY JACOBSON.  Hi.  Murrey Jacobson with the NewsHour.  On the question of longer-term unemployment and the drop in labor force participation, how much do you see that as the result of structural changes going on in the economy at this point?  And to what extent do you think government can help alleviate that in this environment? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think a lot of the declines in the participation rate are, in fact, demographic or structural, reflecting sociological trends.  Many of the changes that we’re seeing now, we were also seeing to some degree even before the crisis, and we have a number of staffers here at the Fed who have studied participation rates and the like.  So I think a lot of the unemployment decline that we’ve seen, contrary to sometimes what you hear, I think a lot of it really does come from jobs as opposed to declining participation.   That being said, there certainly is a portion of the decline in participation, which is related to people dropping out of the labor force because they are discouraged, because their skills have become obsolete, because they’ve lost attachment to the labor force, and so on.  The Fed can address that, to some extent, if—you know, if we’re able to get the economy closer to December 18, 2013 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL full employment, then some people who are discouraged or who have been unemployed for a long time might find that they have opportunities to rejoin the labor market.   But I think, fundamentally, that training our workforce to fit the needs of 21st-century industry in the world that we have today is the job of both the private educational sector and the government educational sector.  We have many strengths in our educational sector, including outstanding universities, but we have a lot of weaknesses, as you know.  There are many, many factors that affect participation—employment, wages, and so on, but the one I think that we can most directly affect is the skill level of our workforce.  And that doesn’t mean everybody has to go to get a Ph.D.  People have different needs, different interests.  But that, I think, is one of the biggest challenges that our society faces, and if we don’t address it, then we’re going to see a larger and larger number of people who are either unemployed, underemployed, or working at very low wages, which obviously is not something we want to see. Thank you. ",Ben Bernanke,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
12,2014-03-19,"CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  I am pleased to join you for the first of my post-FOMC press conferences.  Like Chairman Bernanke before me, I appreciate the opportunity these press conferences afford to explain the decisions of the FOMC and respond to your questions. The Federal Open Market Committee concluded a two-day meeting earlier today.  As you already know from our statement, the Committee decided to make another modest reduction in the pace of its purchases of longer-term securities.  The Committee also updated its guidance regarding the likely future path of the short-term interest rates.  As I’ll explain more fully in a moment, this change in our guidance does not indicate any change in the Committee’s policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements; rather, the change is meant to clarify how the Committee anticipates policy evolving after the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent.  Let me explain the economic outlook that underlies these actions. Despite some softer recent data, the FOMC’s outlook for continued progress toward our goals of maximum employment and inflation returning to 2 percent remains broadly unchanged.  Unusually harsh weather in January and February has made assessing the underlying strength of the economy especially challenging.  Broadly speaking, however, the spending and production data, while somewhat weaker than we had expected in January, are roughly in line with our expectations as of December, the last time Committee participants submitted economic projections.  In contrast, labor market conditions have continued to improve.  The unemployment rate, at 6.7 percent, is three-tenths lower than the data available at the time of the December meeting.  Further, broader measures of unemployment—such as the U-6 measure, which includes marginally attached workers and those working part time but preferring full-time   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL work—have fallen even more than the headline unemployment rate over this period, and labor force participation has ticked up.  While the Committee continues to monitor developments in global financial markets carefully, financial conditions remain broadly consistent with the FOMC’s objectives.  In sum, the FOMC continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the economy to support ongoing improvement in the labor market. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  Given that longer-term inflation expectations appear to be well anchored, and in light of the ongoing recovery in the United States and in many economies around the world, the FOMC continues to expect inflation to move gradually back toward its objective.  The Committee is mindful that inflation running persistently below its objective could pose risks to economic performance.  The Committee also recognizes, however, that policy actions tend to exert pressure on inflation that is manifest only gradually over time.  The FOMC will continue assessing incoming data carefully to ensure that policy is consistent with attaining the FOMC’s longer-run objectives of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. This outlook is reflected in the individual economic projections submitted in conjunction with this meeting by the 16 FOMC participants—4 Board members and 12 Reserve Bank presidents.  As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.  The central tendency of the unemployment rate projections has shifted down by about two-tenths since December and now stands at between 6.1 and 6.3 percent at the end of this year.  The unemployment rate is projected to reach its longer-run normal level by the end of 2016.  The central tendency of the projections for real GDP growth stands at 2.8 to 3 percent for 2014 and remains somewhat above that of the estimates of longer-run normal growth through 2016.  Meanwhile, as I noted, FOMC participants continue to see inflation   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL moving only gradually back toward 2 percent over time as the economy expands.  The central tendency of the inflation projections is 1.5 to 1.6 percent in 2014, rising to 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016. Let me now return to our decision to make another measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases.  Starting next month, we will be purchasing $55 billion of securities per month, down $10 billion per month from our current rate.  Even after today’s action takes effect, we will continue to significantly expand our holdings of longer-term securities, and we will also continue to roll over maturing Treasury securities and reinvest principal payments from the FOMC’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  These sizable and still-increasing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and make financial conditions more accommodative, helping to support job creation and a return of inflation to the Committee’s objective. The FOMC views today’s decision to reduce the pace of asset purchases as consistent with the decisionmaking framework laid out last December and still in place today.  As before, if incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor markets and inflation moving back over time toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely continue to reduce the pace of asset purchases in measured steps at future meetings.  However, purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about the pace of purchases remain contingent on its outlook for jobs and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. Today the FOMC also updated its forward guidance regarding the path of short-term interest rates.  As emphasized in the statement, the new guidance does not indicate any change in   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL the policy intentions of the FOMC but instead reflects changes in the conditions we face.  Let me explain this more fully. In December 2012, the Committee first stated its guidance in terms of economic thresholds, stipulating that the current low range for the federal funds rate target would be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above our longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.  Since that time, progress in the labor market has been more rapid than we had anticipated, while inflation has been lower than the Committee had expected.  Although the thresholds served well as a useful guide to policy over the past year, last range for the federal funds rate would likely be maintained “well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.” Today the Committee has further revised its forward guidance to better reflect conditions as they now stand and are likely to evolve over coming quarters.  The revised formulation starts with a general description of the factors that drive FOMC decisionmaking and then provides the FOMC’s current assessment of what those factors will likely imply for the future path of short-term interest rates.  In particular, the Committee states that “[i]n determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, it [the Committee] will assess progress—both realized and expected—toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.”  In short, the larger the shortfall of employment or inflation from the respective objectives set by the FOMC, and the longer any such shortfall is expected to persist, the longer the target federal funds rate is likely to remain in the present 0 to ¼ percent range.    March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL The FOMC will base its ongoing assessment on a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. As I’ve noted, the FOMC’s assessment of these factors at present is consistent with the characterization provided in previous forward guidance.  The Committee continues to anticipate that conditions will likely warrant maintaining “the current range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.” The FOMC also supplemented its guidance pertaining to the period after the asset purchase program ends and the initial increase in the federal funds rate target has occurred.  The statement continues to note that in deciding on the pace for removing accommodation, the Committee will take a balanced approach to attaining its objectives.  The statement now adds the Committee’s current anticipation that “even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping” short-term interest rates “below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”  This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy as reported in the participants’ projections, which show the federal funds rate for most participants remaining well below longer-run normal values at the end of 2016.  Although FOMC participants provide a number of explanations for the federal funds rate target remaining below its longer-run normal level, many cite the residual impacts of the financial crisis, and some note that the potential growth rate of the economy may be lower, at least for a time.   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL In summary, the Committee’s actions today reflect its assessment that progress in the labor market is continuing, but that much remains to be done on both the jobs and inflation fronts.  Unemployment is still elevated, underemployment and long-term unemployment remain significant concerns, and inflation is running significantly below the FOMC’s objective.  These conditions warrant the continuation of highly accommodative policy reflected in today’s policy statement.  The Federal Reserve’s interest rate guidance and its substantial and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities will ensure that monetary policy remains highly accommodative, promoting the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Thank you.  I’ll be glad to take your questions. Could you give us a little insight in how the decision was made on dropping the 6½ percent numerical target in the forward guidance?  Was there any concern expressed that there’s been criticism on forward guidance, that it’s confusing markets, not helping them in some ways?  Was there concern expressed that perhaps it would have been better to go to just a lower target, say, 6 percent?  And could you also address the concerns raised in the dissent that by dropping this, it lowers the commitment on fighting low inflation?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thanks.  Well, as I mentioned in my statement, the reason the Committee felt that the time had come to revise the forward guidance is not because we think it has not been effective.  I believe the Committee does think it’s been effective.  I think it’s had a very useful impact in helping markets understand our expectations and shaping their own.  But it is becoming—as the unemployment rate gets closer and closer to 6½ percent, to breaching that threshold that seems like the one that is likely to be breached.  The question is:  Markets want to know, the public wants to understand, beyond that threshold, how will we decide what to do?   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL So the purpose of this change is simply to provide more information than we have in the past, even though it is qualitative information, about what we will be looking at as the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent in deciding how long to hold the federal funds rate at this 0 to ¼ percent range.  And, as I said, we’ve tried to give a general formulation of what we’ll be looking at, which is:  How far are we?  How large are the shortfalls in achieving our goals?  And how fast do we expect progress to be?  That will be the main factors we’ll be looking at.  We initially started with an unemployment rate as a threshold.  That was easy enough for the Committee to say, “With an unemployment rate above 6½ percent, we know we’re not close to full employment, not close to an employment level consistent with our mandate, and unless inflation were a significant concern, we wouldn’t dream of raising the federal funds rate target.”  Now, the Committee has never felt that the unemployment rate is a sufficient statistic for the labor market.  I think if I had to choose one indicator of the labor market, the unemployment rate is probably as good a one as I could find.  But in assessing the real state of slack in the labor result from that—it’s appropriate to look at many more things.  And that’s why the Committee now states we will look at a broad range of information.  So the closer we get as we narrow in on coming closer to the target we want to achieve, we will be carefully considering many indicators of how close are we to our targets.  So those are the main reasons.  Now, you asked as well about the dissent.  President Kocherlakota felt—I believe he noted in his dissent that he endorses the new guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate after we begin to finally raise it.  And that indicates that it’s unlikely to be back to normal levels for some time, but he questions whether or not the reformulated forward guidance shows   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL sufficient commitment of the Committee to its 2 percent inflation objective.  And I will simply say on my own behalf, and on behalf of the Committee, that we are fully committed to the 2 percent inflation objective, and we do not want to undershoot inflation for a prolonged period of time.  As I mentioned, monetary policy operates with lags, so, the policies we have in place, we think, will gradually—only gradually—move inflation back to 2 percent.  But if the Committee had real concerns that inflation were going to remain persistently below 2 percent, I feel confident that the Committee would act to prevent that. 

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Yellen, in the interest rate projections made by FOMC participants that supplement your statement, there seems to be a slight upward drift in the expectations for rates going out to 2016.  For instance, a majority of officials see rates at 1 percent or higher in this forecast round.  In the last forecast round, a majority saw officials less than 1 percent.  I wonder if you could explain why there is this small upward drift in expected rates among Committee members, whether these projections are a good guide for the public about where rates—about the path of rates going forward, and also how you reconcile this upward drift with the assurances that the Committee makes in its statement that rates will stay below normal levels well into the future. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, to my mind, there is only very limited upward drift.  You know, the Committee—I think the Committee, in assessing the economy—if you compare today’s assessment with December’s, is virtually identical.  Almost nothing has changed in the overall Committee assessment of the outlook.  As I mentioned, unemployment has come down.  The labor market more broadly, I think, has improved a little more than we might have expected, and that slightly more rapid improvement in the unemployment picture might explain—I can’t speak for why people write down what they do, but—a little bit of the upward shift in those dots.    March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL But, more generally, I think that one should not look to the dot plot, so to speak, as the primary way in which the Committee wants to or is speaking about policy to the public at large.  The FOMC statement is the device that the Committee as a policymaking group uses to express its opinions, and we have expressed a number of opinions about the likely path of rates.  In particular, the Committee has endorsed the view that it anticipates it will be a considerable period after the asset purchase program ends before it will be appropriate to begin to raise rates.  And, of course, on our present path, well, that’s not utterly preset.  We would be looking at next fall.  So, I think that’s important guidance.  Looking further out, let’s say if you look toward the end of 2016 when most participants are projecting that the employment situation—that the unemployment rate will be close to their notions of mandate-consistent or longer-run normal levels.  What you see, I think, if you look this time—if you gaze at the picture from December or September, which is the first year that we showed those dot plots for the end of 2016, is the massive points that are notably below what the participants believe is the normal longer-run level for nominal short-term rates, and the Committee today, for the first time, endorsed that as a Committee view.  So I think that’s significant.  I think that’s what we should be paying attention to, and I would simply warn you that these dots are going to move up and down over time a little bit this way or that.  The dots moved down a little bit in December relative to September, and they moved up ever so slightly.  I really don’t think it’s appropriate to read very much into it.  More generally, you know, the end of 2016 is a long way out.  Monetary policy will be geared to evolving conditions in the economy, and the public does need to understand that as those views evolve, the Committee’s views on policy will likely evolve with them.  And that’s a kind of uncertainty that the Committee wouldn’t want to eliminate completely from its guidance   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL because we want the policy we put in place to be appropriate to the economic conditions that will prevail years down the road. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  I wish to look not to the dots, but to the statement, as you suggest, Madam Chair, and that one particular paragraph, which says that the Committee anticipates a lower-than-normal rate even once you return to the long run.  So, just so I understand correctly, it means that once you hit the longer-run unemployment rate of 5—which is the central tendency average of being 5.4 percent—once you get a 2 percent inflation rate, the market should not, then, anticipate the longer-run 4 percent fed funds rate, and that would be question one.  Question two is, doesn’t that implicitly suggest a shallower glide path once you take off, or once fed funds rates would begin—when you first hike them?  Wouldn’t that suggest a shallower glide path to the funds rate? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes, I think it does suggest a shallower glide path, and what the Committee is expressing here, I would say, is its forecast of what will be appropriate some years from now based on its—the understanding that we’ve developed about what are the economic forces that have been driving economic activity.   We’ve had a series of years now in which growth has proven disappointing.  Now, members of the Committee have different views about why this is likely to be true, that the funds rate—when the labor market is normalized and inflation is back to our objective—they maybe have slightly different views on exactly why it’s likely to be the case that interest rates will be a little lower than they would in the longer run.  But for many, it’s a matter of headwinds from the crisis that have taken a very long time to dissipate and are likely to continue being operative.  So, some examples I would say is, we have under—many households are undergoing balance sheet repair.  There are many underwater mortgage holders, difficulties therefore in gaining access to   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL credit—for example, through home equity lines of credit.  For some, that makes it difficult to finance small businesses.  Mortgage credit is very difficult for those still to get without pristine credit scores.  That’s improved somewhat over time, but it’s not back to normal.  For some, fiscal policy is somewhat tighter than would be expected over the next several years.  For some, it’s headwinds from the global economy play a role as well.   But the general assessment is that even after we’ve had an accommodative monetary policy for long enough to get the economy back on track in the sense of meeting our objectives, the stance of policy that will be appropriate to accomplish that will be easier or involve somewhat lower than would be normal short-term interest rates.  Now, eventually, years later, most people think they will go back up.  But, as you said, that suggests the path will be gradual.  But I do want to emphasize, this is a forecast, and this is the Committee’s forecast based on its understanding of the economy at this time.  And as we watch the economy over the next several years, that could evolve.

YLAN MUI.  Hi, Ylan from the Washington Post.  You mentioned in your testimony on Capitol Hill recently that the Fed was trying to assess the balance of weather effects versus more fundamental weakness in the economy as the reason for the slowdown in growth in the first quarter, and you guys mentioned in the statement weather specifically.  Does that mean that the Fed’s analysis has come down on the side of weather, or are you still concerned that there could be something else going on that could be contributing to slower growth?  And you guys also lowered your forecast for GDP growth this year. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, I’d say, certainly the analysis that we’ve done—and we did spend a lot of time discussing weather and how it’s affected businesses and households in various parts of the country—certainly weather has played an important role in weakening economic activity   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL in Q1.  It’s not the only factor that is at work, and most projections for growth in the first quarter are reasonably weak.  It’s an important factor.  It’s not the only factor.  But I would say it’s likely in the view of most of the Committee to begin to wash out in the second quarter, and we can even see some rebound.  Now, I would say, I know what we’ve said about weather is a little bit complicated and confusing.  So, you know, let me just say between December and January, the Committee saw data that led it to be quite a bit more optimistic about the economic outlook.  So I would say incoming data since January, when our statement sounded quite an optimistic tone, partly down due to weather and partly down because we probably overdid the optimism in January.  So, in some sense, our views have moved around here a little bit, but if we take December to March, the Committee’s views are largely unchanged.

JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Hi, Madam Chairwoman.  I’m Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Times.  You’ve been on—you’ve served on the Fed previously.  I’m wondering, now, in the past few weeks as Chairwoman, what’s been different about being on the Fed in your responsibilities as Chair, compared to being just a Board of Governors member? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, thanks.  I feel I’m very lucky that I’ve had a lot of Fed experience to draw on as I approach this role because it’s complicated, and now in many ways I feel the buck stops with me in terms of management of the FOMC and responsibility to assure that the Federal Reserve makes progress on its goals of getting the economy back on track and making progress on our financial stability and regulation objectives.  So I feel that weight of responsibility keenly in the new role I have, and I’m very committed to making sure that I provide the leadership that’s necessary for the Federal Reserve System to move forward on these goals.  But, you know, in terms of the conduct of business, it’s pretty much the same as usual.    March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL I’m not envisioning, nor have there been so far, any radical changes in how the Federal Reserve does its business, and that includes operating the FOMC. 

[SECTION]

ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times.  Madam Chair, given that the new qualitative guidance doesn’t give any information about how you will trade off your unemployment and inflation objectives, does it actually give us any information?  How will you trade off the risk of higher inflation versus faster progress on unemployment as you get closer to full employment?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, I’d say so far we haven’t had that tradeoff to make because inflation is running well below our objective, and by any measure there remains substantial slack in the labor market.  So tradeoffs and worrying about doing more or less because we have conflicting objectives, this really has not been an element in our discussions about how to be conducting policy now.  As we get closer to meeting our goals, it could become an element, and I would say that we’ve given guidance in the statement—and we gave perhaps more guidance in our so-called consensus statement or statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategies that we’ve now reaffirmed for three years in a row—that the Committee would take a balanced approach in situations where our objectives conflict and we’re faced with tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment.   When we first put our thresholds into effect, we envisioned a possible situation where such a tradeoff could arise, where we might face a situation where unemployment was quite high—namely, over 6½ percent—and inflation might be drifting close to 2 or even a little bit above 2.  And our threshold-based guidance gave some more concrete indication that we would tolerate inflation running a little bit over 2 percent with unemployment sufficiently high before moving the federal funds rate off zero.  And to the extent that that concrete guidance is useful,   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL the—I don’t believe that’s a situation that we’re likely—if I thought that that was a situation we were likely to encounter in the next several years, we probably would have revised our forward guidance in a different way.  We revised it as we did, eliminating that language, because it doesn’t seem like a situation that’s at all likely.  But I would point you to the statement—the final statement in this statement that says that the FOMC does not see this guidance as indicating any change in our policy intentions, and I would include how we would make tradeoffs between our inflation and employment objectives if we were to face that situation. 

[SECTION]

ANN SAPHIR.  Ann Saphir with Reuters.  First, I just wanted a quick clarification.  You said that something would happen by next fall, and we—on a clear path—on a path until next fall.  I was unclear if you were speaking of rate hikes or if you were speaking— 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  I simply meant to say that if we continued to reduce the pace of our asset purchases in the manner that we have, in measured steps, that the program would be winding down next fall. 

[SECTION]

ANN SAPHIR.  In this coming fall, you mean, not the fall of next year, is that—just— 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes, this coming fall. 

[SECTION]

ANN SAPHIR.  To be clear—I just wanted to be clear about that.  Then once you do wind down the bond buying program, could you tell us how long of a gap we might expect before the rate hikes do begin? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, the language that we use in the statement is “considerable” period.  So, I—you know, this is the kind of term—it’s hard to define.  But, you know, it probably means something on the order of around six months or that type of thing.  But, you know, it depends.  What the statement is saying is, it depends what conditions are like.  We need to see where the labor market is, how close are we to our full employment goal—that will be a   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL complicated assessment not just based on a single statistic—and how rapidly are we moving toward it?  Are we really close and moving fast?  Or are we getting closer but moving very slowly?  And then, what the statement emphasizes, and this is the same language we used in 2 percent objective.  Inflation matters here, too, and our general principle tries to capture that notion.  If we have a substantial shortfall in inflation, if inflation is persistently running below our 2 percent objective, that is a very good reason to hold the funds rate at its present range for longer. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  The Committee’s Vice Chairman, Bill Dudley, said recently, “If the economy decided it was going to grow at 5 percent or the economy decided it wasn’t going to grow at all, those would be the kind of changes in the outlook that I think would warrant changing the pace of taper[ing].”  Is that an accurate description of what you mean when you say that you’re not on a preset course, anything between zero to five?  And, secondly, if I the level of inflation and that long-term unemployment seems relatively uncorrelated.  Is that the Fed’s view at this point?  Is that one reason that you expect inflation to rebound in the next couple of years? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I think the numbers you cited would be extremes in terms of defining what we’d need to see.  I wouldn’t go to such extremes.  I guess the way I would put it is this:  There are two conditions for the Committee to decide to continue tapering the pace of purchases.  The first is that we need to assess that the labor market continues to be on the mend and that we feel reasonably satisfied that the outlook is for further improvement in the labor   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL need to see—and now coming back to inflation again—inflation is low, and it’s been running well below our objective.  And we need to see evidence that leaves us feeling satisfied that inflation will move up over time, that we believe the evidence is consistent with its moving up over time.   If the Committee no longer feels comfortable making such assessments—so, if there is enough change in the data we’re seeing about the economy that it no longer seems reasonable or convincing to make those two separate assessments, then a case has been made to change the pace of asset purchases and to deviate from the current plan.  So 5 percent and 1 percent, those are very extreme numbers.  But I would want to feel confident in making those two statements about the labor market and inflation.   With respect to the issue of short-term unemployment and its being more relevant for inflation and a better measure of the labor market, I’ve seen research along those lines.  I think it would be tremendously premature to adopt any notion that says that that is an accurate read on either how inflation is determined or what constitutes slack in the labor market.  So I think this is something our Committee will be looking at, especially as unemployment goes down and other labor market indicators hopefully simultaneously improve.  We’ll be looking at a broad range of indicators.  We’re looking to see progress on many different dimensions where we see slack in the economy, but I wouldn’t endorse, and I certainly don’t think our Committee would endorse, the judgment of the research that you cited. 

[SECTION]

JEFF KEARNS.  Jeff Kearns from Bloomberg News.  You’ve spoken in the past about—thinking about back to March of last year—of how you supplement your view of the labor How has your dashboard evolved in the past few months in terms both of the—which indicators   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL you like to watch most, and also in terms of the quality of data that you think—whether it’s positive, negative—that you’re getting from these indicators.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I have talked in the past about indicators I like to watch or I think that are relevant in assessing the labor market.  In addition to the standard unemployment rate, I certainly look at broader measures of unemployment.  I mentioned U-6 in my statement.  It—5 percent of the labor force working part time on an involuntary basis, that’s an exceptionally high number relative to the measured unemployment rate, and it—so, to my mind, is a form of slack that is—adds to what we see in the normal unemployment rate and is unusually large.  However, it is coming down, as well as U-3.  It’s moving in the right direction and has moved even more recently than U-3.  Of course, I watch discouraged and marginally attached workers.  The share of long-term unemployment has been immensely high and can be very stubborn in bringing down, that’s something that I watch closely.  Again, that remains exceptionally high, but it has come down from something like 45 percent to high 30s, but that’s certainly on my dashboard.  Labor force participation—I do think most research suggests that due to demographic factors, labor force participation will be coming down, and there has been a downward trend now for a number of years.  But I think there is also a cyclical component in the fact that labor force participation is depressed.  And so, it may be that as the economy begins to strengthen, we could see labor force participation flatten out for a time as discouraged workers start moving back into the labor market.  And so that’s something I’m watching closely.   In the Committee, we’ll have to watch—there are different views on this within the Committee, and it’s hard to know definitively what part of labor force participation is structural versus cyclical, so it’s something to watch closely.  I’ve also mentioned, in the past, measures of labor market turnover.  You mentioned quits.  A remarkably large share of workers quit their   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL jobs every month, usually going directly into another job.  And I take the quit rate in many ways as a sign of the health of the economy.  When workers are scared they won’t be able to get other jobs, they show a reduced willingness to quit their jobs.  Now, quit rates now are below normal pre-recession levels, but on the other hand, they have come up over time, and so we have seen improvement.  The job opening rate has also come up.  The hires rate, however, remains extremely depressed, and I take that as a sign of a weaker labor market.  But most of these measures, although they don’t paint the identical extent of improvement, if you ask about my dashboard, the dial on virtually all of those things is moving in a direction of improvement.   The final thing I’d mention is wages, and wage growth has really been very low.  I know there is perhaps one isolated measure of wage growth that suggests some uptick, but most measures of wage increase are running at very low levels.  In fact, with the productivity growth we have and 2 percent inflation, one would probably expect to see, on an ongoing basis, something between—perhaps 3 and 4 percent wage inflation would be normal.  Wage inflation has been running at 2 percent.  So not only is it depressed, signaling weakness in the labor meaningful pressures on inflation, at least over time.  And I would say we’re not seeing that. 

[SECTION]

WYATT ANDREWS.  Madam Chair, Wyatt Andrews from CBS.  For tens of millions of Americans, the recovery is an awful long time coming.  May we know your thoughts on why the recovery is so slow, and why the economy is not creating more jobs? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think the short answer is that we have lived through a devastating financial crisis that has taken an exceptional toll on the economy in many different ways, from housing to leaving a huge number of homeowners with mortgages living in homes with mortgages that are underwater, has had a highly negative effect on their credit ratings and   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL their ability to access credit, has left businesses with very cautious attitudes that we see in business investment spending that is very restrained.  On top of that, we’ve had weakness in the global economy, and we’ve had a very tight fiscal policy at home.  After stimulus at the onset of the recession, we’ve had a good deal of fiscal consolidation in the United States and, at a time when fiscal policy normally in the past would have been serving to create jobs, fiscal policy from that standpoint has served as a headwind to the recovery.  And at the federal—especially at the federal level, but also with state and local levels as well.  And so we have had a disappointing recovery.  And monetary policy has tried to do what we can to offset that.  But, you know, the linkages aren’t as strong and aren’t as quick as we might ideally like them to be. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  I’d like to take you back to last summer when there were hints—the Fed made hints that they were going to taper, and long-term interest rates spiked, mortgage rates rose.  What lessons—looking back at that crisis, at that period, what lessons have you learned from it, and are you confident that you won’t repeat that—those mistakes again? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think there were quite a number of things happening at that time.  I think it’s probably true that monetary policy may have played a role in touching off that significant unwinding of carry trades and other leveraged positions that investors had taken, perhaps thinking that the level of volatility was exceptionally low and perhaps lower than was safe for them to have assumed.  But we certainly saw—now, in some ways, the fact that term premia in interest rates have come up somewhat, although it has had a negative effect on the recovery and that’s evident in housing—in the slowdown in housing—perhaps it’s diminished some financial instability risk that may have been associated with these carry trades and speculative activities that were unwinding during that time.  A lesson is that we will try, and we   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL were trying then, but we will continue to try to communicate as clearly as we possibly can about how we will conduct monetary policy and to be as steady and determined and as transparent as we can to provide as much clarity as is reasonably certain—given that the economic developments in the economy are themselves uncertain—but we will try as hard as we can not to be a source of instability here. 

[SECTION]

REBECCA JARVIS.  Madam Chair, Rebecca Jarvis, ABC News.  One of the drivers last spring and summer of home prices and home sales was that sense that interest rates were going up, that they were spiking.  And now, a year later, we’re looking essentially at a flat interest rate picture as far as homebuyers are concerned.  So, is there any sense on your Committee that staying at this level loses its punch the longer we remain here?  And if I’m a buyer, and I’m thinking about going out and buying a home, why should I do that today as opposed to waiting a few more years or even months before interest rates then do go up? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think the level of interest rates remains low by historic levels.  And the level of household formation is very depressed, has been very depressed for some time.  There are a lot of kids who were shacking up with their families and probably would like to be going out and acquiring places of their own, whether it’s an apartment or a home.  There’s a lot of demographic potential there for new household formation that would ultimately generate new construction, either single or multifamily, and the level of rates I think does matter.  And the fact that they’re low now, I think, is something that should serve as a stimulus to people coming back into the housing market.  And what we’ve not yet seen—the pickup after the lull—after interest rates went up last summer, I do expect housing activity to begin to expand more rapidly later on.  I don’t think it’s only the expectation that “I have to move now or things will be more expensive later” that spurs those decisions.  So—   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL

KATE DAVIDSON.  Hi, Kate Davidson from Politico.  Much has been made about the fact that you and your predecessor agreed on many policies.  You shared a lot of the same policy views.  Can you tell us one way in which your chairmanship will be different than Ben Bernanke’s? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think we are committed to exactly the same set of goals.  And, you know, as I indicated, I—my goal, and I will, you know, throw myself into this as wholeheartedly as I can, is to make rapid progress, as rapid progress as we possibly can in getting this recovery back on track and putting Americans back to work and into jobs, and in moving inflation back up to levels at the Committee’s target of 2 percent.  My predecessor was also devoted to that.  Strengthening the financial system is a work in progress, and he made large inroads in strengthening the financial system.  I’d just say, there is more work to be done, I have a long to-do list.  I would absolutely—it’s high priority for me to see further work done in addressing too-big-to-fail.  We have a to-do list of things we want to accomplish, and in assessing threats to financial stability because neither one of us—and no one wants to live through a financial crisis like the last one, and we want to be extremely cognizant of emerging threats to the financial system.  So I haven’t answered your question by saying that I will be different, but I think he had a very good agenda, and it’s one I shared.  It’s why I came to Washington to be Vice Chair, and it’s the agenda I expect to continue pursuing.

PETER BARNES.  Madam Chair, Peter Barnes of Fox Business.  I wanted to talk about international developments and the crisis in the Ukraine.  Is the crisis a headwind for the U.S. economy?  Are there risks to the U.S. economy and the U.S. banking system, directly and indirectly?  And did the Russians move $100 billion in U.S. Treasury securities out of the United   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL States in the last couple of weeks to avoid U.S. sanctions?  Those are—those foreign securities are held by the Fed.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me start with the last piece of your question first.  I’m sorry, I—movements in custodial accounts at the New York Fed are something that I can’t—I’m not in the position to be able to comment about.  But in terms of the situation in Ukraine and Russia, it’s something that we’re monitoring very closely.  We discussed in our meeting the direct-trade linkages or exposures of the U.S. banking system to the Ukraine and Russia are not large.  That’s—we’re not seeing meaningful impacts now, but obviously there are geopolitical risks here that it’s very important for us to be attentive to and to keep our eye on.  And we’re not seeing broader global financial repercussions, but if this were to escalate, that would certainly be something that would be on our radar screen, but we’re not seeing—we’re not seeing that now and we’re monitoring it closely.

VICTORIA MCGRANE.  Victoria McGrane from Dow Jones Newswires.  You’ve spoken about how unemployment is more than just statistics to you.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I’d be surprised if anyone in this room doesn’t know someone who has been touched by the crisis, by unemployment, by difficulties in getting jobs, and that is true of me and my family and friends, I think, as it is probably for many of you.  I talk to a broad range of business contacts and try to stay in touch with what’s happening with real people in the economy.  We have—do a lot of work in community development in the Fed and have groups come to talk to us and explain to us how their communities have been affected by the economic   March 19, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL situation and by the housing crisis.  When I was in San Francisco, we worked—you know, we had programs there, we worked very closely, particularly in low-income communities that have been very badly affected, to design programs that could potentially be helpful.  We tried to study what kinds of programs can be most effective and to try to understand what kinds of advice we could give to those in the community development lending field to help.  So I do try to listen to people that represent communities that are experiencing the worst of the crisis and stay in touch with it that way. ",Janet Yellen,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
13,2014-06-18,"CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  The Federal Open Market Committee concluded its make another modest reduction in the pace of its purchases of longer-term securities.  The Committee maintained its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate target and reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. Today’s policy actions reflect the Committee’s assessment that the economy is continuing to make progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  In the labor market, conditions have improved further.  The unemployment rate, at 6.3 percent, is four-tenths lower than at the time of our March meeting, and the broader U-6 measure—which includes marginally attached workers and those working part time but preferring full-time work—has fallen by a similar amount.  Even given these declines, however, unemployment remains elevated, and a broader assessment of indicators suggests that underutilization in the labor market remains significant. Although real GDP declined in the first quarter, this decline appears to have resulted mainly from transitory factors.  Private domestic final demand—that is, spending by domestic households and businesses—continued to expand in the first quarter, and the limited set of indicators of spending and production in the second quarter have picked up.  The Committee thus believes that economic activity is rebounding in the current quarter and will continue to expand at a moderate pace thereafter.  Overall, the Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the economy to support ongoing improvement in the labor market.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, and the Committee remains mindful that inflation running persistently below its objective could pose  June 18, 2014  risks to economic performance.  Given that longer-term inflation expectations appear to be well Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL anchored, and in light of the ongoing recovery in the United States and in many economies around the world, the Committee continues to expect inflation to move gradually back toward its objective.  The Committee will continue to assess incoming data carefully to ensure that policy is consistent with attaining the FOMC’s longer-run objectives of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. This outlook is reflected in the individual economic projections submitted in conjunction with this meeting by the FOMC participants.  As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own views of appropriate monetary policy.  The central tendency of the unemployment rate projections is slightly lower than in the March projections and now stands at 6.0 to 6.1 percent at the end of this year.  From there, Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining to its longer-run normal level by the end of 2016.  The central tendency of the projections for real GDP growth is 2.1 to 2.3 percent for 2014, down notably from the March projections, largely because of the unexpected contraction in the first quarter.  Over the next two years, the projections for real GDP growth remain somewhat above the estimates of longer-run normal growth.  Finally, FOMC participants continue to see inflation moving only gradually back toward 2 percent over time as the economy expands.  The central tendency of the inflation projections is 1.5 to 1.7 percent in 2014, rising to 1.6 to 2 percent in As I noted at the outset, the Committee decided today to make another measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases.  Starting next month, we will be purchasing $35 billion of securities per month, down $10 billion per month from our current rate.  Even after today’s action takes effect, we will continue to expand our holdings of longer-term securities, and we 2016.  June 18, 2014  will also continue to roll over maturing Treasury securities and reinvest principal payments from Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL the FOMC’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  These sizable and still-increasing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and make financial conditions more accommodative, helping to support job creation and a return of inflation to the Committee’s objective. Today’s announced reduction in the pace of asset purchases reflects the Committee’s expectation that progress toward its economic objectives will continue.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor markets and inflation moving back over time toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely continue to reduce the pace of asset purchases in measured steps at future meetings.  However, as I have emphasized before, purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about the pace of purchases remain contingent on its outlook for jobs and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. Let me now turn to the framework we will be applying as we consider interest rate policy.  In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress—both realized and expected—toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This broad assessment will not hinge on any one or two indicators, but will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  Based on its current assessment of these factors, the Committee anticipates that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate, for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends,  June 18, 2014  especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL goal, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.  Further, once we begin to remove policy accommodation, it’s the Committee’s current assessment that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy as reported in the participants’ projections, which show the federal funds rate for most participants remaining well below longer-run normal values at the end of 2016.  Although FOMC participants provide a number of explanations for the federal funds rate target remaining below its longer-run normal level, many cite the residual effects of the financial crisis.  These include restrained household spending, reduced credit availability, and diminished expectations for future growth in output and incomes, consistent with the view that the potential growth rate of the economy may be lower for some time. Let me reiterate, however, that the Committee’s expectation for the path of the federal funds rate target is contingent on the economic outlook.  If the economy proves to be stronger than anticipated by the Committee, resulting in a more rapid convergence of employment and inflation to the FOMC’s objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target are likely to occur sooner and to be more rapid than currently envisaged.  Conversely, if economic performance disappoints, resulting in larger and more persistent deviations from the Committee’s objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target are likely to take place later and to be more gradual.  June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL Before taking your questions, I’d like to provide an update on the Committee’s ongoing discussions on the mechanics of normalizing the stance and conduct of monetary policy.  To be clear, these discussions are in no way intended to signal any imminent change in the stance of monetary policy.  Rather, they represent prudent planning on the part of the Committee and reflect the Committee’s intention to communicate its plans to the public well before the first steps in normalizing policy become appropriate. The Committee is confident that it has the tools it needs to raise short-term interest rates when it becomes appropriate to do so and to control the level of short-term interest rates thereafter, even though the Federal Reserve will continue to have a very large balance sheet for some time.  The Committee’s recent discussions have centered on the appropriate mix of tools to employ during the normalization process and the associated implications for the degree of control over short-term interest rates, the functioning of the federal funds market, and the extent to which the Federal Reserve transacts with financial institutions outside the banking sector.  The Committee is constructively working through the many issues related to normalization and will continue its discussions in upcoming meetings, with the expectation of providing additional details later this year. Thank you.  I’ll be happy to take your questions.

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  There is every reason to expect, Madam Chair, that the PCE inflation rate, which is followed by the Fed, looks likely to exceed your 2016 consensus forecast next week.  Does this suggest that the Federal Reserve is behind the curve on inflation?  And what tolerance is there for higher inflation at the Federal Reserve?  And if it’s above the 2 percent target, then how is that not kind of blowing through a target the same way  June 18, 2014  you blew through the 6½ percent unemployment target in that they become these soft targets?  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL Thanks.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, thanks for the question.  So I think recent readings on, for example, the CPI index have been a bit on the high side, but I think it’s—the data that we’re seeing is noisy.  I think it’s important to remember that, broadly speaking, inflation is evolving in line with the Committee’s expectations.  The Committee, it has expected a gradual return in inflation toward its 2 percent objective.  And I think the recent evidence we have seen, abstracting from the noise, suggests that we are moving back gradually over time toward our 2 percent objective, and I see things roughly in line with where we expected inflation to be.  I think if you look at the SEP projections that were submitted this time, you see very little change in inflation projections of the Committee.  

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  What about the tolerance for higher inflation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, the Committee has emphasized that we have the 2 percent objective for, as a longer-term matter, for PCE inflation and we would not willingly see a prolonged period in which inflation persistently runs below our objective or above our objective, and that remains true.  So that hasn’t changed at all in terms of the Committee’s tolerance for permanent deviations from our objective.  And we continue to see the data coming in, abstracting from the noise, in line with what we had expected, and continue to see a gradual pickup over the next several years toward our 2 percent objective.  

[SECTION]

ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times.  Madam Chair, could you comment a little bit more on the decline in the long-run interest rate projection?  Is that more to do with temporary headwinds from the recovery or is it something more permanent about the  June 18, 2014  economy?  And is this it, this decline to 3.75 percent?  Or do you think there’s potential for this Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL rate to go lower yet?  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, you do see a very slight decline this time in the Committee’s longer-term normal rate of interest projections.  You know, I would caution you, however, we’ve had turnover in the Committee—two new participants who joined and are submitting projections and two who departed—and that can create changes in the projections, small changes that are difficult to interpret.  But I think it’s fair to say there has been a slight decline.  And I think, you know, the most likely reason for that is there has been some slight decline, as I mentioned in my opening statement, of projections pertaining to longer-term growth, and typically estimates of the longer-run normal federal funds rate or short-term interest rates would move in line with growth projections. 

[SECTION]

YLAN MUI.  Hi, Ylan from the Washington Post.  My question is sort of the flip side of Steve’s, and it’s about your outlook for unemployment.  Your predecessor has said that the Fed has been consistently too pessimistic about the level of the unemployment rate, and today, you guys lowered your outlook again.  Can you tell me a little bit more about how you see the unemployment rate evolving to meet your forecast?  Why you believe the rate of decline will start to level off?  And what an unexpected drop might mean for the first rate hike. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, it’s true that unemployment has declined by more than the Committee expected and you do see a small downward revision in the Committee’s projections, at least the central tendency for the unemployment rate.  Now, first of all, I mean, the labor that is certainly sufficient to be diminishing labor market slack over time.  Over the last three months, for example, employment—payroll employment—has been rising around 230,000 jobs  June 18, 2014  per month and we’re running close to 200,000 over the last year.  So, it’s in no way surprising to Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL see a decline in the unemployment rate.  That said, many of my colleagues and I would see a portion of the decline in the unemployment rate as perhaps not representing a diminution of slack in the labor market.  We have seen labor force participation rate decline.  And while I think most of us would agree that there has been and will continue to be secular decline in the labor force participation rate for demographic reasons, I think a portion of the decline we’ve seen in the unemployment rate probably reflects a kind of shadow unemployment or discouragement, a cyclical part of labor force participation.  Now, if that’s correct, we may see that as the economy picks up steam and we see further recovery in the labor market, that those, let’s call them discouraged workers, will return either to unemployment or to employment.  And as labor force participation begins to stabilize, the unemployment rate will come down less quickly.  And I think for a number of people, that’s a component of the forecast. You asked about implications for the path of policy and I would just say, the guidance that we’ve given, our forward guidance, states that the timing of liftoff will depend on actual progress we see and the progress we expect to see going forward in terms of achieving both of our goals, namely maximum employment and our 2 percent inflation objective.  So, we’re not going to look at any single indicator like the unemployment rate to assess how we’re doing on meeting our employment goal; we will look at a broad range of indicators.  That said, as I tried to emphasize in my opening statement, there is uncertainty about monetary policy.  The appropriate path of policy, the timing in pace of interest rate increases, ought to and I believe will respond to unfolding economic developments.  If those were to prove faster than the Committee expects, it would be logical to expect a more rapid increase in the fed funds rate.  But the opposite also holds true.  If we don’t see the improvement that’s projected in the baseline outlook, that the  June 18, 2014  opposite would be true and the pace of the timing and pace of interest rate increases would be Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL later and more gradual. 

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Yellen, some Fed officials and some market commentators have noted that market conditions recently have looked a little bit like they did last spring before a period of turbulence.  Volatility is very low in stock and bond markets.  Risk premiums are very low, and in particular, the market expectations for interest rates, for short-term interest rates look below even the Fed’s own projections as laid out in your dot plot.  I wanted to ask two questions related to that.  One, what is your read on these—on market activity, and are you at all concerned about a sense of complacency in has laid out in its dot plot?  Or, is the market where you think the Fed is on that?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I mean, I’d start by saying that volatility, both actual and expected, in markets is at low levels.  The FOMC has no target for what the right level of volatility should be.  But to the extent that low levels of volatility may induce risk-taking behavior that, for example, entails excessive buildup in leverage or maturity extension, things that can pose risks to financial stability later on, that is a concern to me and to the Committee.  I don’t know whether a number of reasons have been cited for what we’re seeing in the guess I would say, it is important, as I emphasized in my opening statement, for market participants to recognize that there is uncertainty about what the path of interest rates—short-term rates—will be.  And that’s necessary because there’s uncertainty about what the path of the economy will be.  And I want to emphasize, as I have, that the FOMC will adjust policy to what it actually sees unfolding in the economy over time, and that necessarily gives rise to a certain  June 18, 2014  level of uncertainty about what the path of rates will be.  And it is important for market Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL participants to factor that into their decisionmaking.  You asked me about the dot plot—our forecast, or our projections, for the fed funds rate—and you do see a range of disagreement among the participants there, so by the time you get to 2016, there is a considerable range of opinion, and I think, in part, that reflects the uncertainty that I’m talking about—that participants do see different pace of recovery, different trajectories for inflation, and it’s appropriate for them to adjust their thinking about what the path of policy should be to their own view of how the economy will evolve over time.  And around each of those dots, I think every participant who’s filling out that questionnaire has a considerable band of uncertainty around their own individual forecast. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, New York Times.  You’ve spoken about the sense that the recession has done permanent damage to the economic output and you’ve reduced gradually over time your forecast of long-term growth.  I am curious to know to what extent you think stronger monetary and/or fiscal policy could reverse those trends.  Are we stuck with slower growth?  Is there something that you can do about it?  If so, what?  If not, why?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think part of the reason that we are seeing slower growth in potential output may reflect the fact that capital investment has been very weak during the downturn in the long recovery that we’re experiencing.  So, a diminished contribution from capital formation to growth does make a negative contribution to growth.  And as the economy picks up, I certainly would hope to see that contribution restored.  So, I think that’s one of the factors that’s been operative.  Of course, we’ve had unusually long duration unemployment.  A very large fraction of those unemployed have been unemployed for more than six months.  And there is the fear that those individuals find it harder to gain employment, that their attachment to  June 18, 2014  the labor force may diminish over time and the networks of contacts that are—they have that are Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL helpful in gaining employment can begin to erode over time.  We could see what’s known as hysteresis, where individuals, because they haven’t had jobs for a long time, find themselves permanently outside the labor force.  My hope would be that as—and my expectation is that as the economy recovers, we will see some repair of that, that many of those individuals who were long-term unemployed or those who are now counted as out of the labor force would take jobs if the economy is stronger and would be drawn back in again, but it is conceivable that there is some permanent damage there to them, to their own well-being, their family’s well-being, and the economy’s potential. 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I believe you mentioned in your opening remarks tighter credit, and I’m wondering what you think of the possibility that the Federal Reserve itself, with the regulations it has to impose under Dodd-Frank, is partly responsible for that.  And, second, the current trend toward litigation.  I recently read something where just the three largest banks in the U.S. have paid $51 billion dollars in fines so far, and obviously, the number is rising.  So, why would anybody loan to a near-prime borrower?  And, in fact, if you look at Federal Reserve Bank of New York research, here we are, five years into the expansion, and people below FICO of 700 are having worse credit experiences.  So it probably isn’t because, you know, unemployment’s declining.  It’s probably because banks simply don’t want to take the risk.  So, as the nation’s top bank regulator, what can you do to fix that?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, I first would start by saying that I really think it’s essential in the aftermath of this crisis to strengthen financial regulation and to make the financial system more robust and to reduce systemic risk.  We can see what the costs of the financial crisis were and I don’t think any of us should want to see that repeated.  So, I think the regulations that we’ve put  June 18, 2014  in place, most of which follow from Dodd-Frank, are highly appropriate to create a more robust Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL financial system that will be a safer and sounder one for our economy going forward, and I think we’re making progress on doing that.  In putting regulations into place, we have tried to phase them in, in a way that gives long enough lead times to make sure that in strengthening the financial system, we don’t produce a credit crunch.  And by and large, my own assessment is that credit is broadly available in the economy, but there are some exceptions, and I would agree with much of what you said when it comes to mortgage credit.  I think banks, at this point, are reluctant to lend to borrowers with lower FICO scores.  They mention in meetings with us consistently their concerns about putback risk, and I think they are—it is difficult for any homeowner who doesn’t have pristine credit these days to get a mortgage.  I think that is one of the factors that is causing the housing recovery to be slow.  It’s not the only one, but I would agree with that assessment.  And of course, you know, there were a lot of practices in connection with mortgage lending that really needed to be changed, we don’t want to go back to those days, but it is important to clarify—for us to work to clarify the rules around mortgage lending to create an environment of greater certainty for lenders to be willing to extend mortgage credit. 

[SECTION]

JASON LANGE.  Good afternoon, Jason Lange with Reuters.  Chair Yellen, the Fed has slashed its growth projections for this year, and you’ve gone to pains to explain that there is uncertainty in the path of interest rates in the economy, and yet the Fed central tendency projections for 2015 and 2016 remain quite strong.  Are you confident that the U.S. economy has entered a period of sustained above-trend economic growth?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, when you say “confident,” I suppose the answer is “no” because there is uncertainty, but I think there are many good reasons why we should see a period of sustained growth in excess of the economy’s potential.  We have a highly accommodative  June 18, 2014  monetary policy.  We have diminishing fiscal drag.  We have easing credit conditions.  We have Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL households who are becoming more comfortable with their debt levels and more able to service that debt, an improving job market.  We have rising home prices and rising equity prices and an improving global economy, at least in my estimation.  So I think all of those things ought to be working to produce above-trend growth and I think that’s what’s reflected in the forecast.  But, nevertheless, as I said, of course there is uncertainty around that projection.  You know, nevertheless, the labor market has continued to improve, and over a number of years in which, admittedly, growth has come in at a disappointing level, we’ve still seen the labor market broadly improve, and I expect that to continue.  

[SECTION]

STEVEN BECKNER.  Steve Beckner with MNI, Madam Chair.  You mentioned that there were discussions of the mechanics of normalization, as you put it.  I assume that that involved some review of the—it was the third anniversary of the June 2011 exit principles.  I wonder if I could get you to elaborate.  In particular, is the Committee reaching a consensus about the reinvestment and rollover policies, the timing of discontinuing those policies?  And I’d be interested in your personal view on that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, reinvestment policy was included in our 2011 exit principles, and it’s one of the things that we are discussing and reconsidering.  We have not yet reached— we’ve made quite a lot of progress in our discussion, but we’ve not yet reached conclusions about that or other aspects of our package.  There are a couple of things Chairman Bernanke indicated, in contrast to our 2011 principles, that we would be very unlikely to sell mortgage-backed securities, and that remains the case.  Broadly speaking, some of the principles that were incorporated in those—in that 2011 package, the notion that we fully expect our balance sheet to shrink considerably over time back toward more normal levels, toward levels that would be  June 18, 2014  consistent with efficiently conducting monetary policy, that’s still an expectation.  I believe it’s Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL an expectation that eventually our portfolio will be—consist largely of Treasuries, eventually, but there are quite a number of details.  We have a number—as you know, a number of tools that we can deploy as we move to normalize policy:  interest on excess reserves, our overnight RRP facility, term repurchase agreements with the markets, our Term Deposit Facility, and exactly how to deploy that set of tools to meet our objective of raising short—the general level of short-term rates when the time becomes appropriate, and how best to communicate to the public and to discussing and hope we will be able to come back with a full description, or let’s think of it as a revised set of exit principles, later this year. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Madam Chair, Donna Borak with American Banker.  One of the outstanding reform issues on the plate of the Fed is to handle the risk related to short-term wholesale funding.  You’ve been very supportive of this issue, but we’ve really heard little progress so far on where things stand.  Can you please explain to us why it’s taken so long to get this proposal out?  What are some of the aspects that the Fed is considering in their approach to how they roll out this rule, and where we may be in that process?  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I’m afraid that I can’t give you a detailed timetable for when we will move forward with that rule.  I’ve been supportive, Governor Tarullo and others have been supportive, of taking some action to diminish the incentives for heavy reliance on short-term funding.  We still see that as one of the risks to the financial system that wasn’t really addressed in the risk-based capital requirements that we put out or in the liquidity coverage ratio that’s out for proposal.  Governor Tarullo has suggested one approach could be to impose a capital requirement that’s related to reliance on wholesale funding, and in my own past comments, I’ve  June 18, 2014  been supportive, but I’m afraid at this point—and this remains very much on the table to take Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL some action to address this—it certainly remains on the table as an unfinished agenda item, but I don’t have a detailed timetable for you.  

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Would it be at some point before the end of the year, at least?  Can you say that much?  timetable for you, I’m sorry. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  I’m not—I’m just not certain.  I’m—I just don’t have a detailed 

[SECTION]

GREG IP.  Madam Chair, Greg Ip of the Economist.  This is partly a follow-up to Steve Liesman’s question.  How would the Committee respond if inflation did temporarily move above target in the near term before you achieve full employment?  Your colleague John Williams and the IMF have both suggested that the Committee might consider allowing inflation to temporarily overshoot because that might achieve a faster, larger improvement in employment.  Second question is:  Will financial stability considerations play a role in when and how fast the Committee normalizes interest rates?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So with respect to the question of overshooting, let me start by saying that inflation continues to run well below our objective, and we’re still some ways away from maximum employment.  And for the moment, I don’t see any tradeoff whatsoever in achieving our two objectives.  They both call for the same policy—namely, a highly accommodative monetary policy.  So, at best, overshooting of inflation or the thought that we will reach our inflation objective before we have attained maximum employment, I suppose I would see, at most, as a risk that we could face somewhere down the road.  Symmetrically, it’s also conceivably a risk that we would reach our maximum employment objective before we’ve actually attained our inflation objective.  So there are different ways in which we could  June 18, 2014  conceivably—or there could conceivably arise policy conflicts or tradeoffs somewhere down the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL road.  Now, quite some time ago, the FOMC adopted, and we reaffirmed just in January, a statement on our longer-run goals and policy strategy.  And what that statement said is that, first of all, whenever either inflation or employment are away from their preferred or mandate-consistent levels, it will always be the FOMC’s policy to make sure that we get back to those target levels over the medium term.  But a principle that’s embodied in that statement is that the Committee will follow a so-called balanced approach in deciding on its policies.  And, essentially, that means that when we see some conflict between achieving the two objectives, that we would consider in deciding on a policy just how far we are from achieving each of the objectives.  And if the distance from achieving an objective is particularly large, it would be consistent with a balanced approach that we would tolerate some movement in the opposite direction on the other objective.  But balanced approach is the general policy strategy I think we’d follow. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  I’d like to ask you about your signaling mechanism going forward.  At this point you haven’t decided on reinvestments.  You’ve told people, don’t pay any attention to the dot plot, and your two mandates, inflation and unemployment, are backward-looking lagging indicators.  So, if something should surprise in the economy with only four SEPs and press conferences a year, how do you signal to the markets what the Fed is doing so that you don’t run the risk of an event like last September when people were surprised, or some sort of credibility problem where people feel you’re falling behind the economy?   June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, you know, again, we are very attentive to unfolding economic developments and understand that there can be surprises and twists and turns in the road, so that the forecasts that we’ve made become no longer appropriate and we need to respond to unfolding developments.  I’m personally committed to communicating with the public whenever communication is appropriate.  We have four press conferences, but I would feel it appropriate for me to either have additional communications meetings with the press or to give speeches or to, in a variety of opportunities I have, to make clear what the Committee’s thinking is, and my colleagues as well, I think, would feel it entirely appropriate to communicate changes—changes in our views. 

[SECTION]

PEDRO DA COSTA.  Hi, I’m Pedro da Costa from Dow Jones Newswires.  Thank you very much.  Since we are currently having a World Cup, I thought it would be valid to ask a question about the world.  And I’m surprised—a little surprised at the optimism of your forecast given some, you know, the darkening outlook overseas.  You’ve got conflict in the Ukraine, escalation of war in Iraq with implications for oil prices that potentially have global economic impact.  You have—excuse me—a European recovery that’s still fairly weak, and emerging recovery globally?  And if I could just follow up very quickly on Greg’s question, because you talked about the two sides of the mandate, but you didn’t quite answer the financial stability part.  Do you think—is financial stability currently preventing the Fed from being more accommodative than it would like?  And if not, when do you expect that to happen, if at all?  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, let me—I’m sorry I didn’t answer the last part of Greg’s question and the last part of yours.  Let me start there.  With respect to financial stability, we monitor  June 18, 2014  potential threats to financial stability very, very carefully, and we have spoken about some—I’ve Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL spoken in recent congressional testimonies and speeches about some threats to financial stability that are on our radar screen, that we are monitoring.  Trends in leveraged lending and the underwriting standards there, diminished risk spreads in lower-grade corporate bonds—high-yield bonds—have certainly caught our attention.  There is some evidence of reach-for-yield behavior.  That’s one of the reasons I mentioned that this environment of low volatility is very much on my radar screen and would be a concern to me if it prompted an increase in leverage or other kinds of risk-taking behavior that could unwind in a sharp way and provoke a sharp, for example, jump in interest rates.  And we’ve seen what effect that can have on the global economy, and I think it’s something that it’s important to avoid.   But broadly speaking, if the question is, to what extent is monetary policy, at this time, being driven by financial stability concerns, I would say that—well, I would never take off the table that monetary policy should—could, in some circumstances, respond.  I don’t see them shaping monetary policy in an important way right now.  I don’t see a broad-based increase in leverage, rapid increase in credit growth or maturity transformation, the kinds of broad trends that would suggest to me that the level of financial stability risks has risen above a moderate level.  And we are using supervisory tools and regulations both to make the financial system more robust and to pay particular attention to areas where we’ve spotted concerns, like leveraged lending, which is very much a focus of our supervision. Now, let’s see.  There was a first part to your question, and the first part was about global risks, and we always pay attention to global risks and the likely evolution of the global economy.  You expressed a lot of pessimism about emerging markets, and I see it more likely that we’ll see moderate growth and a pickup there.  Of course, there are geopolitical risks—the Middle East,  June 18, 2014  developments in Iraq, of course.  They’re not only a humanitarian concern; they are a concern Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL with respect, potentially, to energy supplies and prices, and so I would certainly list that as something in the category of risks to the outlook.  

[SECTION]

PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes with Fox Business, ma’am.  Can I—just to follow up a little bit on what Pedro asked about.  Specifically, what about equity markets?  I mean, right now, today, the S&P 500 is on track to close at a—another record high.  You have said that you have not seen any evidence of bubbles in equity markets, and that they have been trading within historic norms.  Is that still the case today?  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I don’t have a sense—the Committee doesn’t try to gauge what is the right level of equity prices.  But we do certainly monitor a number of different metrics that give us a feeling for where valuations are relative to things like earnings or dividends, and look at where these metrics stand in comparison with previous history to get a sense of whether or not we’re moving to valuation levels that are outside of historical norms, and I still don’t see that.  I still don’t see that for equity prices broadly. 

[SECTION]

ANNALYN KURTZ.  Annalyn Kurtz with CNNMoney.  Thank you, Chair Yellen.  I’m wondering:  What’s the Fed’s general expectation for wage growth this year and next year?  And if inflation outpaces wage growth, does that scenario make you more hesitant to raise the federal funds rate next year?  Or if, conversely, wages rise just enough to keep up with inflation, they’re moving in lockstep, let’s say, is that enough to satisfy what you’re looking for in the job market?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, thanks.  That’s a great question.  You know, I see compensation growth, broadly speaking, as having been very well contained.  By most measures, compensation growth is running around 2 percent.  So that’s real wage growth or real compensation growth that’s essentially flat rather than rising, and real wage growth really has  June 18, 2014  not been rising in line with productivity.  My own expectation is that as the labor market begins Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL to tighten, we will see wage growth pick up some to the point where real wage growth, where compensation or nominal wages are rising more rapidly than inflation, so households are getting a real increase in their take-home pay.  And within limits—well, that might be signs of a tighter labor market.  Within limits, it’s not a threat to inflation because consistent with the level of inflation we have for our 2 percent inflation objective, we could see wages growing at a more rapid rate and—a somewhat more rapid rate—and, indeed, that would be part of my forecast of what we would see as the labor market picks up.  If we were to fail to see that, frankly, I would worry about downside risk to consumer spending.  So I think part of my confidence in the fact that we’ll see a pickup in growth relates to the fact that I think consumer spending will continue to grow at a healthy rate.  And, in part, that’s premised on some pickup in the rate of wage growth so that it’s rising greater—more than inflation. repeated a phrase that’s been used—that the Committee has been using, that there’s likely to be a “considerable” period between the end of the bond purchases and the first hike in the federal funds rate.  In March, you gave us some guidance to help—trying to help us to understand that by saying that that—it’s hard to define, but it could mean six months.  Is that a time frame that you feel—still feel comfortable with?  And, if you feel like it needs to be modified, do you—could you give us an assessment of—the market seemed to expect a rate, the first rate hike in the second half of next year.  Is that a good assessment?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So what I want to say, the guidance that I want to give you, is that there is no mechanical formula whatsoever for what a “considerable time” means.  The answer as to what it means is, it depends.  It depends on how the economy progresses.  The Committee said  June 18, 2014  very clearly in their statement that what they would be looking at and deciding on the timing of Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL interest rate increases would be the progress we’re making in achieving our objectives, how far we are from achieving our labor market objective and our inflation objective, and that we will be assessing that progress, and that’s the key determinant of when interest rate increases are likely to come.

CHAIR YELLEN.  There is no mechanical formula.

There was a report this week, in a salmon-colored newspaper I won’t mention, that the Fed is thinking about—and regulators in Washington are thinking about—an exit fee for bond mutual funds.  This has sparked a lot of comments.  Would you care to comment on this?

CHAIR YELLEN.  I am not aware of any discussion of that topic inside the Federal Reserve, and my understanding is that that is a matter that is under the purview of the SEC.  ",Janet Yellen,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
14,2014-09-17,"CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  The Federal Open Market Committee concluded its meeting earlier today and, as usual, released its monetary policy statement.  The Committee also released a document describing the approach the Committee intends to take when, at some point in the future, it becomes appropriate to begin normalizing the stance of policy.  Let me underscore that our release of this information is not meant to convey any change in the stance of policy.  As you know, the FOMC’s views on policy are conveyed in the policy statement, which I will now discuss before coming back to our normalization plans.  As indicated in our policy statement, the FOMC decided to make another reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.  The Committee also maintained its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate target and reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.  Let me discuss the economic conditions that underpin these actions. The economy is continuing to make progress toward the FOMC’s objective of maximum sustainable employment.  In the labor market, conditions have improved further in recent months.  Although the pace of job growth has slowed some recently, job gains have averaged more than 200,000 per month over the past three months.  The unemployment rate was 6.1 percent in August, two-tenths lower than the data available at the time of the June FOMC meeting.  Broader measures of labor market utilization, such as the U-6 measure, have shown similar improvement, and the labor force participation rate has flattened out.  These developments continue the trend of gradual progress toward our employment objective.  But the labor market has yet to fully recover.  There are still too many people who want jobs but cannot find them, too many who are working part time but would prefer full-time work, and too many who are not searching for a job but would be if the labor market were stronger.  As noted in the September 17, 2014  FOMC statement, “a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  underutilization of labor resources.” The Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the economy to support ongoing improvement in the labor market.  Although real GDP rose at an annual rate of only about 1 percent in the first half of the year, that modest gain reflected, in part, transitory factors, including a dip in net exports.  Indeed, private domestic final demand—that is, spending by domestic households and businesses—grew about twice as fast as GDP.  Indicators of spending and production for the third quarter suggest that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace, and the Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of growth going forward.  Inflation has been running below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, but with longer-term inflation expectations appearing to be well anchored and the economic recovery continuing, the Committee expects inflation to move gradually back toward its objective.  Moreover, inflation has firmed some since earlier in the year, and the Committee believes that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished.  As is always the case, the Committee will continue to assess incoming data carefully to ensure that policy is consistent with attaining the FOMC’s longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. This outlook is reflected in the individual economic projections submitted in conjunction with this meeting by the FOMC participants, which, for the first time, go through 2017.  As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.  The central tendency of the unemployment rate projections is slightly lower than in the June projections and now stands at 5.9 to 6.0 percent at the end of this year.  Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining to its longer-run normal level over the course of 2016 and edging a bit below that level in 2017.  The central tendency of September 17, 2014  the projections for real GDP growth is 2.0 to 2.2 percent for 2014, down slightly from the June   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  projections.  Over the next three years, the projections for real GDP growth run somewhat above the estimates of longer-run normal growth.  Finally, FOMC participants continue to see inflation moving gradually back toward 2 percent.  The central tendency of the inflation projections is 1.5 to 1.7 percent in 2014, rising to 1.9 to 2 percent in 2017. As I noted earlier, the Committee decided today to make another reduction in the pace of asset purchases.  Two years ago, when the FOMC began this purchase program, the unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent, and progress in lowering it was expected to be much slower than desired without additional policy accommodation.  The intent of the program was to achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market and to ensure that inflation was moving back toward the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent.  In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor persistently below 2 percent having diminished somewhat, we have reduced our pace of asset purchases again at this meeting.  Starting next month, we will be purchasing $15 billion of securities per month, down $10 billion per month from our current rate.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in the labor market and inflation moving back over time toward its 2 percent longer-run objective, the Committee will end this program at our next meeting. The Committee will continue its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from holdings of agency debt and MBS.  The Committee’s sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial September 17, 2014  conditions and promote further progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  inflation of 2 percent.   Regarding interest rates, the Committee reaffirmed its forward guidance “that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.”  This judgment is based on the Committee’s assessment of realized and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation—an assessment that is based on a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  Further, once we begin to remove policy accommodation, it is the Committee’s current assessment that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy as reported in the participants’ projections.  As I will explain in a moment, the FOMC now anticipates that it will continue to establish a target range, rather than a single point, for the federal funds rate when normalization begins, and the dots in the chart I’ve distributed now show, for each participant, the midpoint of this target range.  Notably, although the central tendency of the unemployment rate in late 2016 is slightly below its estimated longer-run value, and the central tendency for inflation is close to our 2 percent objective, the median projection for the federal funds rate at the end of 2016, at 2.9 percent, remains nearly a percentage point below the longer-run value of 3¾ percent or so projected by most participants.  Although FOMC participants provide a number September 17, 2014  of explanations for the federal funds rate running below its longer-run normal level at that time,   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  many cite the residual effects of the financial crisis, which, although slowly diminishing, are likely to continue to restrain household spending, constrain credit availability, and depress expectations for future growth in output and incomes.  As these factors dissipate further, most participants expect the federal funds rate to move close to its longer-run normal level by the end Let me reiterate, however, that the Committee’s expectations for the path of the federal funds rate are contingent on the economic outlook.  If the economy proves to be stronger than anticipated by the Committee, resulting in a more rapid convergence of employment and inflation to the FOMC’s objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner and to be more rapid than currently envisaged.  Conversely, if economic performance disappoints, increases in the federal funds rate are likely to take place later and to be more Let me now turn to our statement on “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.”  This statement is intended to provide information to the public about the eventual normalization process; it does not signal a change in the current or future stance of monetary policy.  As is always the case in setting policy, the FOMC will determine the timing and pace of policy normalization so as to promote its statutory mandate of maximum employment and price of 2017. gradual. stability. Since the crisis, the Federal Reserve has been providing extraordinary accommodation using nontraditional tools of monetary policy.  The FOMC’s intention has always been to return to a more traditional approach, and throughout this period, the Committee has been preparing for the normalization process.  In June 2011, the Committee set out some broad principles and some September 17, 2014  more specific tactics for how it envisioned the normalization process to take place.  In June 2013,   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  we noted that conditions had changed significantly in ways not anticipated in June of 2011, including the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet, and that some revision of those earlier plans was appropriate.  The document released today reflects our updated plans, which, readers of our minutes will know, have been under discussion for the last few FOMC meetings.  The new approach retains many broad objectives and principles from the original but also has some new elements.   As was the case before the crisis, the Committee intends to adjust the stance of monetary policy during normalization primarily through actions that influence the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates, not through active management of the balance sheet.  The federal funds rate will serve as the key rate to communicate the stance of policy.  To begin normalization, the Committee will raise its target range for the federal funds rate.  The Committee expects that the effective federal funds rate may vary within the target range, and could even move outside of that range on occasion, but such movements should have no material effect on financial conditions or the broader economy. The primary tool for moving the federal funds rate into the target range will be the rate of interest paid on excess reserves, or IOER.  The Committee expects that the federal funds rate will trade below the IOER rate while reserves are so plentiful, as is the case at present.  The Committee also intends to use an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, which, by transacting with a broad set of counterparties, will help ensure that the federal funds rate remains in the target range.  I would like to emphasize that the overnight RRP facility will only be used to the extent necessary and will be phased out when no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.  In addition, the Committee will adjust the particular settings of these tools as needed, September 17, 2014  and could deploy other supplementary tools as well, to ensure that we achieve our desired stance   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  of policy.   Turning now to our plans regarding the Fed’s balance sheet, the Committee intends to reduce securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner, primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of principal on securities held in the System Open Market Account.  Regarding the timing for ceasing reinvestments, the Committee now expects this to occur after the initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.  The Committee currently does not anticipate selling agency mortgage-backed securities as part of the normalization process, although limited sales might be warranted in the longer run to reduce or eliminate residual holdings.  The timing and pace of such sales would be communicated to the public in advance.  It’s the Committee’s intention that the Federal Reserve will, in the longer run, hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that these securities will primarily consist of Treasury securities. As I stated earlier, today’s release of the Committee’s updated normalization plans is in no way intended to signal a change in the stance of monetary policy.  Rather, it is meant simply to provide information about how the Committee envisions the normalization process in light of the changes in economic and financial circumstances that have occurred since we put forth our original plans more than three years ago.  That said, conditions could change further, and we will learn about our tools during normalization.  The Committee has agreed that it is prepared to make additional adjustments to its normalization plans if warranted by economic and financial developments.  Thank you.  Let me stop there.  I’ll be happy to take your questions. September 17, 2014     Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you.  Chair Yellen, there was some debate going into this meeting about the phrase “considerable time,” and whether it would remain in the statement.  I want to know if you could tell me just a couple things about it.  First, was it debated at the FOMC as to whether or not it should be included?  And, I’m sorry, we’ve been over this before, but what does it mean timewise?  And that’s just two questions.  I have just a couple more here.  Is the statement a form of forward guidance?  And, finally, how do you square this idea of a date when you and others on the FOMC have continuously said that you’re data dependent to the point where, if the data were to turn, would it not necessarily be a considerable time until you raise rates?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, of course, the Committee discussed its forward guidance today, and it discusses what the appropriate forward guidance is at every meeting.  This is part of our assessment of economic conditions and the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  In terms of what the term “considerable time” means, the Committee decided that, based on its assessment of economic conditions, that characterization remains appropriate, and it was comfortable with it.  I think if you look, for example, at the projections of individual participants that are revealed in the SEP—well, that’s the view of each participant, and, again, I’d emphasize, not a Committee collective view—there is relatively little change in the assessment of the outlook by participants between this meeting and the assessment in June.  So the outlook is little changed—a slight projection, but really quite minimal.  So, the outlook hasn’t changed that much from June, and the Committee felt comfortable with this characterization. Now, you said, “Isn’t this calendar-based guidance?”  I want to emphasize that there is no mechanical interpretation of what the term “considerable time” means.  And, as I’ve said September 17, 2014  repeatedly, the decisions that the Committee makes about what is the appropriate time to begin to   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  raise its target for the federal funds rate will be data dependent.  And in my opening comments just now, I again emphasized something I’ve said previously, which is that if the pace of progress in achieving our goals were to quicken, if it were to accelerate, it’s likely that the Committee would begin raising its target for the federal funds rate sooner than is now anticipated and might raise—might then raise the federal funds rate at a faster pace.  And the opposite is also true, if the projection were to change.  So there is no fixed mechanical interpretation of a time period.   I think it would not be accurate to describe the Committee’s guidance about the timing of the federal funds rate and when it will move above zero as being calendar based.  The Committee has started with a broad general statement of what determines how long it will keep the federal funds rate target at zero.  It has said that it will be looking at the actual and projected pace at which the gaps between our employment and inflation, and our goals for those variables, are closing.  And then what the Committee does at each meeting is—after saying that the assessment will take into account many different indicators and take into account inflation pressures and other things—it goes on to provide at that meeting its assessment of the implications of its view of the data at that time.  And that assessment really hasn’t changed over the last several meetings.  The Committee, based on its assessment at each meeting, has felt comfortable saying that, based on its assessment of those factors, it considers that it will be likely appropriate to maintain the current target range for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if inflation remains below the 2 percent objective.  So I wouldn’t describe that as—I know “considerable time” sounds like it’s a calendar concept, but it is highly conditional, and it’s linked to the Committee’s assessment of the economy. September 17, 2014     Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Thank you.  So if you would help us, I mean, square the circle a little bit—because having kept the guidance the same, having referred to significant underutilization of labor, having actually pushed GDP projections down a little bit, yet the rate path gets steeper and seems to be consolidating higher—so if it’s data dependent, what accounts for the faster projections on rate increases if the data aren’t moving in that direction? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, the growth projections for 2014 are down a little bit, but the unemployment path is also marginally lower.  So while the projected path of the labor market—unemployment and other measures of the labor market—of course is partly dependent on the growth outlook, it isn’t totally dependent on the growth outlook.  And the Committee assesses that the labor market is continuing to improve, and you see a small reduction in the path of the unemployment this year and then over the rest of the projection period.   So, if you ask me—you asked me, “Why has the projected funds rate path moved up?”  Well, you know, each participant knows the reason they wrote down what they did.  But, as a guess, I would hazard—first, I would say, there is relatively little upward movement in the path, and I would view it as broadly in line with what one would expect with a very small downward reduction in the path for unemployment and a very slight upward change in the projection for inflation.  So, most participants, in deciding on the path, I think, look at, as our guidance says, how large is the gap between performance of the labor market and that associated with our maximum employment objective, how large is the gap between inflation and our 2 percent objective, how fast will those gaps change.  And you see in the projections very modest reductions in the size of those gaps and modest—very small change of a slightly faster pace at which those gaps would change.  I would describe the change in the projections, both for the September 17, 2014  economy and the path of rates, as quite modest.  But the fact that they move does illustrate the   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  data-dependence principle that I think is really so important for market participants to keep in mind, that what we do will depend on how the data unfold.  There is uncertainty about that.  And as expectations and the actual performance of the economy change, you should expect to see movements in the dots. I think it’s also notable that the further you go out in the projection period, the wider the set of dots.  You see a big range out in 2017, and that reflects, in part, different forecasts by different members of the Committee about how rapid progress will be.  What you don’t see in the dot—so-called dot plot is also the uncertainty that each individual, each participant, sees around their own projection.  So things will depend on how the economy evolves.  That will change over time, and there’s a good deal of uncertainty associated with it. 

[SECTION]

CHRIS CONDON.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Madam Chair, the economy has been growing now for five years, and some economists believe the expansion will last another five years.  Why, in your view, is economic growth not creating more inflation in wages and in PCE?  Is this all about remaining slack in the labor market, or are there other forces at play? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, to my mind, the very slow pace of wage increases does reflect slack in the labor market.  We had a very deep recession, as is perhaps to be expected in the aftermath of a very significant financial crisis.  We’ve faced headwinds in the economy recovering, so the recovery has been slow.  Growth has been positive, and it’s lasted for five years.  But it’s nevertheless been slow relative to past recoveries that have not been associated with financial crises.  And while unemployment has come way down from the slightly over 10 percent level it reached, at 6.1 percent, it remains significantly above the level that most September 17, 2014  FOMC participants would regard as consistent with normal in the longer run, 5.2 to 5.5 percent.    Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  So there is significant underutilization of labor resources.  We continue to discuss whether or not the unemployment rate itself is an adequate measure of how much underutilization of labor resources there really is.  And, as I went into detail in Jackson Hole and won’t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels that have come down only very marginally of part-time employment for economic—or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor force participation as a result of cyclical factors.  And so, I think there still is—and the statement says it—“significant underutilization of labor resources” and a very modest pace of wage increases that’s picked up very little, I see as essentially a reflection of that. 

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Yellen, I want to come back to the interest rate projections that the Fed put out today.  The public, I think, would be enlightened by knowing a bit more about where you stand in relation to these projections.  And with that in mind, and in the name of transparency, I wonder if you could describe to us whether you’re at the low end of those projections, within the central tendency, or at the high end.  I also want to ask you about a San Francisco Fed paper that came out recently, which suggested that market expectations have been running below the Fed’s own projections.  So I wanted to ask you if you see that as well, and whether it’s at all troubling that market expectations might not be aligned with the central—with what the Fed put out today. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, with respect to identifying myself, the Committee has had discussions during the years that we have been providing these forecasts of the participants to the public as to whether or not it’s desirable from the standpoint of Committee functioning to identify who’s who in these pictures.  And thus far, while occasionally an individual will indicate September 17, 2014  in a speech what their personal views are, we have not yet decided that it would be a desirable   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  thing for the point of view of our decisionmaking process to identify individuals.  We have a subcommittee on communications that’s now chaired by Vice Chair Fischer, and they will be considering the SEP and whether or not some changes are appropriate.  But until and unless there is some change in the Committee stance on this, I don’t want to identify myself. You asked, second, about the San Francisco Fed paper that did point to a notable divergence between market views and the views of the Committee.  I’d say that there have been any number of different analyses of this topic, there are many different survey measures and interpretations of what the market thinks.  And I don’t frankly think it’s completely clear that there is a gap.  There are different views on whether or not such a gap exists.  To the extent that there is a gap, one reason for it could be that markets and participants have different views on the evolution of economic conditions.  For example, I think I’d note that when the Committee participants write down their forecast for the federal funds rate, they are showing the funds rate path that they consider most likely.  Their economic forecasts are of the conditions that they think are the most likely ones.  You don’t see the full range of possibilities there.  And the path for the funds rate is the path that each individual thinks is most likely.  Market participants, understanding that there are a range of possible outcomes, with upside and downside possibilities, are doing something slightly different, I think, when they’re determining market prices.  They are taking into account the possibility that there can be different economic outcomes, including—even if they’re not very likely—ones in which outcomes will be characterized by low inflation or low growth and the appropriate path of rates will be low. So, differences in probabilities of different outcomes can explain part of that.  We, you know, want to learn, we—market participants may have different views on the economy than the September 17, 2014  Committee does, and that’s something we want to try to infer and learn market views, in part   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  from information of this type.  What I can say is that it is important for market participants to understand what our likely response or reaction function is to the data, and our job is to try to communicate as clearly as we can the way in which our policy stance will depend on the data, and I promise to try to do that. 

[SECTION]

YLAN MUI.  Hi, Ylan Mui, Washington Post.  My question is about the new exit principles.  You guys say that you don’t plan to end reinvestments until after the first rate hike.  Can you give us a little bit of a sense of what are the conditions you’re going to be looking for when you eventually begin to end the reinvestments?  It sounds like tapering the reinvestments is also on the table.  What might go into your decision on whether or not to end them altogether, whether or not to taper them?  And do you have a general timeline for how long you think it will take to shrink the balance sheet once you actually start? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  All good questions.  So, I think the Committee would—will be focused on—we intend to use the path of short-term interest rates as our key tool of policy.  And, of course, market participants will be very focused, as we are, on what is the appropriate timing and pace of interest rate increases when that time comes.  And I think the Committee would like to feel that it has successfully begun the normalization process and that we’re successfully communicating with markets about how that process will be playing out over time.  And I think when the Committee is comfortable that that process is established, is working well, and we’re comfortable with the outlook, that they will begin the process of ceasing—or possibly tapering—but eventually ceasing reinvestments. So, we say that it will depend on economic and financial conditions, but we want to make sure normalization is successfully under way.  If we were only to shrink our balance sheet by September 17, 2014  ceasing reinvestments, it would probably take—to get back to levels of reserve balances that we   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  had before the crisis—I’m not sure we will go that low, but we’ve said that we will try to shrink our balance sheet to the lowest levels consistent with the efficient and effective implementation of policy—it could take to the end of the decade to achieve those levels. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  You said a few moments ago that there is perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor force participation as a result of cyclical factors.  This seems consistent with a recent paper by some members of your staff finding that labor force participation is unlikely to recover.  Is that now the “house” view that slack essentially consists of unemployment plus part-time workers who want full-time work, and that labor force participation is basically out of the equation? And the second question—in the statement of exit principles, you said that the Committee will act as soon as economic conditions warrant.  There had been an idea in circulation at some point that you might stay lower for longer as a means of compensating for some of the damage done during the recession.  Is this an indication that that debate has been settled, and that that idea is off the table? question—

CHAIR YELLEN.  I’m sorry.  Just remind me, what was the first question?  The first

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  The first question was—

CHAIR YELLEN.  Please.  

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  The first question was, has the labor force participation— 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Ah, labor force participation— 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  —been removed from the slack equation? September 17, 2014     Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So the recent Brookings paper by the Fed economists clearly indicates, and I said this at Jackson Hole, that there are structural reasons, particularly demographics but not only demographics, why labor force participation should be expected to that as well.  However, they did indicate that, in the paper, that they see some remaining cyclical shortfall.  By one technique that they used, they placed the estimate at ¼ percent, but by another technique that they used it could be, I believe they said, as large as 1 percent.  And so my own personal view is that there is some cyclical shortfall, and something certainly—probably within that range.  But nevertheless, it’s a meaningful cyclical shortfall.  It’s not completely—so I’m giving my own personal view, not a Committee assessment—that, you know, I see the flat—and given the underlying downward trend in labor force participation, we might interpret the flattening out of labor force participation over the last year as showing that that cyclical component has diminished somewhat.  I think there is something that remains, but eventually I would certainly agree with the authors, we should expect over time to see labor force participation declining.  And then, let’s see, the second piece was— 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Is the debate about lower-for-longer essentially over? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, you know, we stayed low for a very long time.  We have been at zero for a very long time and below the levels that some common policy rules would now be suggesting, given the level of unemployment and inflation.  So the recovery has been very slow.  We’ve also been doing unconventional policies, of course, buying assets.  And in a general sense, I think we have been lower for longer than—if you complete that sentence—than many standard policy rules would suggest.  So, in a sense, that is a policy that we have had.  And once we decide it’s appropriate to begin to normalize policy and to raise the level of our target for September 17, 2014  short-term interest rates, it would still take some time for rates to get back to levels—you can see   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  in our projection that by the end of 2017, the participants are, on average, projecting that rates will reach the levels they consider normal in the longer run.  And, similarly, we could make a similar statement with respect to where the funds rate would stand relative to the recommendations of rules.  So that would take some time to return to those kinds of levels. Madam Chair, there were two dissents from today’s decision.  I’d kind of like to get your thinking on how you treat dissents.  I think in Chairman Bernanke’s eight years, the largest number of dissents was three.  Do you see two dissents as a yellow-warning flashing light that policy may need to be moderated down the road?  How should market participants read the dissents? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think it’s very natural that the Committee should have a range of opinion about a decision as crucial as what is the right time to begin to normalize policy, and we do have a range of views in the Committee.  I don’t consider two dissents to be an abnormally large number.  Presidents Plosser and Fisher have been quite clear in all of their speeches recently in stating that they think the time has come to begin normalizing policy.  I think they, perhaps, have some concerns that if we don’t begin to do so soon that inflation will pick up above levels we—that they would consider desirable, or that they have some financial stability concerns.  But the Committee adopted today’s statement by an overwhelming majority, and I don’t consider the level of dissent to be surprising or very abnormal. 

[SECTION]

GREG IP.  Greg Ip of The Economist.  There’s been another downgrade in your near-term growth forecast and a downgrade in your unemployment rate path forecast.  Does it appear September 17, 2014  that potential is much lower than you thought, and therefore slack is closing more quickly than   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  you thought?  This seems to be a persistent pattern to your forecasts.  Secondarily, how concerned are you about events in Europe and especially the recent 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So there’s been a little bit of downgrading, I think, even this time in the longer-run normal growth rates that Committee participants have written down.  You are certainly right in saying that over a number of years now, there’s been a pattern of forecast errors in which either we’ve been on track with respect to unemployment or unemployment has come down in some cases faster than we anticipated, and yet growth has pretty persistently been surprising the Committee to the downside.  And that is a statement about productivity growth, which has been pretty disappointing.  So we have had downward revisions in the level of potential output and to some extent, at least for a time, in the projected pace of growth.  So that tension has been there.  There are a range of views about long-run growth.  A lot of people are writing about this topic.  I think the Committee’s longer-run estimates are neither at the most pessimistic end nor the most optimistic end. 

[SECTION]

GREG IP.  I had a question about Europe. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Oh, about Europe.  Well, I mean, you know, certainly we have discussed the outlook for Europe—the very low level of inflation that they have seen recently and the decline that they saw in inflationary expectations, in the slow pace of growth.  It is one of a number of risks to the global economy, and we certainly hope that they will be successful in seeing the pace of growth and inflation pick up, and I think that will be good for the global economy and the United States. September 17, 2014     Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL

ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times.  Madam Chair, I want to come back to the forward guidance.  Quite a large part of the Committee has recently criticized the guidance as being calendar based.  But if I understood your comments earlier, that’s not correct.  How should people understand it?  And if it doesn’t have a defined meaning, what purpose is it actually serving?  And do you expect to have to revisit it in the near future?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So we are constantly discussing forward guidance and thinking about whether it’s appropriate and how to revise it.  And we did do a major overhaul of our forward guidance in March.  I think the Committee participants who have spoken out on this topic recently want to make sure that we have the flexibility—that the Committee has the flexibility to respond to unfolding developments.  They want to make sure that if progress really does turn out to be faster than we have—we would expect, that the Committee will be in a position to start sooner tightening monetary policy.  They do not want to be locked into something that the dependence of our policy and make sure that we have appropriate flexibility.  But I agree with that.  And, as I said earlier, I think we do not have any mechanical interpretation that applies to this.  It, of course, gives an impression about what we think will be appropriate, but there is no mechanical interpretation.  And I’ve said repeatedly, and I want to say again, that if events surprise us, and we’re moving more quickly toward our objectives, and the Committee sees a need to move sooner or later depending on what the data is, that we do feel—I do feel we have the flexibility to move.  And it is important for markets to understand that there is uncertainty, and this statement is not some sort of firm promise about a particular amount of time. September 17, 2014     Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

STEVEN BECKNER.  Good afternoon, Chair Yellen.  Getting back to the one aspect of the forward guidance is the statement, which you’ve reiterated about the funds rate probably needing to stay below normal for some time after achieving mandate-consistent levels on unemployment, inflation, and so forth.  The SEP assessments of appropriate funds rate levels show the funds rate getting up to that 3.75 percent normal level at the end of 2017.  If you look at the SEP projections of unemployment, inflation, and so forth, they seem to get back to those mandate-consistent levels by the end of 2016, if not much sooner.  So what is the justification for waiting that much longer to get back to normal, particularly when you have such a large balance sheet that you intend to reduce only gradually?  Is there a danger of getting behind the curve? And, secondly, can I just ask, can you envision a time when, to reduce reserve pressures, you may have to resort to asset sales that you don’t anticipate doing now? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So on the first question of “some time” before rates return to normal levels, as I mentioned, you can see in the SEP that by the end of 2017, many participants are anticipating that rates will return to what they think are normal longer-run levels, but the economy, in their view, will have probably gotten back to normal levels of unemployment and near-normal levels of inflation sometime in 2016.  So that looks like a year or more in which rates would be below normal longer-run levels. We asked participants why they hold the views that they do about appropriate policy, and there are a number of different explanations that participants give.  But a common view on this is that there have been a variety of headwinds resulting from the crisis that have slowed growth, led to a sluggish recovery from the crisis, and that these headwinds will dissipate only slowly, that they are dissipating—an example would be the fact that mortgage credit really is, at this point, available really to those with pristine credit.  Credit conditions there are abnormally tight.  September 17, 2014  Another thing that we see is that households’ expectations about their likely income paths remain   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  quite depressed relative to pre-crisis levels.  That’s something that may be holding back consumer spending.  So the view would be that those forces will dissipate over time, but only very gradually.  In addition, we have had slow productivity growth, and a slow pace of potential output likely depresses the pace of investment spending.  And so, those are some of the things that participants mention as why it will take some time to get back. So the story is, it’s not that the Fed is behind the curve in failing to return the funds rate to normal levels when the economy is recovered.  It is rather that, in order to achieve such a recovery in 2016 or by the end, that it’s necessary and appropriate to have a somewhat more accommodative policy than would be normal in the absence of those headwinds. 

[SECTION]

PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes of Fox Business, ma’am.  I would like to follow up on Greg’s question about Europe, because tomorrow Scotland is going to be voting on independence from Great Britain, and there’s some concern that if it does vote to break from Great Britain, that this could cause some turmoil in global financial markets and the global economy.  Are you concerned about that?  Do you see any impact if Scotland does vote for independence on the European economy and potentially on the American economy?  And, if so, is the Fed doing anything in preparation for that possibility?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, Scottish voters are about to go to the polls tomorrow, and they’ve had a good debate about this topic.  And in light of that, I really don’t want to weigh in on this today. 

[SECTION]

PEDRO DA COSTA.  Thank you.  Pedro da Costa with Dow Jones Newswires.  My question is about your particular views about whether a gradual approach to tightening is better than a more aggressive and less predictable one, because there was some discussion about—September 17, 2014  internally and externally, about whether it was the Fed’s predictability in the 2004-ish period that   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  kind of created the conditions of complacency that led to the housing bubble.  So I wonder if you’d be more inclined to be gradualist in your approach and more transparent in outlining future moves or whether you think keeping the market guessing—there’s some value to that.  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  You know, this is something the Committee is going to have to discuss when the time comes to normalize policy.  Looking back on the period, the run-up to the financial crisis, I don’t think, by any means, “measured pace” and the very predictable pace of 25 basis points per meeting explains why we had a financial crisis, but it may have diminished volatility and been a small contributing factor, and the Committee will have to think about how to do this.  I think many people in the aftermath of that episode think that somewhat less of a mechanical pace would perhaps be better, but this is a matter that we will, in due time, have to discuss. ",Janet Yellen,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
15,2014-12-17,"CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  The Federal Open Market Committee concluded its last meeting of the year earlier today.  As indicated in our policy statement, the FOMC “reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.”  The Committee also updated its forward guidance for the federal funds rate, indicating that “the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.”  This new language does not represent a change in our policy intentions and is fully consistent with our previous guidance, which stated that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the end of our asset purchase program.  But with that program having ended in October, and the economy continuing to make progress toward our objectives, the Committee judged that some modification to our guidance is appropriate at this time.  I will have more to say about our policy In the labor market, progress continues toward the FOMC’s objective of maximum employment.  The pace of job growth has been strong recently, with job gains averaging nearly 280,000 per month over the past 3 months; over the past 12 months, job gains averaged nearly 230,000 per month.  The unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in November, three-tenths lower than the latest reading available at the time of the September FOMC meeting.  Broader measures of labor market utilization have shown similar improvement, and the labor force participation rate has leveled out.  As noted in the FOMC statement, “underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish.”  Even so, there is room for further improvement, with too many people who want jobs being unable to find them, too many who are working part time but would prefer   December 17, 2014  full-time work, and too many who have given up searching for a job but would likely do so if the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL labor market were stronger. The Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the economy to support ongoing improvement in the labor market.  Real GDP looks to have increased robustly in the third quarter, reflecting solid consumption and investment spending.  Smoothing through the quarterly ups and downs earlier this year, real GDP expanded around 2½ percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter, and the available indicators suggest that economic growth is running at roughly that pace in the current quarter.  The Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of growth going forward. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, and the recent sizable declines in oil prices will likely hold down overall inflation in the near term.  But as the effects of these oil price declines and other transitory factors dissipate and as resource utilization continues to rise, the Committee expects inflation to move gradually back toward its objective.  In making this forecast, the Committee is mindful of the recent declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation.  At this point, the Committee views these movements as likely to prove transitory, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.  That said, developments in this area obviously bear close watching. This outlook is reflected in the individual economic projections submitted in conjunction with this meeting by the FOMC participants.  As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.  The central tendency of the unemployment rate projections is slightly lower than in the September projections and now stands at 5.2 to 5.3 percent at the end of next year, in line with its estimated longer-run normal level.  Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining a little further over December 17, 2014  the course of 2016 and 2017.  The central tendency of the projections for real GDP growth is Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 2.3 to 2.4 percent for 2014, up a bit from the September projections.  Over the next three years, the projections for real GDP growth run somewhat above the estimates of longer-run normal growth.  Finally, although FOMC participants project inflation in the near term to be lower on account of the decline in energy prices, they continue to see inflation moving gradually back toward 2 percent.  The central tendency of the inflation projections is 1.0 to 1.6 percent next year, rising to 1.8 to 2.0 percent in 2017. As I noted earlier, the Committee “reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.”  Regarding forward guidance for the federal funds rate, our October statement indicated that it likely would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of our asset purchase program, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.  Today’s statement, which indicates that “the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy,” does not signify any change in the Committee’s policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.  As before, this judgment is based on the Committee’s assessment of realized and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation—an assessment that is based on a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. Given that the Committee is not signaling a change in policy, why did we update our guidance?  The reason is that, with the asset purchase program having been wound down in rate increase with reference to an event that is receding into the past.  Instead, we have shifted to December 17, 2014  language that better reflects the Committee’s focus on the economic conditions that would make Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL liftoff appropriate.  Employment is rising at a healthy rate and the U.S. economy is strengthening, reflecting, in part, a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Of course, inflation has been running somewhat below our goal of 2 percent, but we project that gap to close gradually over time.  As progress in achieving maximum employment and 2 percent inflation continues, at some point it will become appropriate to begin reducing policy accommodation.  But, based on its current outlook, the Committee judges that it can be patient in doing so.  In particular, the Committee considers it unlikely to begin the normalization process for at least the next couple of meetings. This assessment, of course, is completely data dependent.  If incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated.  Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated. Once we begin to remove policy accommodation, it continues to be the Committee’s assessment that, “even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”  This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy given by FOMC participants.  Assuming that the economy evolves broadly in line with participants’ expectations, almost all participants believe that it will be appropriate to begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate in 2015. There are a range of views on the appropriate timing of liftoff within the year, in part reflecting differences in participants’ expectations for how the economy will evolve.  By the time December 17, 2014  of liftoff, participants expect to see some further decline in the unemployment rate and additional Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL improvement in labor market conditions.  They also expect core inflation to be running near current levels but foresee being reasonably confident in their expectation that inflation will move back toward our 2 percent longer-run inflation objective over time.  Of course, as I previously emphasized, the timing of the initial rise in the federal funds rate target, as well as the path for the target thereafter, are contingent on economic conditions. By late 2016, the median projection for the federal funds rate, at 2.5 percent, remains more than 1 percentage point below the longer-run value of 3¾ percent or so projected by most participants, even though the central tendency of the unemployment rate by that time is slightly below its estimated longer-run value and the central tendency for inflation is close to our 2 percent objective.  FOMC participants provide a number of explanations for the federal funds rate running below its normal longer-run level at that time—in particular, the residual effects of the financial crisis, which are likely to continue to constrain household spending and constrain credit availability for some time.  But as these factors dissipate further, most participants expect the federal funds rate to move close to its longer-run normal level by the end of 2017. Finally, the Committee will continue its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from holdings of agency debt and MBS.  The Committee’s sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and promote further progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions.  

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Yellen, a number of Fed officials have projected in the lead-up to this meeting that the most likely timing December 17, 2014  for liftoff was around the middle of next year.  I wonder if you could clarify that.  You said in Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL your statement that “patient” means not for at least two meetings.  Your forecast that—the FOMC’s forecasts seem to be consistent with something like a middle-of-the-year liftoff.  Can you speak to that?  And can you also speak to the downdraft we’re seeing in inflation now and, in particular, the market-based inflation expectations and whether that gives the Committee any hesitance about proceeding towards liftoff in the months ahead? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I did say that the statement that the Committee can be patient should be interpreted as meaning that it is unlikely to begin the normalization process for at least the next couple of meetings.  Now, that doesn’t point to any preset or predetermined time at which normalization is—will begin.  There are a range of views on the Committee, and it will be dependent on how incoming data bear on the progress the economy is making.   First of all, I want to emphasize that no meeting is completely off the table, in the sense that if we do see faster progress toward our objectives than we currently expect, then it is possible that the process of normalization would occur sooner than we now anticipate.  And, of course, the converse is also true.  So, at this point, we think it unlikely that it will be appropriate—that we will see conditions for at least the next couple of meetings that will make it appropriate—for us to decide to begin normalization.  A number of Committee participants have indicated that, in their view, conditions could be appropriate by the middle of next year, but there is no preset time.  And there are a range of views as to when the appropriate conditions will likely fall in place.  So that’s something we will be watching closely as the year unfolds. You asked also, I think, about inflation.  And, as I mentioned in my press statement, especially with the downward pressures on inflation that we expect to see for a little while because of declining oil prices and falling import prices, we certainly expect headline inflation to December 17, 2014  be under downward pressure for a while.  And, as I mentioned, most participants do envision that Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL conditions will be appropriate sometime during this coming year to begin normalizing policy.  And they do largely expect that inflation will be—core inflation will probably be running close to its current level.  And headline inflation could even be lower.  But what they will want to have is a feeling of reasonable confidence that when we start the process of normalizing policy, that it will be moving up over time.  And, of course, as labor market conditions continue to improve, history suggests that as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, that that’s likely to occur. what’s happening now with the transition with the Fed, there seems to be a pattern developing that the market expects big news to come when you have a press conference and no news to come when you don’t have one.  But is that a good expectation?  And is there any thought to starting to have a press conference at every meeting? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I would really like to discourage that expectation.  Every meeting that we have is a live meeting at which the Committee could make a policy decision.  And we will feel free to do so.  So I would really like to strongly discourage the expectation that policy moves can only occur when there’s a scheduled press conference.  And we have long had in place the ability to hold a press conference call, rather than an in-person press conference.  And we did do so on a number of occasions in earlier years.  So the Committee, clearly, would want to be able to explain its reasoning.  As we begin the process of normalizing policy, every meeting is live.  And if we were to decide at a meeting to begin to normalize policy, I expect we would hold a press conference call. December 17, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Was there concern—Steve Liesman, CNBC—was there concern expressed at the meeting that the signal coming from markets—and a variety of markets—lower oil prices, lower yields around the world, was one of deflation, and that that risk was one that should, perhaps, overshadow the concern about inflation on the other side? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, thanks Steve.  We’re very attentive to global developments and certainly discuss them in the meeting.  The very substantial decline we have seen in oil prices is one of the most important developments shaping the global outlook.  It will have different effects in different regions and could well have effects on financial markets, as we are seeing.  I think the judgment of the Committee is that, from the standpoint of the United States and the U.S. outlook, that the decline we have seen in oil prices is likely to be, on net, a positive.  It’s something that’s certainly good for families, for households.  It’s putting more money in their pockets.  Having to spend less on gas and energy, and so, in that sense, it’s like a tax cut that boosts their spending power.  The United States remains—although our production of oil has increased dramatically, we still remain a net importer of oil.  Of course there may be some offset in the form of reduced drilling activity, and possibly some change, some reduction in cap-ex plans in the drilling area.  But, on balance, I would see these developments as a positive for the standpoint of the U.S. economy. With respect to deflation, we see downward pressure on headline inflation from declining energy prices.  We certainly recognize that that is going to be pushing down headline inflation and may even spill over, to some extent, to core inflation.  But, at this point, although we indicated we’re monitoring inflation developments carefully, we see these developments as transitory.  And the Committee continues to believe—especially with the improvement we’re seeing in the labor market, which we expect to continue—that inflation will move back up to our December 17, 2014  2 percent objective over time.  As I indicated, we will want to feel, I believe, that people will Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL expect to feel reasonably confident about that when they—when the process of normalization begins.  But we do expect them to be transitory. 

[SECTION]

ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times.  Madame Chair, there’s a big gap between the pace markets expect you to raise interest rates and the rate you’ve indicated in your “dot plot.”  Are markets misunderstanding your intentions?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So that’s difficult for me to say.  What I want to say is that our objective is to communicate as clearly as we possibly can about our plans and how we see the economic environment unfolding.  When the participants in the Committee fill out their projections, they’re asked to give the path of the federal funds rate and of the various economic variables that they consider most likely.  They’re not asked to talk about all the different things that could happen, recognizing there is uncertainty, and the paths of the funds rate that they would consider appropriate if those other alternatives were to happen.  But other alternatives, I think, are priced into the market.  And one reason that the market prices may be different than the Committee’s is because they place probability on other outcomes that look different than what they regard as the modal forecast.  They may also have a different set of expectations about how the—about the economic outlook and how it’s likely to unfold.  So I recognize that there are significant differences.  I can’t tell you exactly what they’re due to.  But what I do want to do is communicate as clearly as I can, on behalf of the Committee, how we think the economy’s likely to progress and how we would likely set the federal funds rate over time if that forecast bears out. 

[SECTION]

ROBIN HARDING.  It doesn’t make you uncomfortable, where markets are now? December 17, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  There are a number of different factors that are bearing on the path of when oil prices move down and the dollar appreciates, that that tends to put downward pressure on inflation compensation and on longer-term rates.  We also have safe-haven flows that may be affecting longer-term Treasury yields.  So I can’t tell you exactly what is driving market developments.  But what I can say is that we are trying to communicate our thoughts as clearly as we can. 

[SECTION]

STEVEN MUFSON.  Hi.  Steve Mufson from the Washington Post.  I was just hoping you could go into a little more detail about the oil effect.  Even though you see it as transitory, does that give you a little more room to keep rates low in the next few months?  And if—alternately, if prices bounce back, what’s that going to do to your ability to change rates, and how might you react to that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well I—I’d say, you know, that I think what we have seen since the mid-’80s is that, in an environment where inflation expectations are well anchored, that movements in oil and commodity prices and import prices tend to have transitory effects on the inflation outlook.  There were many years in which we had unanticipated increases in oil prices,   really beginning in 2004 and 2005, that put upward pressure on headline inflation and sometimes even spilled through into core, and, typically, the Committee looked through those impacts on inflation with the view that they would be transitory.  And I think experience bears out that they were transitory.  And I think that’s the Committee’s expectation here.  Inflation, even core inflation, has been running below our inflation objective.  Movements in oil, you know, now down and perhaps later up, will move inflation around, certainly headline inflation.  But the Committee, at this point, anticipates those impacts to be transitory.  So as long as participants December 17, 2014  feel reasonably confident that the inflation projection is one where we expect to meet our Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 2 percent objective over time, that’s what I think how they’ll be looking at things as we decide on the path for the funds rate. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, New York Times.  Does “a couple” mean two?  And when you talk about reasonable confidence in inflation expectations, can you elaborate a little bit about what it would take to give you reasonable confidence that inflation is headed back to 2 percent? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So “a couple”—I believe the dictionary probably says, “a couple” means two.  So, “a couple” means two.  And with respect to inflation—our forecast for inflation and inflation expectations, let me start by saying I think it’s important that monetary policy be forward looking.  The lags in monetary policy are long, and, therefore, the Committee has to base its decisions on how to set the federal funds rate looking into the future.  Theory is important, and theories that are consistent with historical evidence will be something that governs the thinking of many people around the table.  Typically, we have seen that as long as inflation expectations are well anchored, that as the labor market recovers, we’ll gradually see upward pressure on both wages and prices, and that inflation will tend to move back toward 2 percent.  I think historically we have seen, as the economy strengthens and slack diminishes, that inflation does tend to gradually rise over time.  And as long—you know, I—just speaking for myself, I will be looking for evidence that I think strengthens my confidence in that view and, you know, looking at the full range of data that bear on whether or not that’s a reasonable view of how events will unfold.  But it’s likely to be a decision that’s based on forecasts and confidence in the forecast. December 17, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL FLAHERTY.  Michael Flaherty, Reuters News.  Chair Yellen, a lot of attention has been focused on liftoff.  But, I wonder, has the Committee discussed what happens after that liftoff and what, you know, the rate path would be after you make the first move? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, I think you raise a very important point because, although there is a great deal of market focus on the timing of liftoff, what to matter in thinking about the stance of policy is what the entire path of interest rates will look like.  And I really don’t have much for you other than to say that they will be data dependent—that, over time, the stance of policy will be adjusted to try to keep the economy on a track where we see continuing progress toward achieving our goals of maximum employment and price stability.  There’s—you know, the federal funds rate has been sitting in the 0 to ¼ percent range now for six years.  This is—and we have a very large balance sheet.  We are providing a very highly accommodative monetary policy.  And even as we begin to normalize the stance of monetary policy, when that becomes appropriate, it’s important to remember that monetary policy will still be very accommodative for a long time.  And as we begin to normalize policy, we will be looking at unfolding economic developments.  And as the economy strengthens, and we come closer to achieving our objectives, I think it’s very likely that we will, you know, progress on the path of normalizing policy.  But I can’t tell you, specifically, other than saying it will depend on progress, and moves will be data dependent.  I can’t say much more than that.

GREG IP.  Chair Yellen, the Committee’s projections show unemployment running below your own views on where full employment should be for the next several years.  Does that reflect a desire on the part of the Committee that the economy run somewhat above potential for a while?  And, if so, can you elaborate on why it wants that and what purpose it achieves?  And, related to the question that Jon Hilsenrath asked earlier, you’ve called the decline in inflation—December 17, 2014  and market-based measures of inflation expectations—transitory.  But this decline has been very Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL pronounced in the five-year-forward range.  So we’re talking about expectations that inflation many years from now will be below target.  And some market participants see that as evidence of transitory? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So you—your first question is:  Why is it that the Committee sees unemployment as declining slightly below its estimate of the longer-run natural rate?  And, I think, in part, the reason for that is that inflation is running below our objective, and the Committee wants to see inflation move back toward our objective over time.  And a short period of a very slight undershoot of unemployment below the natural rate will facilitate a slightly faster return of inflation to our objective.  It is, I should say, a very small undershoot in a situation where there is great uncertainty about exactly what constitutes maximum employment or a longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  We also do see the different measures of slack in the labor market point to different assessments of just what maximum employment is.  The standard unemployment rate, for quite some time now, has been signaling a little bit less slack in the labor number of people who were part-time employed but would prefer full-time jobs.  And the portion of the decline we’ve seen in labor force participation, that looks like it would disappear in a—or be eroded in a stronger economy.  And so it may be that with a very small undershoot of this longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate, as measured by the standard unemployment rate, we’ll be seeing some further progress on those other margins of slack.  But it’s important to point out that the Committee is not anticipating an overshoot of its 2 percent inflation objective. December 17, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Oh, and longer-dated expectations.  Well, what I would say, we refer to this in the statement as “inflation compensation” rather than “inflation expectations.”  The gap between the nominal yields on 10-year Treasuries, for example, and TIPS have declined—that’s inflation compensation.  And five-year, five-year-forwards, as you’ve said, have also declined.  That could reflect a change in inflation expectations, but it could also reflect changes in assessment of inflation risks.  The risk premium that’s necessary to compensate for inflation, that might especially have fallen if the probabilities attached to very high inflation have come down.  And it can also reflect liquidity effects in markets.  And, for example, it’s sometimes the case that—when there is a flight to safety, that flight tends to be concentrated in nominal Treasuries and could also serve to compress that spread.  So I think the jury is out about exactly how to interpret that downward move in inflation compensation.  And we indicated that we are monitoring inflation developments carefully.

PETER COOK.  Madame Chair, Peter Cook of Bloomberg Television.  I want to follow up, if I could, on firming going forward, on the normalization once liftoff takes place.  I know you said this is going to be data dependent.  Does that suggest to markets, to those watching, that the measured pace we’ve seen in a previous tightening cycle, those quarter-point increments, that that’s not something markets should expect?  And what’s your own takeaway from how effective that measured pace was back in that previous tightening cycle?   And if I could follow up just separately on the dissents at this meeting.  There were three dissents, a notable number, certainly.  What does that suggest about the debate around the table and your ability to forge consensus going forward?  Are you disappointed with the number of dissents? December 17, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me start with the number of dissents.  There is a wide range of opinion in the Committee.  I think it’s appropriate for people to be able to express their views.  And, in a sense, you see dissents on both sides.  I think the statement does a good job of reflecting what the majority of the Committee thinks is appropriate policy.  So at—you know, at a time like this, where we are making consequential decisions, I think it’s very reasonable to see divergences of opinion.  And just remind me, what was the other—about the— 

[SECTION]

PETER COOK.  Measured pace. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  —measured pace.  There certainly has been no, you know, decision on the part of the Committee to move at a measured pace or to use language like that.  I think quite a few people, looking back on the use of that language in the—I can’t remember if it was 12 or 16 meetings, where there were 25 basis point moves.  We’d probably not like to repeat a sequence in which there was a measured pace and 25 basis point moves at every meeting.  So I certainly don’t want to encourage you to think that there will be a repeat of that.  Many members of the Committee, participants, have said that they think policy should be based on the actual evolution of economic activity and inflation, which tends to be variable over time, and that’s why I say I anticipate it will be data dependent.  We have continued to provide guidance, the same guidance that we have for some time, that says the Committee “anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”   I know that’s a mouthful, but it says, in effect, that the Committee believes that the economic conditions that have made recovery difficult, we’re getting beyond them.  They are optimistic that those conditions will lift.  They see the longer-run normal level of interest rates as December 17, 2014  around 3¾ percent.  So there’s no view in the Committee that there is secular stagnation in the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL sense that we won’t eventually get back to pretty historically normal levels of interest rates.  But they have said, it’ll, you know, the economy has required to get where it is a good deal of monetary policy accommodation; we expect to be able to normalize policy.  But, until those conditions have lifted that have held back economic activity, monetary policy will need to stay accommodative.  So, in that sense, perhaps that’s equivalent to saying that the path of normalization is anticipated to be relatively gradual.  But, again, the path of rates will depend on how economic conditions actually evolve, and that’s nothing more than an expectation on the part of the Committee.

PEDRO DA COSTA.  Pedro da Costa with Dow Jones Newswires.  Enough about rates.  I want to ask you about the New York Fed.  The New York Fed’s been in the news a lot lately.  President Dudley was invited to Congress to testify about conflicts of interest there.  You had things like the Segarra tapes, the Beim report, and, most recently, the revelation that a former New York Fed official was exchanging information with someone at Goldman Sachs who was also—had New York Fed connections.  I just wonder—and also there were scandals during the crisis related to Stephen Friedman regarding the New York Fed, and his purchase of Goldman Sachs stock.  Do you see the New York Fed as a black mark on the Fed system because of these recurring scandals?  Have you talked to Bill Dudley about reforming the image of that particular regional Fed?  And do you think a person that has—that spent 21 years of his career at Goldman Sachs is in a position to regain public credibility about conflicts of interest? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, let me say that I think it’s very important for the Federal Reserve System to have confidence in the quality of its supervision.  And I do have a good deal of confidence in the quality of our supervision program, for the banking organizations we December 17, 2014  supervise in general, and that also applies to the largest banking organizations.  We rely on Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL examiners who are in the field and at the Reserve Banks to be providing information about what’s happening in those organizations.  But that information feeds into a process in which it is not individuals at any single Reserve Bank.  But, at the Board, it’s a Board-led process, and it involves senior officials at a number of different Reserve Banks.  It’s also a multidisciplinary process that involves not only people from supervision, but those from markets, from economic research.  Experts who focus on financial stability all come together to evaluate the information that they have and to assign supervisory ratings and decide on the appropriate program for all of those large institutions.  We’ve strengthened the process of supervision enormously since the crisis, and I feel a very good sense of confidence in how we’re carrying that out. Now, it is important to make sure that we have fed into this process all the information that’s relevant to making the right decisions.  And when there are individuals who are examiners, who may disagree with others in their team about how to interpret what’s going on at a particular institution, it’s important that there be channels by which they can make sure that disagreements are fed up to the highest levels.  This is true throughout the work we do.  We do economic forecasting, and our—the FOMC receives information to help us make decisions, but obviously there are disagreements about—among economists about how to interpret developments.  It’s also important for us there to make sure we understand alternative views.  So this is important in supervision.  We’ve announced that the Board has undertaken a review of whether or not there are appropriate mechanisms in place in all of the Reserve Banks that individuals who disagree with decisions can make their own views known and feed into the process, and we’ve also asked our inspector general to look into that. December 17, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL

JEFF KEARNS.  Thank you.  Jeff Kearns from Bloomberg News.  I’d also like to get off monetary policy and ask you about the Federal Reserve’s relationship with Congress.  Specifically, how worried are you about legislation that has been proposed, and may be proposed again in the next Congress, that would reduce Fed independence?  Would you see yourself trying to fight back?  Or would you see yourself trying to go to Congress to work with them to do more with transparency or something else to reduce their concerns without making them law?  And, if there were bills sent to the White House, would you talk to the President about vetoing them?  Or do you have any confidence that he would veto bills that would reduce the Fed’s independence?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me simply say that Congress has assigned us important tasks in monetary policy and in other roles that we perform, and the Federal Reserve is highly focused on attempting to carry out the mandates that Congress has given us in the area of monetary policy.  It’s our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, and that’s what we’re working on.  You know, I would say that the ability of a central bank to make the decisions about monetary policy that it regards as in the best longer-run interests of the economy, free of short-run political interference, is very important to the effective conduct of monetary policy.  And I think that history shows, not only in the United States but around the world, that central bank independence promotes better economic performance.  So I do think central bank independence is very important, and that it’s important to make sure that we can make the decisions we think are best, free of short-run political interference with respect to monetary policy. We should be accountable, and we are accountable to Congress in explaining what we do.  I believe strongly in transparency, and I believe strongly that we should communicate as clearly December 17, 2014  what we are doing and the rationale for doing it, and I am very open to looking for ways Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL ourselves to improve our communications and transparency, and working with Congress to do that.  But I would be very concerned about actions.  Back in 1978, Congress explicitly passed legislation to ensure that there would be no GAO audits of monetary policy decisionmaking— namely, policy audits.  I certainly hope that will continue, and I will try to forcefully make the case for why that’s important.

JEFF KEARNS.  Would it veto?

CHAIR YELLEN.  I cannot speak for the White House.  I wouldn’t attempt to do that.

PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes of Fox Business, ma’am.  And also, I’ll stay off of interest rates.  And first, I want to wish you happy holidays. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

PETER BARNES.  And, second, I want to ask you about the Russian economy.  Did that come up in the meeting in your discussion about the global economic developments?  As you know, there’s a lot of concern that with the drop in oil prices, the Russian economy could be in some trouble.  Russia owes a lot of money to U.S. and foreign banks and Russian companies.  Is there any concern about default?  Any concern about possible contagion?  And, if so, has the Fed taken any steps to prepare for that?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we certainly did review global economic developments, including developments in the Russian economy.  Clearly, Russia has been hit very hard by the series of very difficult economic conditions in the Russian economy. Of course we discussed what the potential spillovers are to the United States, which could occur both through trade and financial linkages.  But these linkages are actually relatively small.  December 17, 2014  Russia accounts for less than 1 percent of U.S. trade volume, and U.S. banks’ exposure to Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL Russian residents is really quite small in terms of—relative to their capital.  In terms of the portfolios of U.S. residents, there are Russian securities, but they are—they account for a very small share.  So I expect that the linkages back to the spillovers to the United States, both through trade and financial channels, would be small.  Europe, of course, is somewhat more exposed to Russia, both because Russia is an important supplier of oil and natural gas to Europe and the financial linkages are somewhat greater.  But, in the case of the United States, I see the spillovers relative—it is pretty small.  But we’re obviously watching that closely. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Also, happy holidays. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Same to you. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  There’s a contagion risk to the—from low oil prices that people are talking about in the markets.  What does it mean to the banks that have lent, you know, into the oil patch with the low oil prices?  And I guess, you know, your warnings about leveraged loans—you have made warnings over the past year about leveraged lending.  Are you worried that they haven’t been heeded?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, I mean, there is some—you’re talking about in the United States exposure?  I mean, we have seen some impacts of lower oil prices on the spreads for high-yield bonds, where there’s exposure to oil companies that may see distress or a decline in their earnings, and we have seen some increase in spreads on high-yield bonds more generally.  I think for the banking system, as a whole, the exposure to oil—I’m not aware of significant issues there.  This is the kind of thing that is part of risk management for banking organizations and the kind of thing they look at in stress tests.  But the movements in oil prices have been very large and undoubtedly unexpected.  December 17, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL We—in terms of leverage, and whether or not levered entities could be badly affected by movements in oil prices, leverage in the financial system, in general, is way down from the levels before the crisis.  So it’s not a major concern that there are levered entities that would be badly affected by this, but we’ll have to watch carefully.  There have been large and unexpected movements in oil prices. 

[SECTION]

STEVE BECKNER.  Good afternoon, Chair Yellen.  Steve Beckner of MNI.  I will go back to interest rates, if you don’t mind.  Actually, it’s a question about balance sheet effects on the overall appropriate level of monetary policy.  In reaffirming the reinvestment policy, the FOMC says, once again, that this will help maintain accommodative financial conditions.  In the past, it’s said that the large portfolio of securities will exert a downward effect on long-term interest rates.  As you look forward to raising short-term rates, to what extent does the FOMC need to take into account this sort of residual, accommodative effect of maintaining a large balance sheet? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I agree, and that’s why we stated that we typically think of the monetary policy impact of our asset purchases as depending on the stock of assets that we hold on our balance sheet rather than the flow of purchases, and so we’re reminding the public that we continue to hold a large stock of assets, and that is tending to push down term premiums in longer-term yields.  We made clear when we—or tried to make clear—when we issued our normalization principles in September that we intend to use changes in our target for the federal funds rate as the main tool that we will actively use to adjust financial conditions.  Rather than actively planning to sell the assets that we’ve put onto our balance sheet, sometime after we begin raising our targets for short-term interest rates, depending on economic and financial conditions, we’re likely to reduce or cease reinvestment and gradually run down the stock of our December 17, 2014  assets.  But our active tool for adjusting monetary—the stance of monetary policy so that it is Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL appropriate for the economic needs for the country, that will be done through adjusting our short-term target range for the federal funds rate.

KEVIN HALL.  Kevin Hall with McClatchy Newspapers.  I can’t believe nobody’s asked you the most important question, about what’s going on with your San Francisco 49ers, since everybody’s already wished you a happy holiday.  Can you talk a little bit about housing?  Few things are more important to Americans in their wealth creation than housing.  You’ve, in your statement, noted that it continues to be a drag.  Mr. Dudley has—was actually relatively upbeat in his forecast.  I don’t know if that’s a view shared on the Committee.  What do you think is holding housing back?  What can Congress do?  What will you tell Congress in the coming year?  And more—and a clarification on the Dudley question from earlier.  You didn’t mention him by name in your being pleased by quality of supervision.  Are you pleased with Mr. Dudley’s handling of the events? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me start with that.  I have great confidence in President Dudley.  He’s done a fine job in running the New York Fed, and I want to be very clear that I have great confidence in him.  He’s a distinguished public servant, and he has worked very hard in the aftermath of the crisis to make sure that the New York Fed is doing all that it needs to do to contribute to the work that we do both in financial stability and in supervision.  And let’s see, the other question that you asked was about— 

[SECTION]

KEVIN HALL.  Housing. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  —about housing.  So, you know, I’ve been surprised that housing hasn’t recovered more robustly than it has.  In part, I think it reflects very tight credit—continuing tight credit conditions for any borrower that doesn’t have really pristine credit, you December 17, 2014  know, credit ratings, and my hope is that that situation will ease over time.  In addition, Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL household formation has been very depressed, and my expectation is that, as the labor market continues to improve and households feel better about their financial condition, that we will see household formation pick up and a somewhat stronger recovery than we’ve seen thus far in housing. ",Janet Yellen,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
16,2017-03-15,"CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  Today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to ¾ to 1 percent.  Our decision to make another gradual reduction in the amount of policy accommodation reflects the economy’s continued progress toward the employment and price stability objectives assigned to us by law.  For some time the Committee has judged that, if economic conditions evolved as anticipated, gradual increases in the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate to achieve and maintain our objectives.  Today’s decision is in line with that view and does not represent a reassessment of the economic outlook or of the appropriate course for monetary policy.  I’ll have more to say about monetary policy shortly, but first I’ll review recent economic developments and the outlook. The economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Solid income gains and relatively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth have supported household spending growth.  Business investment, which was soft for much of last year, has firmed somewhat, and business sentiment is at favorable levels.  Overall, we continue to expect that the economy will expand at a moderate pace over the next few years. Job gains averaged about 200,000 per month over the past three months, maintaining the solid pace we have seen over the past year.  The unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in February, near its recent low.  Broader measures of labor market underutilization also remain low.  Participation in the labor force has been little changed, on net, for about three years.  Given the underlying downward trend in participation stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population, a relatively steady participation rate is a further sign of improving conditions in the labor market.  Looking ahead, we expect that job conditions will strengthen somewhat further.  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL Turning to inflation, the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose to nearly 2 percent in January, up from less than 1 percent last summer.  That rise was largely driven by energy prices, which have been increasing recently after earlier indicator of future inflation—has been little changed in recent months at about 1¾ percent.  We expect core inflation to move up and overall inflation to stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years, in line with our longer-run objective. Let me now turn to the economic projections that were submitted for this meeting by Committee participants.  As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depend on each participant’s assessment of the many factors that shape the outlook.  The median projection for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product is 2.1 percent this year and next, and edges down to 1.9 percent in 2019, slightly above its estimated longer-run rate.  The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and remains at that level over the next two years, modestly below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate.  Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.9 percent this year and rises to 2 percent in 2018 and 2019.  These economic projections are very little changed from those made in December. Returning to monetary policy, the Committee judged that a modest increase in the federal funds rate is appropriate in light of the economy’s solid progress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability.  Even after this increase, monetary policy remains accommodative, thus supporting some further strengthening in the job market and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.  Today’s decision also reflects our view that waiting too long to scale back some accommodation could potentially require us to raise rates rapidly sometime  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL down the road, which, in turn, could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession.   We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and maintain our objectives.  That’s based on our view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate—that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel—is currently quite low by historical standards.  That means that the federal funds rate does not have to rise by all that much to get to a neutral policy stance.  We also expect the neutral level of the federal funds rate to rise somewhat over time, meaning that additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion.  Even so, the Committee continues to anticipate that the longer-run neutral level of the federal funds rate is still likely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades. This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.  The median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent at the end of next year, and 3 percent at the end of 2019, in line with its estimated longer-run value.  Compared with the projections made in December, the median path for the federal funds rate is essentially unchanged. As always, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to their economic outlooks and views of the risks to their outlooks.  Changes in economic policies, including fiscal and other policies, could potentially affect the economic outlook.  Of course, it is still too early to know how these policies will unfold.  Moreover, fiscal policy is only one of many factors that can influence the outlook.  In making our decisions, we will continue—as  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL always—to assess economic conditions relative to our dual mandate.  As I’ve noted previously, policy is not on a preset course. Finally, we will continue to reinvest proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.  This policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, has helped maintain accommodative financial conditions.  As a matter of prudent planning, we discussed at this meeting a number of issues related to an eventual change to our reinvestment policy.  We made no decisions, and we will continue our discussion at subsequent meetings.  In keeping with the principle that the process of normalizing our balance sheet will be gradual and predictable, we will provide more information about our plans as it becomes available. Thank you.  I’d be happy to take your questions. 

[SECTION]

SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.  Could I take you up on the last topic, which is the balance sheet normalization?  Clearly you said you don’t want to start pulling in the size of the balance sheet until normalization “is well under way.”  Could you give us some sort of sense about what “well under way” means, at least in your mind?  What kind of hurdles are you setting?  What kind of economic conditions would you like to see?  Is it just a matter of the level of the short-term federal funds rate as being the main issue?  And what kind of role do you see the role of the balance sheet playing in the normalization process over the longer term?  Is it an active tool, or is it a passive tool?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me start with the second question first.  We’ve emphasized for quite some time that the Committee wishes to use variations in the fed funds rate target—our short-term interest rate target—as our key active tool of policy.  We think it’s much easier in using that tool to communicate the stance of policy.  We have much more experience with it and  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL have a better idea of its impact on the economy.  So while the balance sheet, asset purchases are a tool that we could conceivably resort to if we found ourselves in a serious downturn where we were, again, up against the zero bound and faced with substantial weakness in the economy, it’s not a tool that we would want to use as a routine tool of policy. You asked what “well under way” means.  I can’t give you a specific answer to that.  And I think the right—the right way to look at it is in qualitative and not quantitative terms.  It doesn’t mean some particular cutoff level for the federal funds rate that, when we’ve reached that level, we would consider ourselves well under way.  I think what we want to have is confidence in the economy’s trajectory, a sense that the economy will make progress, that we’re not overly worried about downside risks and adverse shocks that could hit the economy that could quickly—after setting it off on the path to shrinking the balance sheet gradually over time—cause us to want to begin to add monetary policy accommodation.  So I think it has to do with the balance of risks and confidence in the economic outlook and not simply the level of the federal funds rate. 

[SECTION]

JASON LANGE.  Hi, thank you.  Jason Lange with Reuters.  You mentioned that you don’t—that you don’t—you want to not have to raise rates rapidly if you were to fall behind the curve.  In the current context, “gradual” has been very, very gradual.  Could you describe what a rapid rate of increases should be—how that should be understood? 

[SECTION]

 CHAIR YELLEN.  So I’m not sure that I can tell you what “a rapid rate of increases” is.  I think the trajectory that you see is the median in our projections, which, this year, looks to a total of three increases.  That certainly qualifies as gradual.  My comfort in using the term “gradual” comes back, in part, to my judgment that the neutral level of the federal funds rate—namely, the level of the federal funds rate that would keep the economy operating on an even  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL keel, that it’s a rate where we neither are pressing on the brake nor pushing down on the accelerator—that level of interest rates is quite low.  So, at present, I see monetary policy as accommodative—namely, the current level of the federal funds rate is below that neutral rate, but not very far below the neutral rate. We’re closing in, I think, on our employment objective.  We’re coming closer on our inflation objective.  As we reach those objectives, and particularly in light of the fact that we see the risks to the outlook as roughly balanced at this point—and that’s been our assessment for the last several meetings—it looks to us to be appropriate to gradually raise the federal funds rate back in the direction of neutral.  And exactly how many increases is that?  You know, the SEP gives you a sense of what Committee participants envision in a concrete sense.  But, you know, if it’s one more or one less, I think that still—that still qualifies to my mind as gradual, I think, if you compare it with any previous tightening cycle.  I remember when rates were raised at every meeting starting in mid-2004.  And I think people thought that was a gradual pace, a measured pace.  And we’re certainly not envisioning something like that. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Both the OECD and the IMF have raised their forecasts, in part because of—for the U.S. growth—in part because of the policies expected from the new Administration, yet the Fed has not.  And I take it from your comment at the very beginning that this—these forecasts today represent no reassessment.  Has the Committee discussed what policy might look like in the event that there are large tax cuts passed or infrastructure spending passed?  And what might policy look like if those policies become law?  Finally, why did you remove the word “only” before the word “gradual” when you talked about future rate increases?             CHAIR YELLEN.  So we have not discussed in detail potential policy changes that could  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL be put into place, and we have not tried to map out what our response would be to particular policy measures.  We recognize that there is great uncertainty about the timing, the size, the character of policy changes that may be put in place and don’t think that that’s a decision, or a set of decisions, that we need to make until we know more about what policy changes will go into effect.  So I do want to emphasize that, while some participants have penciled in some fiscal policy changes into their projections, that the basis for today’s decision is simply our assessment of the progress of the economy against our long-established goals of maximum employment and price stability.  There’s nothing that we have done or anticipate that is a speculation.  I think it’s fair to say, there’s nothing that’s a speculation about preemptive responses to future policy moves.  We have plenty of time to see what happens. We did remove the word “only” in the statement today from “gradual.”  I think this is something that shouldn’t be overinterpreted.  I regard it as a relatively small change and think it’s appropriate for you to consider it in the context, for example, of the fact that our economic projections are virtually identical to those that we issued in December.  They’re essentially unchanged both in terms of the path of the economy and the path of the federal funds rate.  So we have carried out a modest adjustment of the federal funds rate because we’ve seen the economy progressing over the last several months in exactly the way that we anticipated.  We haven’t in any way changed our view about where the economy is heading or the risks.  We had long said that if the economy progressed, and—it’s, you know, it’s been doing nicely, I think, in making progress, in showing resilience, and we have, you know, have some confidence in the path the economy is on.  And if we continue to feel that, we will likely regard it as appropriate to make some further moves to scale back accommodation to move toward neutral, along the lines in the SEP.  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL Now, obviously, there are surprises.  Our economic forecasts can change.  But the word “gradual,” I think, emphasizes that if things continue in the manner that we’ve been going, as we have said now for quite some time, we think that gradual—some gradual increases in the federal funds rate—will be appropriate.  And this is not a, you know, this is not a significant—this is not a significant change.

PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes, Fox Business, ma’am.  Speaking of fiscal policy, have you had a chance to meet with the new Treasury Secretary yet, Mr. Mnuchin?  If not, when will you meet with him?  What do you want to talk to him about?  And, separately, have you had a chance to talk to President Trump yet or meet with him?  And, if not, would you like to, and would you, and what would you talk about?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  I’ve met a couple of times with the Treasury Secretary, and I’m getting to know him.  And I think, you know, it’s traditional for Fed Chairs and Treasury Secretaries to meet on a regular basis, and I fully expect to have a strong relationship with Secretary Mnuchin.  We have had very good discussions about the economy, about regulatory objectives, the work of the FSOC, global economic developments, and I look forward to continuing to work with him.  I was introduced to the President.  I had a very brief meeting and appreciated that as well. 

[SECTION]

ANA SWANSON.  Ana Swanson, the Washington Post.  You said that the neutral level of the federal funds rate is quite low.  How close do you judge it to be to the inflation rate?  And what do you anticipate will be the force pushing up the neutral interest rate over the next few years?  Could fiscal policy be among those? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I’ve given a number of recent speeches on this topic where I’ve developed my views more fully.  I would say, over the longer run—that means going several  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL years out—I think the evidence suggests that the neutral rate may be something, in real terms, that might be close to 1 percent or a little bit under that.  That would be consistent with the median longer-run value of the federal funds rate in our economic projections for the last several meetings.  Three percent is the longer-run normal federal funds rate that participants estimate.  In real terms, with a 2 percent inflation objective—that’s 1 percent in real terms.  And I’ve indicated—why is it so low?  Well, I think there’s very strong evidence that’s accumulated that this rate has been falling not just in the United States, but in many advanced nations, and the growth and also slow productivity growth here and in many other advanced nations.  But some recent work suggests that, at the present time, the neutral real rate is yet lower than that, and some estimates place it around zero in real terms.  So I think the lower current rate arguably reflects headwinds that are left over from the financial crisis.  One form of headwind, I think, has been caution and restraint and risk aversion on the part of households and businesses that’s held back spending decisions.  And, I suppose, my judgment that it’ll move up over time reflects a notion that part of that will gradually dissipate over the years. So that’s a sense of where I think—now, there is uncertainty about the neutral rate.  And, as you mentioned, it is—it can be affected by shifts in fiscal policy.  How the neutral rate is affected by fiscal policy—that really depends importantly on the nature, the size of the fiscal shift and the effect it has both on demand and supply in the economy.

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Yellen, between the release of the minutes of the previous meeting late last month and your speech in Chicago earlier this month, market expectations about an increase in rates today changed quite dramatically.  What happened over the course of those two weeks to make officials far more  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL interested in signaling the idea of raising rates at today’s meeting?  And why do you think the 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, when I look at our sequence of communications, they seem to me to have been reasonably consistent over this entire period.  We had indicated in December that we expect—we saw the risks as balanced, and if the economy continued to progress along the lines we expected, that several rate increases would likely be appropriate.  The minutes of our be appropriate fairly soon if things continued along those lines.  I indicated in my congressional testimony that I thought that, indeed, the economy was progressing in line with our expectations.  And, as I think all of us—having that expectation and that if the economy continued to progress along the lines that we expected and we continued to see the risks as balanced—do regard it as appropriate to gradually remove accommodation that’s in place by having several interest rate increases this year.  As we saw the data continue to come in in line with our expectations, my colleagues and I spoke out and indicated that, indeed, that had been and continued to be our expectations. Now, you know, when you ask me, how did we get out of sync with the market, this is something I tried to reflect on a bit in the remarks I made in Chicago.  And, of course, it is true that in 2015 and in 2016 each, we raised the federal funds rate only once, and perhaps market participants have been influenced by that pattern.  I did try to explain the reasons why we had moved so slowly during those two years.  And it reflects, I think, a set of shocks partly emanating from the global economy and risks that we saw to the outlook as well as more fundamental assessments—reassessments pertaining to the neutral level of the federal funds rate and the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate.  So I think there are reasons, but it is  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL important for the public to understand that we’re getting closer to reaching our objectives; that policy is accommodative; that although the level of the neutral federal funds rate is probably quite low, we nevertheless have an accommodative stance of policy; and it will be appropriate to gradually move toward a neutral stance if we continue on the path we’re on.

 BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.  The Bank for International Settlements has raised concerns that central banks are being insufficiently attentive to asset price—excuse me, asset price inflation.  And stock market investors in the United States certainly don’t seem to be waiting for the Trump Administration to actually implement its fiscal policies.  And I guess I’m just curious to know how much of a concern that is for you.  And, if not, why not, given the remarkably elevated level of stock price evaluations? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we do look at financial conditions in formulating our view of the outlook, and stock prices do figure into financial conditions.  So I think the higher level of stock prices is one factor that looks like it’s likely to somewhat boost consumption spending.  We also noticed that, in the last several months, that risk spreads, particularly for lower-grade corporate issuers, have narrowed, which is another signal that financial conditions have become somewhat easier.  Now, on the other side, longer-term interest rates are up some in recent months, and the dollar is a little stronger.  How does that net out?  There are private-sector analysts that produce financial conditions indices that attempt to aggregate all these different factors affecting financial conditions.  And for some of the more prominent analysts and indices, I think the conclusion they have reached is that financial conditions, on balance, have eased, and that’s partly driven by the stock market.  So that is a factor that affects the outlook. Mnuchin will be meeting with your G-20 colleagues in Germany this weekend.  What do you  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL expect to find there?  Do you think the group assessment is going to be that the world economy is finally out of the woods, doing better?  Or do you think that there’s still going to be worries about risk?  And would one of those risk worries be that the Fed might raise rates too quickly? 

[SECTION]

 CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we always exchange views on the economic outlook and developments in our country, and it will be my objective to explain—explain U.S. monetary policy and to try to make the same points to them that I’ve made here already today about what the outlook is for monetary policy in the United States.  I think it’s fair to say that the global economy is doing better.  It’s growing a bit more strongly than it was, perhaps, the last time I got together that the—with my counterparts in the G-20—that the risks do look somewhat more balanced.  But there remain a set of very significant risks, medium term, facing the global economy, and I’m sure that those will be discussed as well.

JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Hi, Jim Puzzanghera with the Los Angeles Times.  You said you and your colleagues aren’t making assumptions about stimulative fiscal policies, but many other people are.  Business and consumer confidence has jumped since the election.  Homebuilder sentiment today was at its highest level since 2005.  Are you concerned about the effects on the economy if some of these policies, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending, don’t get enacted or are delayed? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So we recognize—our statement actually last time noted that there had been an improvement, a marked improvement in business and household sentiment.  It’s uncertain just how much sentiment actually impacts spending decisions.  And I wouldn’t say at this point that I have seen hard evidence of any change in spending decisions based on expectations about the future.  We exchange around the table what we learn from our many business contacts, and I think it’s fair to say that many of my colleagues and I note a much more  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL optimistic frame of mind among many—many businesses in recent months.  But, I’d say, most of the business people that we’ve talked to also have a wait-and-see attitude and are very hopeful that they will be able to expand investment and are looking forward to doing that but are waiting to see what will happen.  So we will watch that.  And, of course, if we were to see a major shift in spending reflecting those expectations, that could very well affect the outlook.  I’m not seeing it—I’m not seeing that at this point, but the shift in sentiment is obvious and notable.

KATE DAVIDSON.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Kate Davidson from Dow Jones.  There’s a perception out there that the Fed could somehow stand in the way of some of the economic growth policies that the new Administration is pursuing.  Given that the Fed is projecting 1.8 percent growth in the long run, is this a potential point of conflict for the Fed and the new Administration? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I don’t believe it is a point of conflict.  We would certainly welcome stronger economic growth in a context of price stability.  And if policies were put in place to speed growth that I’ve certainly urged Congress and the Administration to consider—policies that would boost productivity growth and raise the economy’s so-called speed limit or potential to grow—I think that those would be—those would be very welcome changes that we would like to see. 

[SECTION]

KATHLEEN HAYS.  Chair Yellen, Kathleen Hays.  Oh, excuse me, Kathleen Hays from Bloomberg.  I’m going to try to take the opposite side of this because—on this question about suddenly clarified what it already said.  But, for example, if the—if you look at the Atlanta Fed’s latest GDP tracker for the first quarter, it’s down to 0.9 percent.  We had a retail sales report that was mixed.  Granted the, you know, upward revisions of previous months make it look better,  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL but the consumer does not appear to be roaring in the first quarter, kind of underscoring the wait-and-see attitude you just mentioned. If you look at measures of labor compensation, you note in the statement that they’re not moving up, and, in fact, they are.  And if you look at average—there are so many things you can look at.  And you yourself have said in the past that the fact that that is happening is perhaps an indication there’s still slack in the labor market. I guess my question is this:  In another sense, what happened between December and inflation any time fast.  The consumer is not picking up very much.  Fiscal policy—we don’t know what’s going to happen with Donald Trump.  And yet you have to raise rates now.  So what is the—what is the motivation here?  The economy is so far from your forecast in terms of GDP, why does the Fed have to move now?  What does this signal, then, about the rest of the year? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So GDP is a pretty noisy indicator.  If one averages through several quarters, I would describe our economy as one that has been growing around 2 percent per year.  And as you can see from our projections, we—that’s something we expect to continue over the next couple of years.  Now, that pace of growth has been consistent with a pace of job creation that is more rapid than what is sustainable if labor force participation begins to move down in line with what we see as its longer-run trend with an aging population. Now, unemployment hasn’t moved that much, in part because people have been drawn into the labor force.  Labor force participation, as I mentioned in my remarks, has been about flat over the last three years.  So, in that sense, the economy has shown over the last several years that it may have had more room to run than some people might have estimated, and that’s been  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL good.  It’s meant we’ve had a great deal of job creation over these years.  And there could be—there could be room left for that to play out further.  In fact, look, policy remains accommodative.  We expect further improvement in the labor market.  We expect the unemployment rate to move down further and to stay down for the next several years.  So we do expect that the path of policy we think is appropriate is one that is going to lead to some further strengthening in the labor market. 

[SECTION]

KATHLEEN HAYS.  [Inaudible]  Just quickly, then, I just want to underscore—I want to ask you, so following on that, you expect it to move.  But what if it doesn’t?  What if GDP doesn’t pick up?  What if you don’t see wage measures rising?  What if you don’t—what if the core PCE gets stuck at 1.7 percent?  Would you—is it your view, perhaps, that if there’s a risk right now in the median forecast for dots, that it’s fewer hikes this year, rather than the consensus, or more? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, look, our policy is not set in stone.  It is data dependent, and we’re—we’re not locked into any particular policy path.  Our—you know, as you said, the data have not notably strengthened.  I—there is noise always in the data from quarter to quarter, but we haven’t changed our view of the outlook.  We think we’re on the same path, not—we haven’t boosted the outlook, projected faster growth.  We think we’re moving along the same course we’ve been on, but it is one that involves gradual tightening in the labor market.  I would describe some measures of wage growth as having moved up some.  Some measures haven’t moved up, but there’s some evidence that wage growth is gradually moving up, which is also suggestive of a strengthening labor market. And we expect policy to remain accommodative now for some time.  So we’re—we’re talking about a gradual path of removing policy accommodation as the economy makes progress  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL moving toward neutral.  But we’re continuing to provide accommodation to the economy that’s allowing it to grow at an above-trend pace that’s consistent with further improvement in the labor market.

JOHN HELTMAN.  Hi, John Heltman with the American Banker.  A regulatory question, if I may.  The Administration has recently reiterated its support for a reinstatement of Glass-Steagall.  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has called for a “21st century Glass-Steagall.”  Keeping in mind that there are no specifics on this proposal, is the fundamental idea of right path to be pursuing? 

[SECTION]

 CHAIR YELLEN.  So I’ve not seen any concrete proposals along this line.  I don’t really know what a “21st century Glass-Steagall” would look like.  I think my reading on the financial crisis is that that wasn’t the major source of the financial crisis.  In fact, many of the problems emanated from firms that were investment banking units.  To me, an important reform in the aftermath of the crisis was to make sure that investment banking activities where—that were a core part of the shadow banking system where leverage had built—that those were appropriately capitalized, had appropriate liquidity, and their management was strengthened, and that’s what we have tried to do.  But, obviously, we would look at any proposals that are put forward.  I’m not aware of anything concrete to react to. 

[SECTION]

 JOHN HELTMAN.  So—so you don’t think it’s necessarily [inaudible] a really good

JO LING KENT.  Hi, Chair Yellen.  I’m Jo Ling Kent with NBC News.  I just want to know, what message are you trying to send consumers with this particular rate hike? 

[SECTION]

 CHAIR YELLEN.  I think that’s a great question.  I appreciate your asking it.  And the simple message is, the economy is doing well.  We have confidence in the robustness of the economy and its resilience to shocks.  It’s performed well over the last several years.  We have created, since the trough in employment after the financial crisis, around 16 million jobs.  The unemployment rate has moved way down, and many more people feel optimistic about their prospects in the labor market.  There is job security.  We’re seeing more people who are feeling free to quit their jobs, getting outside offers, looking for other opportunities.  So I think the job That’s not to say that it’s a—good labor market conditions for every individual in the United States.  We know there are problems that face, particularly, people with less skill and education and in certain sectors of the economy, but many Americans are enjoying a stronger labor market and feel better—feel very much better about that.  And inflation is moving—moving up, I think, toward our 2 percent objective.  And we’re operating in an environment where the U.S. economy is performing well and risks seem pretty balanced.  So I think people can feel good about the economic outlook. 

[SECTION]

 JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Jeanna Smialek, Bloomberg News.  You emphasized in the statement that the Fed’s inflation target is “symmetric.”  Would you be able to expand a little bit on why you did that, why it was included, how much of an overshoot would the Fed be willing to tolerate, and for how long? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, a couple of years ago, we included the word “symmetric” in our statement of longer-run goals, and this seemed like an appropriate time to introduce that  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL word into the statement because we had previously indicated that there was a shortfall of inflation from our 2 percent objective.  Now, headline inflation has moved almost back up to 2 percent.  As I indicated, a better forward-looking measure of inflation, core inflation—that’s not our target, but I think it’s worth looking at because it’s a better forward-looking predictor of headline inflation—I think that’s still running a little bit under 2 percent, but we expect it’s going to move up to 2.  And this seemed like a good time to remind Americans that what our objective is is 2 percent inflation.  Inflation is not always going to be at 2 percent.  It’s—like all economic variables, it fluctuates.  Sometimes it’s going to be below 2 percent, sometimes it’s going to be above 2 percent.  We’ve had a long period in which inflation has run under 2 percent.  As we move back to 2 percent, which is where we’re heading, there will be some times when it’s above 2 percent as well.  And it’s a reminder—2 percent is not a ceiling on inflation, it’s a target.  It’s where we always want inflation to be heading.  And there will be some times when inflation is above 2 percent, just like it’s been below 2 percent.  We’re not shooting for inflation above 2 percent, but it’s a reminder that there will be deviations above and below when we’re achieving our objective. 

[SECTION]

 JEANNA SMIALEK.  How well can you tolerate an overshoot? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we would—if there were an overshoot and it appeared to be persistent, we would put in place policies to try to bring inflation back to 2 percent.  That’s the core set of principles that we have adopted in our statement on longer-run goals and strategy.  And exactly how long it would take to get back to 2 percent would depend, in part, on what was happening with respect to employment and our other objectives.  So there’s no hard and fast answer to that.  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

 PATRICK GILLESPIE.  Chair Yellen, Patrick Gillespie with CNN.  Some fiscal policy proposals, such as the border adjustment tax, would cause the dollar to strengthen significantly over a short period of time.  I realize you can’t comment on the specific policy proposal, but if the dollar were to strengthen quickly over a short period of time, perhaps some 20 percent for whatever reason, what would—what do you think the impact would be on the U.S. economy, particularly in exports and manufacturing?  And what do you think would be any implications for U.S. monetary policy? 

[SECTION]

 CHAIR YELLEN.  So that’s a—that’s a difficult question to answer.  You asked that question not in an isolated way:  What would the impact of a large appreciation of the dollar be? But, as I understand it, you asked about it in the context of a border tax adjustment.  Is that right? Because the argument that is made is that what a border tax would do without an exchange rate adjustment is to raise the price of imported goods into the United States.  And that large movement in the dollar that analysts claim would occur would essentially—if it were complete, would fully offset the impact of the border tax on U.S. import goods.  So, it wouldn’t end up having an impact on U.S. inflation or GDP growth. But a question that’s a very different—that’s a very different matter than if, suddenly, for some reason, the dollar were simply to begin appreciating by a large amount, say, because there were flight-to-safety flows into the dollar.  I mean, if—if the latter were to occur, there were just a big boost in the dollar, it would tend to put downward pressure on inflation and would have a negative effect on U.S. export growth and tend to boost imports.  But that’s a, that’s a different—that’s a different exercise.  I would just say, it’s very uncertain exactly what would happen to the dollar.  There has been a lot of discussion of that, and I think it’s complicated and uncertain.  March 15, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL

 VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Yellen.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  My question is about Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee wrote to you asking that the Fed not put forward any regulations until a Vice Chair of Supervision is in place.  So I have a couple of questions about that.  One is, are you all pulling back at all on any regulations—maybe not all regulations, but, you know, maybe only going forward with ones that you see as more time sensitive?  And during the hearing before that committee, you mentioned specifically the CCAR stress-test rule would have to come out sometime before that next cycle.  Are there any other time-sensitive regulations? 

[SECTION]

 CHAIR YELLEN.  So at this point we don’t have a lot of time-sensitive regulations.  There is nothing right now that we need to get out that’s a significant rule.  So we have a relatively light regulatory agenda at this point.  We recognize, of course, that we do have an obligation to write the rules that Congress, you know, dictates in laws that they pass, and so that is an ongoing obligation—obligation that we have.  But our calendar is relatively light at this

17,2017-06-14,"CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  Before I get started, I just want to say that our thoughts are with those who were injured this morning. Today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1 to 1¼ percent.  Our decision to make another gradual reduction in the amount of policy accommodation reflects the progress the economy has made, and is expected to make, toward maximum employment and price stability objectives assigned to us by law. We also released today, as an addendum to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, additional information on the process that we will follow in normalizing the size of our balance sheet once we determine that it is appropriate to begin doing so.  I’ll have more to say about our interest rate decision and our balance sheet policy, but first I’ll review recent economic developments and the outlook. Following a slowdown in the first quarter, economic growth appears to have rebounded, resulting in a moderate pace of growth so far this year.  Household spending, which was particularly soft earlier this year, has been supported by solid fundamentals, including ongoing improvement in the job market and relatively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth.  Business investment, which was weak for much of last year, has continued to expand.  And exports have shown greater strength this year, in part reflecting a pickup in global growth.  Overall, we continue to expect that the economy will expand at a moderate pace over the next few years.  In the labor market, job gains have averaged about 160,000 per month since the start of the year—a solid rate of growth that, although a little slower than last year, remains well above June 14, 2017  estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force.  The unemployment Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL rate has fallen about ½ percentage point since the beginning of the year and was 4.3 percent in estimates of its longer-run normal level.  Broader measures of labor market utilization have also improved this year.  Participation in the labor force has been little changed, on net, for about three years.  Given the underlying downward trend in participation stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population, a relatively steady participation rate is a further sign of improving conditions in the labor market.  Looking ahead, we expect that the job market will strengthen somewhat further. Turning to inflation, the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures was 1.7 percent in April, up from less than 1 percent last summer but down somewhat over the past few months.  Core inflation—which excludes the volatile food and energy categories and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation—has also edged lower.  The recent lower readings on inflation have been driven significantly by what appear to be one-off reductions in certain categories of prices, such as wireless telephone services and prescription drugs.  These price declines will, as a matter of arithmetic, restrain the 12-month inflation figures until the extraordinarily low March reading drops out of the calculation.  However, with employment near its maximum sustainable level and the labor market continuing to strengthen, the Committee still expects inflation to move up and stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years, in line with our longer-run objective.  Nonetheless, in light of the softer recent inflation readings, the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. Let me now turn to the economic projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting.  As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views  June 14, 2017  of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depend on each participant’s assessment of the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL many factors that shape the outlook.  The median projection for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, or real GDP, is 2.2 percent this year and edges down to 1.9 percent by 2019, slightly above its estimated longer-run rate.  The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and ticks down to 4.2 percent in 2018 and 2019, modestly below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate.  Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.6 percent this year and rises to 2 percent in 2018 and 2019.  Compared with the projections made in March, real GDP growth is little changed, the unemployment rate follows a moderately lower path, and inflation—although marked down this year for reasons I mentioned earlier—is unchanged over the following two years.  In addition, the median estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate moved down a tenth to 4.6 percent. Returning to monetary policy, for the past year and a half the FOMC has been gradually increasing its target range for the federal funds rate as the economy has continued to make progress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability.  Our decision today continues this process. We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective.  That’s based on our view that the federal funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral level—that is, the level of the federal funds rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel.  Because the neutral rate is currently quite low by historical standards, the federal funds rate would not have to rise all that much further to get to a neutral policy stance.  But because we also expect the neutral level of the federal funds rate to rise somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely  June 14, 2017  to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion.  Even so, the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL Committee continues to anticipate that the longer-run neutral level of the federal funds rate is likely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades. This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.  The median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent at the end of next year, and 2.9 percent at the end of 2019, about in line with its estimated longer-run value.  Compared with the projections made in March, the median path for the federal funds rate is essentially unchanged. As always, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to their economic outlooks and views of the risks to their outlooks.  As I’ve noted previously, policy is not on a preset course. Let me now turn to our balance sheet.  As I noted in our policy statement, we are continuing to maintain the size of our balance sheet by reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.  Provided that the economy evolves broadly as the Committee anticipates, we currently expect to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year.  Consistent with the principles and plans we released in 2014, this program would gradually decrease our reinvestments and initiate a gradual and largely predictable decline in our securities holdings. The addendum to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans that we released today provides further information.  For both Treasury and agency securities, we will reinvest proceeds from our holdings only to the extent that they exceed gradually rising caps on the reductions in our securities holdings.  Initially, these caps will be set at relatively low levels—$6 billion per  June 14, 2017  month for Treasuries and $4 billion per month for agencies.  So, any proceeds exceeding those Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL amounts would be reinvested.  These caps will gradually rise over the course of a year to maximums of $30 billion per month for Treasuries and $20 billion per month for agency securities and will remain in place through the normalization process.  By limiting the volume of securities that private investors will have to absorb as we reduce our holdings, the caps should guard against outsized moves in interest rates and other potential market strains. As I previously noted, when our securities holdings begin to gradually decline, so too will the supply of reserve balances in the banking system.  At some point, probably a few years down the road, the Committee will bring the decline in our balance sheet to an end as the quantity of reserves is normalized.  I can’t tell you what the longer-run normal level of reserve balances will be because that will depend on the Committee’s eventual decisions about how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively in the longer run, as well as a number of as-yet unknown elements, including the banking system’s future demand for reserves and various factors that may affect the daily supply of reserves.  What I can tell you is that we anticipate reducing reserve balances and our overall balance sheet to levels appreciably below those seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis. As readers of our minutes know, the Committee has on previous occasions discussed potential long-run frameworks for implementing monetary policy.  Decisions about the appropriate long-run framework do not need to be made for quite some time, and our future deliberations will benefit from the experience we will gain during the normalization process.  At this point, I’ll just point out that our current system is working well and has some important advantages.  In particular, it is simple and efficient to operate, does not require active management of the supply of reserves, and, most importantly, provides good control over the  June 14, 2017  federal funds rate and effective transmission of changes in the federal funds rate to broader Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL money market rates.  And because our current system is likely compatible with a much smaller quantity of reserves, our plan for gradually reducing our balance sheet does not constrain the Committee’s future options for how to implement monetary policy. Finally, as noted in today’s addendum, the Committee affirmed that changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  In other words, the balance sheet is not intended to be an active tool for monetary policy in normal times.  However, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a material deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds rate.  More generally, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate. Thank you.  I’ll now be happy to take your questions. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Yellen, the principles you released today say the balance sheet wind-down should commence once interest rate normalization is “well under way.”  With this latest rate increase, do you believe normalization is now well under way? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So that is something that we’ve said for some time, and I’ve previously—when I’ve been asked what “well under way” means—said that I don’t want to define that in purely quantitative terms but rather in qualitative terms.  So there’s no specific level of the federal funds rate that means we’re well under way.  But it’s also a question of not only the current level, but our confidence in the outlook and our projections for the future path of  June 14, 2017  the federal funds rate.  So we have increased our federal funds rate target now several times.  Our Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL outlook is that we anticipate further increases this year and next year for the federal funds rate, and our statement indicates that if the economy continues to evolve in the manner that we expect, that we would feel the conditions are in—will be in place to begin this process this year. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Madam Chair, I’m wondering if you’ve talked to the President or members of his staff about the possibility of staying on as Chair for a second term.  I’m also wondering if you would consider doing that—that’s something you thought about doing.  And, finally, there are three vacancies on the Fed.  Have you—do you have any comment at all for the President about his failure to nominate anybody for those three positions?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So what I’ve said about my own situation is that I fully intend to serve out my term as Chair, which ends in early February.  I have not had conversations with the President about future plans.  And I do very much hope—I know that they have been working hard to identify appropriate nominees for the open slots, and I do very much hope that there will be nominations in the not-too-distant future, and that the Senate will take those up expeditiously.  I look forward to having a full Board. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  And, I’m sorry, just to follow up:  Do you desire to stay on? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  I really don’t have anything for you at this point. 

[SECTION]

SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.  We’ve now had a very long streak of—or fairly long streak of weak inflation numbers, at least measured by the CPI this morning as well.  Marketplace-based inflation expectations are declining.  What kind of vigilance are you now saying is needed in terms of weak inflation?  How does that interact with your policy outlook?  And would further disappointments argue for pressing  June 14, 2017  “pause” on rate hikes or delaying balance sheet runoff?  How do you think about those two Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL potential responses to weak inflation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me just say, as I emphasized in my statement and always say, monetory policy is not on a preset course.  We indicated in our statement today that we’re closely monitoring inflation developments and certainly have taken note of the fact that there have been several weak readings, particularly on core inflation.  Our statement indicates that we expect inflation to remain low in the near term.  But, on the other hand, we continue to feel that with a strong labor market and a labor market that’s continuing to strengthen, the conditions are in place for inflation to move up.  Now, obviously we need to monitor that very carefully and ensure, especially with roughly five years of inflation running under our 2 percent objective—that is a goal to which the committee is strongly committed.  And we need to make sure that we have in place the policies that are necessary to achieve 2 percent inflation, and I pledge that we will do that. But let me say, with respect to recent readings, it’s important not to overreact to a few readings, and data on inflation can be noisy.  As I pointed out, there have been some idiosyncratic factors I think that have held down inflation in recent months, particularly a huge exceptionally low reading on core PCE in March, and that will continue to hold down 12-month changes until that reading drops out.  But we are—this morning’s reading on the CPI showed weakness in a number of categories, and it’s certainly something that we will be closely monitoring in the months ahead.  We will—we’re focused on making our policy decisions on the medium-term outlook, and we will, you know, be looking carefully at incoming data and, as always, revising our outlook and policy plans as appropriate.  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

SAM FLEMING.  Any implications for beginning of runoff and further increases in the  fed funds rate? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So—continue, as today’s actions show, to feel that the economy is doing well, is showing resilience.  We have a very strong labor market, an unemployment rate that’s declined to levels we have not seen since 2001.  And, even with some moderation in the pace of job growth, we have a labor market that continues to strengthen and policy remains—remains accommodative.  So, I—it’s important that inflation move up to our 2 percent objective, as our projections show we continue to expect that and believe the conditions are in place.  But we will monitor incoming data, obviously, and be attentive to rethinking our outlook if it seems appropriate. 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.  Hate to belabor the point on inflation, but I was wondering, I hear a lot of the so-called NAIRU in your conversation now and in other committee members’.  It’s an unobservable thing.  At best, it’s an estimate.  And the assumptions in there seem to me that the economy today is much like the economy yesterday, when, if anything, we’ve learned that the post-recession economy is vastly different than it was before the recession.  So I’m wondering, something you’ve talked about is to focus more on the change in inflation—actual inflation, and is it going up or is it going down, and basing policy more on that.  What would be the risk of that, and why not adopt that if you have such a long period of underperformance? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we are closely looking at the actual performance of inflation and altering our views on the basis of discrepancies between what we see and our expectations.  And, well, it is very difficult to pin down what is the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, and there’s a great deal of uncertainty about it, and it’s hard to pin down, especially given the  June 14, 2017  fact that the so-called Phillips curve appears to be quite flat.  That means that inflation doesn’t Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL respond very much or very quickly to movements in unemployment.  Nevertheless, that relationship, I believe, remains at work.  We have seen that operate historically.  Now, in the face of very low unemployment that we have seen, while wage growth has picked up somewhat, it remains low, and inflation is influenced by a number of different factors, but we certainly haven’t seen much or any evident upward pressure on inflation.  In light of that, the Committee has successively moved down its estimate of the normal longer-run rate of unemployment, and in this projection, it’s moved down to 4.6 percent, a tenth lower than it was last time.  So, while the unemployment rate is below that, it’s not that much—it’s not that much below it. 

[SECTION]

ANA SWANSON.  Ana Swanson, the Washington Post.  We saw measures of consumer and business confidence rise after inauguration on expectations that the Administration would move quickly to introduce policy changes like tax cuts and infrastructure spending.  But some of those policy changes have been slower to materialize than initially expected.  How do you view the positive and negative risks from policy changes to your outlook, and has your view changed on that at all in the last six months? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I would say that business and household sentiment remains quite strong, although many forecasters have pushed back somewhat the timing of the expected policy changes, such as changes to tax policy or fiscal policy more generally.  I would say that, based on my observation of actual spending behavior and my discussions with our wide range of contacts, that I haven’t seen very much evidence that, thus far, expectations of policy changes have driven substantial changes in either consumer spending or investment spending.  So I really wouldn’t expect any significant pullback.  Many of our business contacts—I think their  June 14, 2017  confidence remains high.  They’ve not really changed their plans yet, and they have a wait-and-Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL see attitude. quickly? 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.  Measures of financial conditions show that since the Fed started raising interest rates two years ago, financial conditions actually have loosened.  Consumer business borrowing costs in many cases are down.  Do you have the sense that the market is not listening to you?  How much of a concern is that for you?  And, at some point, does it convince you that you need to raise rates perhaps more 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, in deciding what the appropriate path of rates is, we take many different factors into account.  We have certainly noticed the stock market is up considerably over the last year.  That usually shows up in financial conditions indexes and is an important reason why some of them show easier financial conditions.  There’s been a modest decrease recently in the value of the dollar, although it’s up substantially since mid-2014.  So we take those factors into account in deriving our forecasts and deciding the appropriate stance of policy.  We have done that, and—but other things also affect the stance of policy.  So there really can’t be any simple relationship.  We’re not targeting financial conditions.  We’re trying to set a path of the federal funds rate, but taking account of those factors and others that don’t show up in a financial conditions index.  We’re trying to generate paths for employment and inflation that meet our mandated objectives. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  So, on inflation again, I just wonder, what’s the possibility that something more, sort of—I mean, nefarious is at work here, right, which is that the, sort of, weight of central bank credibility now—for a generation, really—plus globalization has just pushed the world into a low-inflation environment that’s going to be  June 14, 2017  very hard to get wages and prices moving again.  And then, related to that, you know, if NAIRU Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL is 4.2, why not 4 or why not 3.8?  You banked a quarter—you know, a full percentage point now, so you’re probably at less risk of falling behind whatever curve exists.  Why rush? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I don’t think central bank credibility—at least the Fed’s credibility—has been impaired.  We look at a whole variety of indicators of inflation expectations.  Professional forecasters—whether it’s in the Blue Chip or the Survey of Professional Forecasters, those expectations have remained quite steady and in close alignment with our 2 percent inflation target.  TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation do not provide straight reads on market participants’ estimates and expectations about inflation.  They embody other elements—risk premia and liquidity premia as well.  They had moved down and now have moved—they remain at low levels, but they have moved back up again.  It is true that some household surveys of inflation expectations have moved down, but overall I wouldn’t say that we’ve seen a broad undermining of inflation expectations. But you asked also, I guess, about have structural changes perhaps impacted the inflation process, and that certainly is possible.  And estimates of the normal longer-run unemployment rate—they are quite uncertain.  I agree with your assessment there.  We’re really not certain what they are.  And policy is not being—is not based on some firmly held preconceived notion.  We’re watching very carefully how the actual economy performs.  And, you know, I continue to believe, though, that with job growth running well in excess, even with the moderation of the level that’s needed to provide for new entrants in the labor market, we do have a strengthening economy.  With policy accommodative, all that we’re doing in raising rates is moving—removing a bit of accommodation heading toward a neutral pace.  And I see that as appropriate.  We’re not moving so aggressively as to put a brake on continued improvement in the labor  June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL accommodation, with unemployment now—and not only, I should say, the unemployment rate, but I think any indicator of labor market performance and tightness that you could look at, whether it’s household perceptions of the availability of jobs, difficulty that firms report in hiring workers, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, the rate of job openings, all of these indicators do signal a tight labor market. Now, with inflation below 2 percent, I think it’s appropriate that the labor market be that tight.  But, on the other hand, I think we want to avoid the risk.  We want to keep the expansion on a sustainable path and avoid the risk that at some point we need—we find ourselves in a situation where we’ve done nothing and then need to raise the funds rate so rapidly that we risk a recession.  So moving to some extent in a timely way to remove accommodation with a strong economy and continued labor market strength, the Committee believes, is an appropriate management of risks.  But we are attentive to the fact that inflation is running below our 2 percent objective, that we’ve faced that situation now for a long time, and it’s really quite essential that we put in place policies that will succeed in moving inflation back to our 2 percent objective, and it’s a symmetric objective.  So that’s a risk that we face as well.  The Committee believes we have conditions in place for inflation to move up, but that’s also a risk.  And those things point, I think, to a gradual pace of reducing accommodation. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Hi, Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace.  Recently, a group of economists sent the Fed a letter earlier this month disagreeing with your 2 percent inflation target and saying they would like the economy to run a bit hotter.  They don’t think the labor market is so tight.  You say you’re committed to the 2 percent target, but what do you say to them?  June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, at the time that we adopted the 2 percent target—it was back in 2012—we had a very thorough discussion of the factors that should determine what our inflation objective should be.  And, you know, I believe that was a well-thought-out decision.  Now, at the moment, we are highly focused on trying to achieve our 2 percent objective.  And we recognize the fact that inflation has been running below, and it’s essential for us to move inflation back to that objective. Now, we’ve learned a lot in the meantime, and assessments of the level of the neutral likely level, currently and going forward, of the neutral federal funds rate have changed and are quite a bit lower than they stood in 2012 or earlier years.  And that means that the economy is—has the potential where policy could be constrained by the zero lower bound more frequently than at the time that we adopted our 2 percent objective.  So it’s that recognition that causes people to think we might be better off with a higher inflation objective, and that’s an important set—this is one of our most critical decisions and one we are attentive to evidence and outside thinking.  It’s one that we will be reconsidering at some future time.  And it’s important for our outside the Fed.  But a reconsideration of that objective needs to take account not only of benefits of a higher in—potential benefits of a higher inflation target, but also the potential costs that could be associated with it.  It needs to be a balanced assessment.  But I would say that this is one of the most important questions facing monetary policy around the world in the future, and we very much look forward to seeing research by economists that will help inform our future 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Thank you.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times.  The Fed’s projections continue to show the longer-run federal funds rate at 3 percent.  The markets are expecting 2 percent.  How  June 14, 2017  big of a concern is that gap in your mind?  What are the reasons for the disconnect?  And, you Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL know, what are the implications and the risks for the real economy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me first say, it’s not straightforward to determine exactly what expectations are embodied in market prices because there are term premia that affect these rates, and they may not really be as low as one would infer from a straight read.  That said, in part, expectations reflect estimates of what the neutral federal funds rate is and how it’s likely to evolve over time.  And views have changed about that over time, and there is a good deal of uncertainty about it.  So we have recently put out charts that try to show what the range of uncertainty is around our path for the federal funds rate, especially as one goes further out.  There’s a good deal of uncertainty and—that reflects the, like—all the shocks that can affect the evolution of the economy, and also the fact, we’re quite uncertain ourselves about what the likely—what the evolution will be of the neutral federal funds rate. So we do try to write that down and provide the public with information about our current expectations.  And the median now stands at around 3 percent, but we have uncertainty about that.  Many of my colleagues and I think that the current neutral level is lower than that.  And as I said in my opening statement, the fed funds rate path reflects an expectation that that neutral rate will be moving up some in future years.  But that remains uncertain, and I think that’s something that market participants are trying to assess, and we will be as well. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  But do you see greater volatility in the markets as it adjusts to the difference in the gap between the expectation and what the Fed’s projections are for the longer-run federal 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, our expectations are little changed.  I mean, the projections we released today are essentially identical to those.  And I think the market is aware of the views of funds rate?  June 14, 2017  participants and is assessing evidence itself to form their own views.  And it’s important that the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL are interpreting evidence on the evolution of the economy.  So it’s not an unhealthy thing to have such a gap.  And, as I just said, our own views are not set in stone but are likely to evolve as well over time. you—the Fed first raised the possibility of trimming its bond purchases, it created a bit of turbulence in financial markets.  The taper tantrum caused you to reassess your communication of that process.  This trimming of the bond holdings, though—the financial markets seem to be taking that in a better way.  If down the road, though, you see that there is more of an adverse reaction, are you planning to make any changes, perhaps change the caps to $30 billion, in the $20 billion caps?  How do you assess how you’ll handle that going forward? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So we have indicated for quite some time, I guess, since our—at least since our 2014 normalization principles, that we wanted to reduce our balance sheet in a gradual and predictable way.  And we have tried systematically to communicate more about how we would do that as our plans have evolved.  And today’s announcement is another step in providing further details about how we plan to proceed so that when this plan does go into effect, no one is taken by surprise and market participants understand how this will work. I think that we—the plan is one that is consciously intended to avoid creating market strains and to allow the market to adjust to a very gradual and predictable plan.  My hope and expectation is that when we decide to go forward with this plan, that there will be very little reaction to it, that it’s clear how we intend to proceed, and that this is something that will just run quietly in the background over a number of years, leading to a reduction in the size of our  June 14, 2017  balance sheet and in the outstanding stock of reserves, and that it’s something that the Committee Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL will not be reconsidering from time to time.  We think this is a workable plan, and it will, as one of my colleagues, President Harker, described it, it will be like watching paint dry, that this will just be something that runs quietly in the background.  So that’s my expectation and our intention.  Look, of course, if it turns out that there is a surprise and a substantial reaction, that is something we would have to take into account in deciding on the appropriate stance of policy. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  A couple of comments from Administration officials I wanted to get your reaction to.  The Treasury Secretary and others have suggested that Dodd-Frank regulation and the way it’s been implied—applied have restricted credit growth in the economy, banks are not making loans that they otherwise would, and that has slowed growth.  Do you agree with that?  And if you get a new Vice Chair of Supervision who wanted to ease up on regulation, would you go along with that?  Also, I wanted to ask you—it’s been reported the President has congratulated you on being a “low interest” person.  Would you agree with that characterization of your philosophy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, with respect to the impact of credit conditions and bank regulation on slow growth, I’ve previously, in testifying, indicated that I don’t think that our regulations have played an important role, at least broadly speaking, in impeding credit growth and the growth of the economy.  And I’ve pointed in the past to a number of statistics suggesting that credit growth continues to be healthy, including among small—smaller community banks that are most concerned with regulatory burden.  I think when banks are undercapitalized and weak, that impedes credit growth.  And when banks are strong, they’re in a much better position to lend.  So that’s been a view that I’ve stated previously.  June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL Now, in terms of regulation, the Treasury recently issued, on Monday, a detailed report.  And that’s quite a complicated document with lots of recommendations in it.  I haven’t had a chance to review it thoroughly, so I don’t want to comment on too many details.  But I would say it underscores the importance of capital, liquidity, stress testing, and resolution planning in having a safe and sound banking system, which are views that I and my colleagues have long espoused.  Regulatory burden, when it’s possible to ease it, and a good deal of the Treasury report is focused on regulatory burden, that’s something that all regulators should be looking to do.  We strongly believe in the importance of tailoring our regulation to the size and complexity of institutions, of finding ways to relieve burden for community banks.  We have been focused and had a number of initiatives already in that direction, looking for ways, for example, to simplify capital requirements for community banks.  And we’ll continue in that direction and, in that sense, in those areas certainly share the views expressed in the Treasury report.  So there are a number of areas and suggestions where our thinking aligns well.  There is probably some areas where we’re likely to have differences but quite—you know, quite a number of areas where we’re, you know, likely to be able to and already are taking actions that are consistent with those recommendations. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  And the characterization of you as a low interest rate person?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I have felt that it’s been appropriate for interest rates to remain low for a very long time.  We are in the process of, as the economy strengthens, normalizing interest rates.  But, certainly, we’ve had a lot of years in which interest rates have been low.  I thought it was necessary to support the economy at that time and was strongly in favor of those policies.  June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

KAREN MRACEK.  Thank you, Karen Mracek with Market News International.  Today you guys outlined the details of the plan to—when you begin to end reinvestments.  But you stopped short of saying exactly when it would be implemented, only saying “this year,” and adding that that depended on how the economy evolved.  Can you tell us why you decided not to go ahead with it today?  Is there certain conditions that you’re looking for?  And then, as a second question, do you think that the—you could raise rates and begin implementation of the plan at the same time?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So we have tried as meticulously as we can to provide advanced warning to markets about how we would go about doing this so that market participants can prepare.  And today’s announcement is another step in that process.  So we certainly wanted to get this information out before we actually undertake the beginning of this plan.  And, you know, as the statement says, we’ve made no definite decision on the timing of the plan, but—the timing of initiating the plan.  But if the economy evolves in line with our expectations, which, you know, we will be watching—always are—we could put this into effect relatively soon.  You asked about whether or not we would do that and raise rates at the same meeting, and I would say, we’ve made no decision about that, and it really hinges on the outlook and our assessment of conditions. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.  You mentioned the Treasury report, and I just wanted to ask, how much weight do you give those recommendations in considering, you know, potential regulatory changes moving forward?  And also, more specifically, one of the recommendations relates to the Volcker rule.  I know you’ve said in the past that, you know, it might be a good idea to reduce the burden on community banks, but it also talks about potentially exempting banks with trading assets and liabilities above a certain  June 14, 2017  level.  And I was wondering if you think that that’s an idea that’s worth exploring, that might be Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL a good idea. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So we have previously suggested exempting community banks, smaller banks, entirely from the rule.  And a number of my colleagues have spoken about the Volcker rule.  Implementation of it is frankly complex, and I’m certainly open to looking at ways to reduce regulatory burden in that area.  The report endorses a restriction on proprietary trading.  So, in that sense, it endorses the main objective of the Volcker rule, which I was pleased to see.  But on implementation, it’s true that the rules were—in part reflecting the way the legislation is written—were, I think, necessarily complex, but we do have some ideas for how we might simplify the rule, and certainly it’s something we’re quite open to looking at. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  And how much weight do you give Treasury recommendations? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I mean, Treasury has a—set out a list of objectives for regulation that I’m sympathetic to and endorse.  I think looking for ways to reduce regulatory burden, when it can be done without sacrificing safety and soundness or creating systemic risk, that’s something that all regulators should want to do.  We’ve done an awful lot of rule writing over the last five or six years.  And coming back and looking at where we have created burdens and ways in which we can simplify to reduce, that is an objective that is core to the Treasury review and that we are very sympathetic with.  So, while we may not agree on every detail, certainly the suggestions that are made there are ones that we will pay attention to and in many cases are already on our own list of things we should review.

MICHAEL DERBY.  Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires.  In light of the plans to trim the balance sheet hopefully later this year, what have you learned about QE and your bond-buying policies as a tool for monetary policy?  When they were launched, it wasn’t something  June 14, 2017  you had, you know, engaged in on that scale before—a lot of fears that it was going to create Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL hyperinflation.  That hasn’t ever seemed to come to pass.  So, in light of QE as potentially a tool for the future—you know, it might come back again—what have you learned about how it works in the economy?  Like, where do you see it affect things?  You know, what are sort of the lessons learned of the experience?

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, thanks.  That’s a great question.  I mean, staff in the Federal Reserve and outside economists have done a great deal of work trying to evaluate QE.  I think the general conclusion is that it has worked in that it has put some downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, so-called term premiums embedded in longer-term interest rates.  There’s disagreement among economists about exactly how large those effects are, and it’s something that’s difficult to pin down.  But, obviously, it has not caused runaway inflation, quite the contrary.  I mean, that was never my expectation, but I do remember when people were afraid that that would happen. We do have the tools.  We have, you know, even with a large balance sheet—we intend to shrink our balance sheet now, but even with a large balance sheet, we retain the ability to move the fed funds rate and set it as appropriate for the needs of the economy.  So I think we have learned that it works.  It’s a valuable part of the toolkit.  It’s something that, if we were to encounter an episode in the future of extreme weakness where—I’ve said we want the fed funds rate and movements in short-term interest rates, that’s our go-to number one main policy tool—but if we were to hit the zero lower bound and constrained in our use of that tool, certainly balance sheet policies and forward guidance of the type that we provided, I believe, based on the evidence of how they worked, ought to remain part of our toolkit.  And we have said in the  June 14, 2017  bullets that we released today on our balance sheet that in such of—an episode of such extreme Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL weakness in the future, those are things we would consider going forward.

MICHAEL DERBY.  One small follow-up.  Is $4½ trillion sort of a natural limit to how high you might want to push the balance sheet, or could you envision it going higher if you needed it to? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we’ve had no discussion of that issue, you know.  And our focus now is on getting it back to a more normal size.  But I would say, the use of QE in the United States relative to the size of our economy is not as high as it’s been in some other countries that have employed it.  But that’s something we haven’t seriously even discussed.

PATRICK GILLESPIE.  Chair Yellen, Patrick Gillespie with CNN.  It’s workforce development week at the White House, and you highlighted several job training—successful job training programs in your speech in March.  The President’s budget has a 40 percent cut to job training programs.  What is your response to the budget cut to job training programs even though they expect to expand apprenticeship programs?  And do you believe that job training programs and apprenticeships are needed to help fix the job skills gap in the economy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I’m not going to comment on the President’s budget, and these programs can be undertaken at many different levels.  I’ve seen many nonprofits and states and local authorities put in place programs that looked to me to be successful.  I do think we have a tight labor market and one where employers have jobs where they’re finding difficulty identifying workers with the appropriate skills.  In my own discussions with businesses, what I hear more of—and this is something I think is a great aspect of a tight labor market—larger firms are spending more on training and trying to, given that they can’t hire workers with the ideal skills, are training people to fill jobs that they have available.  What I hear from CEOs of smaller  June 14, 2017  firms is that they don’t have the ability to launch such programs.  They would really very much Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL like to participate along, for example, with community colleges or nonprofits to see such programs launched and have jobs that people could fill if they received the appropriate training.  So I do think that this is an important area, and, especially given the pressures that have, you know, existed for a long time—downward pressure on wages and job opportunities, especially for those with less skills—I think that this is something that deserves priority.  ",Janet Yellen,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
18,2017-09-20,"CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  At our meeting that concluded earlier today, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1¼ percent.  This accommodative policy should support some further strengthening in the job market and a return to 2 percent inflation, consistent with our statutory objectives.  We also decided that in October we will begin the balance sheet normalization program that we outlined in June.  This program will reduce our securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner.  I’ll have more to say about these decisions shortly, but first I’ll review recent economic developments and the outlook. As we expected, and smoothing through some variation from quarter to quarter, economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year.  Household spending has been supported by ongoing strength in the job market.  Business investment has picked up, and exports have shown greater strength this year, in part reflecting improved economic conditions abroad.  Overall, we expect that the economy will continue to expand at a moderate pace over the next few years. In the third quarter, however, economic growth will be held down by the severe disruptions caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.  As activity resumes and rebuilding gets under way, growth likely will bounce back.  Based on past experience, these effects are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy beyond the next couple of quarters.  Of course, for the families and communities that have been devastated by the storms, recovery will take time, and on behalf of the Federal Reserve, let me express our sympathy for all those who have suffered losses. September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL In the labor market, job gains averaged 185,000 per month over the three months ending in August—a solid rate of growth that remained well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force.  We know from some timely indicators, such as initial claims for unemployment insurance, that the hurricanes severely disrupted the labor market in the affected areas, and payroll employment may be substantially affected in September.  However, such effects should unwind relatively quickly.  Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has stayed low in recent months and, at 4.4 percent in August, was modestly below the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level.  Participation in the labor force has changed little, both recently and over the past four years.  Given the underlying downward trend in participation stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population, a relatively steady participation rate is a further sign of improving conditions in the labor market.  We expect that the job market will strengthen somewhat further. Turning to inflation, the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures was 1.4 percent in July, down noticeably from earlier in the year.  Core inflation—which excludes the volatile food and energy categories—has also moved lower.  For quite some time, inflation has been running below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective.  However, we believe this year’s shortfall in inflation primarily reflects developments that are largely unrelated to broader economic conditions.  For example, one-off reductions earlier this year in certain categories of prices, such as wireless telephone services, are currently holding down inflation, but these effects should be transitory.  Such developments are not uncommon and, as long as inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, are not of great concern from a policy perspective because their effects fade away. September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL Similarly, the recent hurricane-related increases in gasoline prices will likely boost inflation, but only temporarily.  More broadly, with employment near assessments of its maximum sustainable level and the labor market continuing to strengthen, the Committee continues to expect inflation to move up and stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years, in line with our longer-run objective.  Nonetheless, our understanding of the forces driving inflation is imperfect, and in light of the unexpected lower inflation readings this year, the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.  As always, the Committee is prepared to adjust monetary policy as needed to achieve its inflation and employment objectives over the medium term. Let me turn to the economic projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting, which now extend through 2020.  As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depend on each participant’s assessments of the many factors that shape the outlook.  The median projection for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, or real GDP, is 2.4 percent this year and about 2 percent in 2018 and 2019.  By 2020, the median growth projection moderates to 1.8 percent, in line with its estimated longer-run rate.  The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs a little above 4 percent over the next three years, modestly below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate.  Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.6 percent this year, 1.9 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2019 and 2020.  Compared with the projections made in June, real GDP growth is a touch stronger this year, and inflation—particularly core inflation—is slightly softer this year and next.  Otherwise, the projections are little changed from June. September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL Returning to monetary policy, although the Committee decided at this meeting to maintain its target for the federal funds rate, we continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective.  That expectation is based on our view that the federal funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral level—that is, the level that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel.  Because the neutral rate currently appears to be quite low by historical standards, the federal funds rate would not have to rise much further to get to a neutral policy stance.  But because we also expect the neutral level of the federal funds rate to rise somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion.  Even so, the Committee continues to anticipate that the longer-run neutral level of the federal funds rate is likely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades. This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.  The median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent at the end of next year, 2.7 percent at the end of 2019, and 2.9 percent in 2020.  Compared with the projections made in June, the median path for the federal funds rate is essentially unchanged, although the median estimate of the longer-run normal value edged down to 2.8 percent. As always, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to their economic outlooks and views of the risks to their outlooks.  Policy is not on a preset course. As I noted, the Committee announced today that it will begin its balance sheet normalization program in October.  This program, which was described in the June addendum to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, will gradually decrease our reinvestments of September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency securities.  As a result, our balance sheet will decline gradually and predictably.  For October through December, the decline in our securities holdings will be capped at $6 billion per month for Treasuries and $4 billion per month for agencies.  These caps will gradually rise over the course of the following year to maximums of $30 billion per month for Treasuries and $20 billion per month for agency securities and will remain in place through the process of normalizing the size of our balance sheet.  By limiting the volume of securities that private investors will have to absorb as we reduce our holdings, the caps should guard against outsized moves in interest rates and other potential market strains. Finally, as we have noted previously, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  Our balance sheet is not intended to be an active tool for monetary policy in normal times.  We therefore do not plan on making adjustments to our balance sheet normalization program.  But, of course, as we stated in economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds rate. Thank you.  I’d be happy to take your questions.

CHRISTOPHER CONDON.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Chair Yellen, there’s been extraordinary progress during your term as Chair in lowering several measures of unemployment and underemployment, and all while inflation has remained subdued.  But some people are even asking, why stop there?  Bill Spriggs, the chief economist at the AFL-CIO, who I think you know well, criticized the Fed last week for seeking to maintain unemployment above 4 percent, which he notes necessarily means keeping the unemployment rate among black Americans above 8 percent.  He described this as a deliberate policy to sacrifice many hundreds September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL of thousands of potential workers and their families out of fear of future inflation, when in fact the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation has not exceeded 3 percent in more than 25 years.  So I’m wondering how you would respond to his frustration over the Fed’s desire to continue raising rates when core inflation really shows no sign of heading above the Fed’s symmetric goal for inflation.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me first say that employment is a very important part of our mandate.  We’re charged by Congress with trying to pursue maximum employment, and we have taken that very seriously.  I’m very pleased and heartened by the improvement we have seen in the labor market, and at 4.4 percent, the unemployment rate has really fallen to quite a low level.  As that’s happened, the unemployment rates for less advantaged groups in the labor market, particularly African Americans and Hispanics, has fallen more dramatically than that for the nation as a whole, reversing the outsized increases that those groups experienced when the financial crisis and Great Recession hit.  And these are really very positive developments.  So we certainly seek a strong labor market, but we have a dual mandate, which is inflation and unemployment, and we also have to be mindful of our obligation to achieve a 2 percent inflation objective over the medium term. Now, I recognize and it’s important that inflation has been running under our 2 percent objective for a number of years, and that is a concern, particularly if it were to translate into lower inflation expectations.  For a number of years there were very understandable reasons for that shortfall, and they included quite a lot of slack in the labor market—which, my judgment would be, has largely disappeared—very large reductions in energy prices, and a large appreciation of the dollar that lowered import prices starting in mid-2014.  This year, the September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, when none of those factors is operative, is more of a mystery, and I will not say that the Committee clearly understands what the causes are of that. Now, we do, in our regular projection, show fan charts indicating the typical size of forecast errors.  All of the variables—GDP, the unemployment rate, and inflation—are forecast by ourselves and private forecasters with errors, and so there is variation in these economic variables from year to year.  I would say our judgment, as I said in the statement, is that the shortfall is not largely related to cyclical considerations.  You can see from the projections that the Committee participants submitted that we anticipate that core and headline inflation will move up close to our 2 percent objective next year—namely, that the shortfall this year is due to transitory factors that are likely to disappear over the course of the coming year. But I want to emphasize that we do have a commitment to raising inflation to 2 percent.  And as we watch incoming data, the assessments that you see participants write down about the path of the federal funds rate, they are not set in stone.  They are not definite plans.  We will look at incoming data on inflation and on other economic variables, including the labor market, in expectations that the shortfall is persistent, it will be necessary to adjust monetary policy to address that.  But I want to point out that while there are risks that inflation could continue below 2 percent, which we need to take account of in monetary policy, monetary policy also operates with a lag.  And experience suggests that tightness in the labor market, gradually and with a lag, tends to push up wage and price inflation, and that’s also a risk, that we want to be careful not to allow the economy to overheat in a way that would force us later on, somewhere down the road, to have to tighten monetary policy rapidly, which could cause a recession and threaten the very desirable labor market conditions that we have now. September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL

SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.  The Fed’s staff spoke recently about elevated asset prices in the markets in the most recent—in the meeting before this one held today.  How are buoyant market conditions affecting the debate at the moment about how quickly to rein in stimulus?  And have they, in your own mind, helped to counter some of the concerns you’ve had about the inflation shortfalls that we’ve been seeing?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So at every meeting we try to assess the economic outlook and take account of information that’s been accumulated about the real economy and also developments in financial markets and put all of that together in assessing the course of the economy.  So developments affecting asset prices and longer-term interest rates, the exchange rate—all of those aspects of financial conditions factor into our thinking. But it’s not easy to get a clear read on the implications of asset prices for the overall outlook.  Sometimes movements—upward movements in asset prices can, for example, reflect a change in market participants’—reduction in market participants’ estimates of the longer-run level of interest rates.  So there has been—there have been downward revisions both to the Committee’s and to market participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal level of interest rates, which in turn reflects in some sense a view that, going out many years, aggregate demand globally is likely to be weakened by continuing low productivity growth and aging populations.  And, of course, we don’t know if that view is correct, but that’s a factor that could be reflected—could be one reason why asset prices have moved as they have.  So, you know, why are asset prices moving?  That’s important in determining the impact on the overall outlook, but, certainly, we are taking account of movements in asset prices in evaluating the appropriate stance of policy. September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Madam Chair, you just said in your opening remarks that reducing the balance sheet should not be “an active tool for monetary policy in normal times,” you don’t plan to make adjustments to the balance sheet.  I’m wondering if we could explore if there’s any sensitivity to the plan you just announced if there’s a spike in interest rates, a plunge in the stock market, weakness in growth. In the June statement, you indicated that the only reason why you would change the—it suggested the only reason you’d change the balance sheet is if it required, first, a change in the funds rate.  Is that true?  If there’s some unexpected development in markets, or, for example, given that we don’t know what the plans are on the fiscal side for the deficit in terms of tax cuts—there could be a sudden spike in the deficit—will the balance sheet reduction plan be immune to all of that?  And, given that question, and the idea that this has never been done before, why so much certainty about the plan you’ve just announced and apparent unwillingness to adjust it? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So we have two policy tools that are available to us to use:  the balance sheet and adjustments in short-term interest rates—our federal funds rate target.  And, historically, the Committee has operated to adjust monetary conditions to meet our economic goals when there are shocks to the economy by adjusting the federal funds rate—our short-term interest rate target.  And that’s something—a technique of monetary control that we have used for a very long time that we are familiar with, we believe we understand pretty well what the effects are on the economy, market participants understand how that tool has been used and would likely be adjusted in response to shocks to the economy.  And our preference is, when we have two different tools that we could use to actively adjust the stance of policy, to prefer and to make a commitment that, to the maximum extent possible, the federal funds rate will be the September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL active tool of policy.  That’s our go-to tool.  That is what we intend to use unless we think that the threat to the economy is sufficiently great that we might have to cut the federal funds rate—after all, we’ve moved it up to 1 to 1¼ percent and expect it to go up further—but a very significant negative shock to the economy could conceivably force us back to the so-called zero lower bound.  We have said if there were that type of material deterioration in the outlook where we could face a situation where the federal funds rate isn’t a sufficient tool for us to adjust monetary policy, we might stop—we might stop roll-offs from our balance sheet and resume reinvestment.  But as long as we believe that we can use the federal funds rate as a tool, that is what we intend to do. So, if there are small changes in the outlook that require a recalibration of monetary policy, we will change our anticipated path and setting of the federal funds rate, but not, for example, change the caps on reinvestment or stop—continue reinvestment for a few months and then change it.  We think that provides greater clarity to market participants about how policy will be conducted and will be, will be less confusing and more effective in terms of conducting policy. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.  You have now committed to a policy of reducing your balance sheet very gradually.  You have described plans to raise interest rates even more gradually than previously.  You are locked in for a long period of time to a forecast that monetary policy will essentially keep interest rates at a low level and keep a balance sheet at a high level.  If something goes wrong, does the Fed have room to respond under these conditions in the next several years, and could you describe for us what your plans are for a response, should it be warranted? September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So the only thing I would object to there, is you said that we are “locked in,” and I would say that we are not locked in.  We believe that economic conditions will evolve in a way that will warrant gradual, further increases in our federal funds rate target, but if conditions evolve differently than that, whichever direction that might be—it might be that growth is more rapid, the labor market tightens more quickly than we assume, and inflation appears to be picking up more rapidly than we had expected—we have not promised, no matter what, that the path of interest rate increases will be gradual.  We believe that that will be appropriate, but we always watching the economy and will adjust policy as appropriate. Now, as I said, the hurdle to changing our plans with respect to the balance sheet, in some sense, is high.  If conditions were to weaken, we would really only consider resuming reinvestment if it were what we refer to as a material deterioration, and I tried to explain why that is.  But, you know, we will adjust monetary policy.  What you see in the dot plot is each participant’s best guess, based on the information they have today, about what will be appropriate in light of their expectations about how the economy would evolve.  And we think it’s helpful to show the public some sense that it helps in understanding our evaluation of the economy.  But we’re assessing incoming data, and these plans are subject to change.  What’s not subject to change is our commitment to doing everything in our power to achieve the goals that Congress has assigned to us, which are price stability or 2 percent inflation and maximum employment. respond to an economic downturn? 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Do you, in fact, have room in the next two or three years to 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, certainly, if growth is stronger or if inflation picks up more rapidly, we have room.  We have a certain amount of room now, and we have raised the funds September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL rate four times.  We believe that we are on a path where there will likely be further increases over the next couple of years, which will give us greater room, and we think the recovery is on a strong track.  So the reason for our actions today in beginning to run down the balance sheet is, we think the economy is performing well and we have confidence in the outlook for the real economy.  But, of course, there are shocks, and if the negative shock to the economy were sufficient, we recognize that we might be unable to pursue objectives purely by cutting the federal funds rate, and that is why we say explicitly that we would be prepared, in that event, to resume reinvestment, and other tools that we used in the financial crisis—forward guidance—would also be available to us. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Yellen, Fed Governor Lael Brainard recently gave a speech in which she said trend inflation appeared to have moved lower by around ½ percentage point.  I wanted to ask, do you agree?  And what would the Fed need to do, if anything, to boost trend inflation if it has fallen?  And, related to that, you’ve said you expect the inflation softness this year to prove “transitory.”  Compared to three months ago, how firm is your current expectation that the slowdown will remain transitory, and what implications would that have for monetary policy if it is not? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So the term “trend inflation”—usually there are a variety of statistical techniques that can be used to extract a trend from a series.  Exactly what that means is, in some sense, a statistical thing, and there are methodologies that would show some modest decline in recent years in the trend.  After all, we’ve had a number of years in which inflation has been low.  As I said in answer to an earlier question, I think if you go back to, say, 2013 and consider the—until this year, the reasons why inflation was low are not hard to understand.  It’s a combination September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL of slack in the labor market, declines in energy prices, and a strong dollar that pulled down import price inflation. So what’s important in determining inflation going forward is inflation expectations.  By some—by many—by some survey measures of professional forecasters, those have been rock solid.  We do also look at household expectations, which have come down some.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation, as we mentioned in the statement—they have declined, and they’ve been stable in recent months, but they’ve declined to levels that are low by historical standards.  That might suggest that inflation expectations have come down, but one can’t get a clear read—there are risk premia built into inflation compensation that make it impossible to extract directly what inflation expectations are. So, you know, there is a miss this year.  I can’t say I can easily point to a sufficient set of factors that explain this year why inflation has been this low.  I’ve mentioned a few idiosyncratic things, but, frankly, the low inflation is more broad based than just idiosyncratic things.  The fact that inflation is unusually low this year does not mean that that’s going to continue.  Remember that in January and February, core inflation was running over a 12-month basis at around 1.9 percent, and we look to be very close to 2 now.  We’ve had several months of data that have meaningfully pulled that down, and what we need to do is figure out whether or not the factors that have lowered inflation are likely to prove persistent or they’re likely to prove transitory, and that’s what we’re going to try to be determining on the basis of incoming data. And you asked me about the policy implications.  Of course, if we determined our view changed, and instead of thinking that the factors holding inflation down were transitory, we came to the view that they would be persistent, it would require an alteration in monetary policy to move inflation back up to 2 percent, and we would be committed to making that adjustment. September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL 

[SECTION]

ANN SAPHIR.  Hi, Ann Saphir with Reuters.  I wanted to ask you, markets seem to be pricing in still a shallower path of rate hikes than the Fed does in the SEP, and I wonder, what do you think that markets might be missing here, and, sort of, what’s your conviction about, you know, that your view is the correct one on the gradual—the pace that “gradual” means, which seems to be a little bit faster than what markets are pricing? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I’m not really going to try to explain what market participants are thinking.  I think all of us—both market and FOMC participants’ paths have come down.  Not in the last couple of quarters, but over the last several years, there’s been a growing recognition that the so-called neutral interest rate, consistent with the economy operating at maximum employment, that that rate seems to have come down, and most of the economic papers and research bearing on this topic suggest that it’s quite low. normal rate of interest, it is—this time it came down from—the median came down from 3 percent to 2.75 percent.  So that shows that even in the long run, FOMC participants, in light of incoming data, are adjusting their views.  I would say they still believe that, in real terms, that neutral rate will be rising somewhat over the next few years.  With a 2 percent inflation rate, that long-run estimate in real terms amounts to 75 basis points, which is higher than the zero or slightly positive rates now.  So that’s one factor that explains the path in the SEP.  Market participants may have lower estimates or believe that a low neutral rate may be more persistent. I mean, let me emphasize that, as I said before, there’s nothing set in stone about the policy paths that you see in the summary of projections.  There’s a great deal of uncertainty around them.  Not only is there disagreement, there’s also uncertainty, and FOMC participants have been revising their views over time, and they will continue to do so. September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL I’d also point out a couple of technical reasons why it’s difficult to compare what you see in the SEP and market-implied paths.  One is that FOMC participants are writing down what they think is the most likely, or modal, outcome for rates.  But, of course, there are downside risks.  And the mean rate, if they were asked to write that down, would take account of weighing all possible outcomes and likely would be lower than what participants are writing down as their most likely outcome.  In addition, in markets, many economists have suggested that there are term premia that can affect moving from the so-called market-implied path to the view for what the future federal funds rate path is, and if those term premia are negative, as many economists think they likely are, there’s a little bit less difference between what you see in the FOMC plot and the market-implied plot.

JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Thanks.  Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Times.  Chair Yellen, your term expires as Chair in February.  Have you had a chance to meet with or discuss your situation with President Trump yet?  And if so, what were your impressions of him and what he’s looking for from the Federal Reserve? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I have said that I intend to serve out my term as Chair, and that I’m really not going to comment on my intentions beyond that.  I will say that I have not had a further meeting with President Trump.  I met with him early in my term, and I’ve not had a further meeting with him.1

ADAM SHAPIRO.  Adam Shapiro, Fox Business.  Chair Yellen, a month ago you delivered a speech in Wyoming in which you said, “The balance of research suggests that the core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth.”  I have a two-part question based on that quote.  First,                                                  1 Chair Yellen intended to say that she met with President Trump early in his term. September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL what message do you want Congress and President Trump to hear from that statement?  And then, regarding economic growth, the accommodative process that the Fed has followed for the last 10 years has helped bring us to full employment, but economists point out that there have been people who haven’t benefited.  For instance, 52 percent of Americans own stock, 48 percent don’t—they’ve not participated in the gains in the stock market.  Housing prices—the median house price is now at a record high, and 39 million Americans, according to a Harvard study, spend more than 30 percent for housing.  So what would you say to those people about Fed policies and the impact they’ve had on their lives?

CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  So you asked me, what was the main—first, what was the main message of my speech, and I would say it’s that we put in place, since the financial crisis, a set of core reforms that have strengthened the financial system, and, in my personal view, it’s important they remain in place.  And those core reforms are more capital, higher-quality capital, more liquidity—especially in systemically important banking institutions—stress testing, and resolution plans.  And those four prongs of improvements in banking supervision have really strengthened the financial system and made it more resilient, and I believe they should stay in place. But I also tried to emphasize—and I believe that they have contributed to growth and the availability of credit.  I’ve also tried to emphasize that all regulators should be attentive to undue regulatory burden and look for ways to try to scale that back.  And this is especially true after years in which we have implemented a large number of complex regulations, and we have been committed to doing that.  I would point out particularly community banks that are laboring under significant regulatory burden.  We have been looking for ways to scale back burdens, running the 

[SECTION]

EGRPRA process, where we’ve listened to concerns among community banks and are looking September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL for ways, for example, to simplify capital standards and reduce burdens, and that’s very important. More generally, we want to tailor—we want to, and we would like to see Congress as well—we can do things to appropriately tailor regulations to the risk posed by different kinds of banking organizations.  There are some things that Congress could also do to help that process, and we have made some concrete suggestions.  And then some of the regulations that we have put in place with other regulators since the crisis, like the Volcker rule, are really quite complex, and we’re working—we believe we should—and we’re working with other regulators to try to see if we can find ways, while carrying out what Dodd-Frank intended, that banking organizations not be involved in proprietary trading.  Nevertheless, the implementation can be less complex.  So that was my main message. Your second question asked about what impact the Fed has had on income distribution because of the fact that stocks and homes tend to be disproportionately owned.  So, I would say, look, we were faced with a huge recession that took an enormous toll in terms of depriving large numbers of people—and disproportionately lower-income people who are less advantaged in the labor market—found themselves without work.  We had a 10 percent unemployment rate, and our congressional mandate is maximum employment and price stability.  So we set monetary policy not with a view toward affecting the distribution of income, but toward pursuing those congressionally mandated goals. And I am pleased to see the unemployment rate and every other measure that I know of pertaining to the labor market show dramatic improvement over these years, and that is hugely important to the economic well-being not at the top end of the wealth and income distribution, September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL but to the bottom end of the income distribution.  And we have seen this year median income in real terms rise significantly, with gains throughout the income distribution. month, with the departure of Vice Chair Fischer, the Fed’s going to lose its quorum—the Fed Board—you’ll go to three members.  Do you have—is that going to present operational challenges for you?  Do have contingency plans?  Has the Senate assured you that Mr. Quarles will be—his confirmation will be approved?  And in your discussions with the Administration, have they given you any assurances that the pace of nominations is going to pick up soon? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So first let me say that I will greatly miss Vice Chair Fischer.  He’s made enormous contributions to the FOMC and to the broader work of the Federal Reserve, and I have really enjoyed working with him and appreciated his wise counsel and friendship.  It is conceivable that we will be down to three Governors.  I have full confidence that even if that happens, we will be able to carry out our complement of responsibilities.  There’s—every action that we are allowed to take under the Federal Reserve Act can be taken, even if we are a Board of three, although we will have to abide, as we always do, by the restrictions that are part of the Government in the Sunshine Act. I would welcome a full complement of colleagues.  We have a lot of work to do, and it would be nice to distribute it over more people.  But, perhaps more important than that, I think it’s very important to have a broad range of views around the table as we deliberate on policy actions.  I’ve had very good interactions with Randy Quarles and hope he will be confirmed.  I look forward to working with him, and, you know, I hope that the Administration will make other nominations to fill our slots. September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL

HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long from the Washington Post.  As you know, Congress is considering a major tax reform package.  Do you or any of the Committee members have concerns if that package does not end up being deficit neutral and ends up adding to the debt?  Would that be problematic for the economy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Look, that’s something that’s a matter for Congress and the White House to decide.  You know, I’ve put forward a few principles about fiscal policy that I would reiterate, that one of the problems that the American economy suffers from, along with many other economies around the globe, is slow productivity growth, and I think it would be very desirable if a fiscal package had the potential in it to create incentives that would raise productivity growth.  We do face, in terms of longer-term deficits as the population ages, an unsustainable debt path that will require, I believe, some adjustments to fiscal policy, and I hope Congress will keep that in mind.  But beyond a few core principles, it’s really—I don’t want to weigh in on details.

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace.  When you testified before Congress last July, you said that you might be prepared to take enforcement actions against Wells Fargo if it proved to be appropriate.  Do you think it’s appropriate, and what actions could you take? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me say that I consider the behavior of Wells Fargo towards its customers to have been egregious and unacceptable.  We take our supervision responsibilities at the company very seriously, and we are attempting to understand what the root causes of those problems are and to address them.  I’m not able to discuss confidential supervisory information and not yet able to tell you what actions we may take, but I do want to say that we are committed September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL to taking the actions we regard as necessary and appropriate to make sure that the right set of controls are in place in that organization.

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Can you give me any kind of a timeline?

DAVID HARRISON.  Hi, thank you.  David Harrison with Dow Jones.  I’d like to follow up on the balance sheet question, if I may.  What specifically would it take for you to reverse the to the balance sheet again?  And separately, as a follow-up to that, looking more broadly, how do you think history will judge the effectiveness of your asset purchases and the conditions under which that policy should be used?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, starting with the last part of the question, I mean, my own judgment, based on my experience and the economic research that has tried to estimate the effectiveness of our balance sheet actions starting in 2008 and has also looked at the similar balance sheet actions in other parts of the world, including the euro area, is that these actions were successful in making financial conditions more accommodative and, I believe, in stimulating a faster recovery than we otherwise would have had.  A recent Fed working paper estimated that the full set of balance sheet actions that we took during the crisis may have lowered long-term interest rates by about 100 basis points.  Obviously, there are different—there are different estimates around—of what difference it made, but I would say that it’s effective. It will be up to future policymakers to decide, in the event of a severe downturn, whether they think it’s appropriate to again resort to balance sheet—to adding assets to a balance sheet.  I would say that if economists are correct that we’re living in a world where the level of neutral interest rates not only in the United States, but around the world is likely to be low in the future September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL due to slow productivity growth and demographics—now, we don’t know that that view will bear out to be correct, but it is a view that many people adhere to when there is evidence of it—then future policymakers will be faced with the question of, in the event of a severe downturn where they’re not able to provide as much stimulus as they would ideally like by cutting overnight interest rates, what other actions are available to them? And during the crisis, we bought longer-term assets and used forward guidance, and for my own part, I would want to keep those things in the toolkit as being available.  It will be up to future policymakers to decide how to rank those, or whether or not there might be other options that are available to them, but I don’t think this issue will go away, although perhaps it’s only—well, this could well be a decision that future policymakers will have to face in the event of a significant asset—economic shock. I mean, you asked me what would it take for us to resume reinvestment, and I can’t really say much more than we said in the guidance that we provided, which is that if there is a material deterioration in the economic outlook and we thought we might be faced with a situation where we would need to substantially cut the federal funds rate and could be limited by the so-called zero lower bound, it is that type of determination that our Committee is saying would—might lead us to resume reinvestment. So that’s—our Committee has been unanimous in affirming this statement of intentions, so, you know, I think that’s where our Committee stands.  So that is a somewhat high bar to resume reinvestments, and that’s why, in answering previous questions, I would say, well, you know, if there’s some small, negative shock, our first tool—our most important and reliable tool—will be the federal funds rate.  But if there is a significant shock that’s a material deterioration to the outlook, we would consider resuming reinvestment. September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Yellen.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  You’ve been on the Financial Stability Oversight Council for a few years now, and I was wondering if you had any thoughts on whether the designation process for Systemically Important Financial Institutions should be changed or improved in any way.  And a somewhat separate, but related, question:  The situation with Equifax—I was wondering if there’s anything related to that that might raise systemic issues that FSOC would need to discuss. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So you asked first about the designation process.  So during the time that I’ve been on the FSOC, only one firm was—several firms were designated before I participated.  MetLife was designated during the time that I was there, and I have seen how the designation process works. I do think designation is important.  We saw during the financial crisis that some systemically important nonbanking organizations like Lehman and AIG—that their distress produced broad systemic consequences that were adverse for the U.S. economy.  And having the ability to designate firms when the FSOC makes the determination that their distress or failure could have systemic repercussions, I believe that’s an important—that’s an important policy tool for FSOC to have available. Now, it’s not meant to be a one-way street, in the sense that a firm that’s designated—the procedures require annual reviews.  Firms may change their business models or just how they conduct their business, and we should welcome de-designation of firms if their business model is changed in a way that leads us to believe that their failure or distress would no longer be systemically important and those are decisions that we make every year. So, you know, I’m satisfied with that process so far.  GE Capital dramatically changed its business model and was de-designated, and, you know, I believe it’s a process that works.  So I September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL know that the Treasury is looking at this and may make recommendations, and if they do, I’d be, you know, glad to consider them as, you know, part of the FSOC process, but I think it’s been important and basically working. You asked about Equifax and, you know, of course that is a very serious data breach.  We would really urge consumers now to be very careful in monitoring their credit reports and financial situation.  And, through our supervision, we’re working with the banks that we supervise to make sure that they take appropriate actions with respect to their business processes in light of the fact that there could be breaches or fraudulent transactions or information that they received that they might use—for example, in credit determinations—could be contaminated by bad data.  More generally, it points to the importance of strong cybersecurity controls and attention to cybersecurity risks, which we do see as one of the most significant risks to the financial sector.  And we are very focused in our banking supervision in making sure that banks have appropriate controls in place.  And the Equifax breach, I think, highlights the importance of that. people?

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  We’ve talked a lot today about what you’re going to do and what you may do, but not necessarily about why.  With four rate increases behind you, financial conditions are looser than before you began.  And I’m wondering if that bothers you, if you’re concerned about overstimulating the economy, or if you feel inflation could break out much more quickly than we have seen, or if you feel there’s a financial stability question because stocks, bonds, and real estate are all so expensive now.  How would you explain what the Fed is doing, why the Fed is doing it, to the American September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, first of all, let me say that the decisions that we’ve made this year about rates and today about our balance sheet are ones we’ve taken because we feel the U.S. economy is performing well.  We are working down our balance sheet because we feel that’s stimulus that in some sense is no longer needed.  So the basic message here is, U.S. economic performance has been good.  The labor market has strengthened substantially.  Every measure of the labor market, whether it’s the narrow unemployment rate, the broader unemployment rate, the number of people working in part-time jobs who want full-time work, the level of job openings, the quit rate, the difficulty that firms are facing in hiring workers, the level of confidence we see in surveys about the labor market—all of that is pointing to vast and continuing improvement in the labor market. And we see sufficient strength in the economy, in terms of spending—that growth, with its ups and downs, but nevertheless is strong enough—looks to be strong enough in the medium term to support ongoing improvement in the labor market.  And all of that is good, and I think that the American people should feel the steps we’re taking to normalize monetary policy are ones that we feel are well justified, given the very substantial progress we’ve seen in the economy. Now, inflation is running below where we want it to be, and we’ve talked about that a lot during this—the last hour.  This past year, where it’s not clear what the reasons are—I think it’s not been mysterious in the past, but, one way or another, we have had four or five years in which inflation is running below our 2 percent objective, and we are also committed to achieving that.  So the monetary policy path that we follow and the paths that my colleagues are writing down in our projections as ones they think will be appropriate given economic conditions are ones that September 20, 2017 Chair Yellen’s PressConference FINAL we think are necessary to move inflation back up to 2 percent and to maintain a strong labor And in making these judgments about the path of policy, we have to balance various risks.  One risk is that if we tighten policy too quickly, we may find out that, although we don’t think this now, that the inflation shortfall is something that’s going to be persistent.  And if we tighten too quickly, we could undermine inflation performance—leave it at too low a level—inflation expectations could fall, and that could become ingrained, and that would be dangerous.  And so that’s a reason to be cautious about raising interest rates when inflation is as low as it is. But, on the other hand, we have a strong labor market and a low unemployment rate.  And although the pace of job gains is not quite as strong this year as, for example, as it was in 2016, we’re still averaging 175,000 jobs a month this year, which is quite a bit above the pace of participation begins to move down in the manner we expect. So if we don’t do anything to remove policy accommodation, and the labor market tightens and just continues to tighten, as you mentioned, arguably—we could, you know—arguably, financial conditions overall haven’t tightened that much.  We think the economy could overheat, inflation could rise more quickly and above our objective.  That’s something that would occur with a lag, and that would force us later on to tighten policy more rapidly than would be ideal, and we could risk a recession if we did that. So there are risks on both sides to our objectives, and most of my colleagues and I have concluded that a gradual path of rate increases—while constantly watching incoming data, being open to revising our views on the outlook, and revising our expectations about policy—is the best way to manage that set of risks. ",Janet Yellen,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
19,2017-12-13,"CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  Today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1¼ to 1½ percent.  Our decision reflects our assessment that a gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation will sustain a strong labor market while fostering a return of inflation to 2 percent, consistent with the maximum employment and price stability objectives assigned to us by law.  Before saying more about our decision, I’ll review recent economic developments and the outlook. Following a slowdown in the first quarter, economic growth stepped up to a solid 3¼ percent pace in the second and third quarters of the year.  Household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, business investment has picked up, and favorable economic conditions abroad have supported exports.  Overall, we continue to expect that the economy will expand at a moderate pace.  While changes in tax policy will likely provide some lift to economic activity in coming years, the magnitude and timing of the macroeconomic effects of any tax package remain uncertain. Smoothing through hurricane-related fluctuations, job gains averaged 170,000 per month over the three months ending in November, well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force.  The unemployment rate has declined further in recent months and, at 4.1 percent in November, was modestly below the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level.  Broader measures of labor market utilization have also continued to strengthen.  Participation in the labor force has changed little, on net, over the past four years.  Given the underlying downward trend in participation stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population, a relatively steady participation rate is a further sign of improved  December 13, 2017  conditions in the labor market.  We expect that the job market will remain strong in the years Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL ahead. expansion. You may have noticed that we altered the statement language about the labor market outlook.  This change highlights that the Committee expects the labor market to remain strong, with sustained job creation, ample opportunities for workers, and rising wages.  We anticipate some further strengthening in labor market conditions in the months ahead; however, we expect the pace of job gains to moderate over time as we gradually reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation.  Allowing the labor market to overheat would raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly at a later stage, jeopardizing the economic Even with a firming of economic growth and a stronger labor market, inflation has continued to run below the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run objective.  The 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures was 1.6 percent in October, up a bit from the summer but still below rates seen earlier in the year.  Core inflation—which excludes the volatile food and energy categories—has followed a similar pattern and was 1.4 percent in October.  We continue to believe that this year’s surprising softness in inflation primarily reflects transitory developments that are largely unrelated to broader economic conditions.  As a result, we still expect inflation will move up and stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years.  Nonetheless, as I’ve noted previously, our understanding of the forces driving inflation is imperfect.  As emphasized in our statement, we will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to our symmetric inflation goal.  And, as I’ve noted before, we are prepared to adjust monetary policy as needed to achieve our inflation and employment objectives over the medium term.  December 13, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL Let me turn to the economic projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting.  As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depend on each participant’s assessment of the many factors that shape the outlook.  The median projection for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, or real GDP, is 2½ percent this year and next and moderates to 2 percent by 2020, a bit above its estimated longer-run rate.  The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs close to 4 percent over the next three years, modestly below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate.  Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.7 percent this year, 1.9 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2019 and 2020.  Compared with the projections made in September, real GDP growth is a little stronger, the unemployment rate is a bit lower, and inflation is essentially unchanged.  Participants generally identified changes in tax policy as a factor supporting this modestly stronger outlook, although many noted that much uncertainty remains about the macroeconomic effects of the specific measures that ultimately may be implemented. Returning to monetary policy, for the past two years the FOMC has been gradually increasing its target range for the federal funds rate as the economy has continued to make progress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability.  Our decision today continues this process. We still expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate.  That expectation is based on our view that this rate remains somewhat below its neutral level—that is, the level that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel.  Because the neutral rate currently appears to be quite low by historical standards, the federal funds rate would not have to rise much further to  December 13, 2017  get to a neutral policy stance.  But because we also expect the neutral level of the federal funds Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL rate to rise somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain a strong labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective.  Even so, the Committee continues to anticipate that the longer-run neutral level of the federal funds rate is likely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades. This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.  The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.1 percent at the end of next year, 2.7 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.1 percent in 2020.  Compared with the projections made in September, the median path for the federal funds rate is unchanged through 2019 and a touch higher in 2020. I should note that the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate as their economic outlooks and views of the risks to the outlook change.  Policy is not on a preset course. Additionally, the Committee’s balance sheet normalization program, initiated in October, is proceeding.  As we’ve noted previously, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy, and we do not foresee a need to alter our balance sheet normalization program.  Hence, our statement no longer mentions this program.  Of course, we would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a material deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds rate. Finally, I’d like to note that, although I have one more FOMC meeting to attend in the New Year, this will be my last scheduled news conference.  Over the next month and a half, I will do my utmost to ensure a smooth transition to my designated successor, Jay Powell.  I am confident that he is as deeply committed as I have been to the Federal Reserve’s vital public  December 13, 2017  mission.  Thank you for being such an attentive audience these past four years.  And, as always, Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL I’ll be happy to take your questions. could you give us any insight into the discussion and how it dealt with the major tax changes that Congress is considering now?  There have been thoughts that with these changes happening at a time when the economy is already—with unemployment so low—that the Fed may be forced to increase its pace on rate hikes.  Did any of that discussion come up in your meeting? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, yes, we did discuss tax policy, and let me say that most of my colleagues factored in the prospect of fiscal stimulus along the lines of what’s being contemplated by Congress into their projections.  Now, I should emphasize that some have been incorporating those expectations into their projections throughout the year, so changes to the projections that you see since September should not be viewed as an impact—an estimate of the impact of the tax package.  And, in particular, broader expectations of changes to fiscal policy have been reflected in financial market conditions, I think, over the past year.  For example, we have seen a significant increase in the stock market, and at least some portion of that, I would judge, likely partly reflected expected tax changes, and that effect—along with other financial affected wealth—that’s been part of participants’ forecasts now for some time.  I think my colleagues and I are in line with the general expectation among most economists that the type of tax changes that are likely to be enacted would tend to provide some modest lift to GDP growth in the coming years, and you see that—in part, that’s one of the reasons, I think, for the uptick you see in estimated growth and decline in the unemployment rate.  December 13, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL The views of participants, I believe, have been informed by a wide range of analysis, including that of the Joint Committee on Taxation and other outside evaluators, and my sense is that their estimates are essentially in the same ballpark, although they recognize, as I emphasized, that there is considerable uncertainty about the impacts, and that will have to be monitored over time.  More specifically, they tend to see the package as boosting both consumer spending and capital spending, to some extent. Now, to the extent that the changes do have positive impact on the growth of potential GDP and longer-run growth, let me just say that this is something that, should it occur, would be very welcome to participants, as long as it’s consistent with the attainment of our employment and inflation objectives.  I guess I would also urge you to remember that when you look at the projections, that there are many factors that affect those projections, and changes in tax policy—that’s only one of a number of factors, including incoming data that has, to some extent, altered the outlook for growth and inflation.  All of that factors into the projections you see. But I think, bottom line, when you look at assessments of the funds rate path, participants continue to see gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate as being appropriate to sustain a strong labor market and bring inflation back to 2 percent.  And, look—importantly, there is a lot of uncertainty about what the likely effects will be, and my colleagues and I will be committed, as always, to evaluating incoming data and altering the outlook as appropriate. 

[SECTION]

HARRIET TORRY.  Harriet Torry with Dow Jones Newswires.  You and others at the Fed have said that soft inflation should be transitory.  Are you confident that that will still be the case, particularly regarding wage gains?  They’ve been pretty moderate in recent months, yet the  December 13, 2017  economy is growing and confidence is high.  Is there something going on in the economy that’s Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL making it difficult for businesses to raise wages? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So it is true that incoming wage data suggests only modest upward pressure on wages.  That leaves me—that’s one factor, along with the fact that inflation remains low—with feeling that even though we have a 4.1 percent unemployment rate, that the labor reflects slow productivity growth.  But when you ask me about the outlook for inflation, you know, I’ve talked in detail about this in the past and recognize that there is uncertainty about what’s holding inflation down.  But my colleagues and I continue to believe that the factors that are responsible this year for holding inflation down are likely to prove transitory.  That said, we all agree that our inflation objective is extremely important.  We recognize that there’s been a prolonged shortfall.  This is a symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, and we continue to indicate that we’ll be monitoring inflation developments closely.  And so this is on the horizon and recognized to be one of the risks facing policy. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Yellen, I wanted to follow up on the question about tax changes.  When you addressed it earlier today, and when you spoke to Congress last month, you often describe that you would welcome higher growth in the context of the employment and inflation mandate.  And I guess I wonder how you judge the major provisions of the House and Senate tax plans:  the corporate rate cut, immediate expensing of big-ticket purchases, new rates for pass-throughs, temporary rate cuts for individuals.  Do you see those, on balance, boosting the productive capacity of the U.S. economy as opposed to simply increasing aggregate demand?  And, related to that, how would you view  December 13, 2017  the benefit of such tax changes now, when the economy is nearing full employment, versus at Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL earlier periods when there was greater resource slack? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I think my colleagues and I mainly see the likely tax package as boosting aggregate demand, but also having some potential to boost aggregate supply.  So changes on the corporate tax side—the reduction in the corporate tax rate, expensing—will lower the cost of capital.  And while there are a range of estimates and uncertainty about how much stimulus that will provide to investment, in general I would see some stimulus to investment. In terms of aggregate supply effects, a stronger pace of investment could boost capital formation and thereby raise productivity growth and potential GDP or output to some extent.  Exactly how large those effects might be remain uncertain, but that is a channel.  And I suppose it’s also possible—I’m uncertain how significant this would be—that lower marginal effective tax rates for those groups that will see them could boost labor supply.  And, again, there are a range of estimates in the literatures. I indicated I think participants have reviewed a number of pieces of analysis, including the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, and the many outside analysts who have weighed in on this and been influenced by that kind of analysis—but there is a good deal of uncertainty about what the impacts would be.  And, to the extent that there are larger impacts than those analyses assume on aggregate supply or potential GDP, in the context of an economy that has had disturbingly low productivity growth, that would be welcome and could support faster GDP growth, at least for some period, without—you know, without creating a need to tighten monetary policy to offset that. So there are potentially both demand and supply effects here.  So, importantly, you really don’t, at the end of the day, see very much change in the federal funds rate path.  Participants do  December 13, 2017  recognize that the unemployment rate is lower than their estimates of its long-run sustainable Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL rate, so I think we are in the vicinity of full employment. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long from the Washington Post.  You have mentioned that the Committee thinks there will be wage increases next year.  I’m wondering if you could clarify if that is coming in part or mostly from the changes to the tax plan.  Is that what the expectation is, would drive the wage increases?  And I was also wondering, I’ve heard from so many female economists in academia and at the Fed about what an inspiration you’ve been to them and how melancholy they will be to see you go.  I was wondering if you just had any final words to young females and minorities who may be looking to enter economics or a banking profession and rise

HEATHER LONG.  Wages. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Wages, yes. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Is the tax policy driving wage increase expectations? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think, generally, in a strong labor market where many firms are having difficulty finding qualified workers, we would expect, just through normal demand and supply channels, to see some upward pressure on wage growth over time.  And as the labor remains at a low level, but I would expect, in the context of an ongoing strong labor market, to see some upward pressure.  And I believe that’s the main thing that my colleagues are factoring in. On your question on advice to women and minorities, in the Federal Reserve, my colleagues and I are very focused on wanting to see and do what we can to foster greater  December 13, 2017  participation of women and minorities in economics.  We would love to, if we could, increase Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL our hiring ourselves of women and minorities, and we see that both women and minorities are studying economics in disproportionately and disturbingly low numbers.  Although the women in STEM fields generally are about even with men—represent about 50 percent—in economics, women majors constitute something like 30 percent of undergraduate majors, and there is disproportionate low enrollment of minorities. I will just say, from my own experience, I think economics is a terrific field.  I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my career in economics and think there are many different paths that people can follow that lead to satisfying careers, and that there are very interesting and important questions that economics addresses.  And it is a great field, and I would like to encourage greater involvement and think that people will find that satisfying.  And, just in terms of the kinds of research that’s done in the field, I think also a greater diversity, more women and minorities, analysis that they bring and a range of thinking that bears on research.  And all of that would be a healthy development.

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Every day, it seems, we look at the stock Federal Reserve about current market valuations, and do they now or should they, do you think, if we keep going on this trajectory—should that animate monetary policy?  Finally, maybe as a sign of what’s been going on with valuations, this cryptocurrency called bitcoin keeps going up every day.  What is the policy of the central bank of the United States of the introduction, use, and incredible rise in popularity of bitcoin?  December 13, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  So let me start, Steve, with the stock market generally.  I mean, of course the stock market has gone up a great deal this year, and we have in recent months characterized the general level of asset valuations as “elevated.”  What that reflects is simply the assessment that, looking at price/earnings ratios and comparable metrics for other assets other than equities, we see ratios that are at the high end of historical ranges—and so that’s worth pointing out.  But economists are not great at knowing what appropriate valuations are.  We don’t have a terrific record, and the fact that those valuations are high doesn’t mean that they are necessarily overvalued. We are in a—I’ve mentioned this in my opening statement, and we’ve talked about this repeatedly—likely a low interest rate environment, lower than we’ve had in past decades.  And if that turns out to be the case, that’s a factor that supports higher valuations.  We’re enjoying solid economic growth with low inflation, and the risks in the global economy look more balanced than they have in many years.  So I think what we need to and are trying to think through is, if there were an adjustment in asset valuations or the stock market, what impact would that have on the economy, and would it provoke financial stability concerns?  And I think when we look at other indicators of financial stability risks, there’s nothing flashing red there or possibly even orange.  We have a much more resilient, stronger banking system, and we’re not seeing some worrisome buildup in leverage or credit growth at successive levels.1  So, you know, this is something that the FOMC pays attention to, but if you ask me, is this a significant factor shaping monetary policy now, well, it’s on the list of risks, it’s not a major—it’s not a major factor. And then you asked about bitcoin, and there I would simply say that bitcoin at this time plays a very small role in the payment system.  It is not a stable source of—store of value, and it                                                  1 Chair Yellen intended to say that credit growth is not at excessive levels.  December 13, 2017  doesn’t constitute legal tender.  It is a highly speculative asset, and the Fed doesn’t really play Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL any role—any regulatory role with respect to bitcoin other than assuring that banking organizations that we do supervise are attentive, that they’re appropriately managing any interactions they have with participants in that market and appropriately monitoring anti-money-laundering Bank Secrecy Act, you know, responsibilities that they have. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Has there been a directive, or, more importantly, has there been a directive about bitcoin to the banks and their dealings with bitcoin from the Federal Reserve? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  I don’t believe there’s been anything specific about that, just, generally, banks have Bank Secrecy Act anti-money-laundering responsibilities, and this applies to bitcoin as it does in every other realm. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Hi, Chair Yellen, Donna Borak with CNN.  To return back to the prospective tax bill questions, in your view at all, is the Republican tax bill an ill-timed fiscal stimulus, and are you concerned at all it will wind up squandering the tools both the Congress and the Fed have when it comes time to dealing with a recession? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, look, I will just say that it is up to the Administration and Congress to decide on appropriate fiscal policy, and our job is to maintain our focus on employment and inflation.  We continue to think, as you can see from the projections, that a gradual path of rate increases remains appropriate even with almost all participants now factoring in their assessment of the impact of the tax—the tax policy. You know, it is projected that the tax cut package will lead to additions to the national debt and boost, by the end of the horizon, the debt-to-GDP ratio.  And I will say—and this is nothing new, this is something I’ve been saying for a long time—I am personally concerned about the U.S. debt situation.  It’s not that the debt-to-GDP ratio at the moment is extraordinarily  December 13, 2017  or worrisomely high, but it’s also not very low.  And it’s projected, as the population continues Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL to age and the baby boomers retire, that that ratio will continue to rise in an unsustainable fashion.  So the addition to the debt, taking what is already a significant problem and making it worse, is—it is of concern to me, and I think it does suggest that in some future downturn, which, well, could occur just for whatever reason, the amount of fiscal space that would exist for fiscal policy to play an active role, it will be limited—may well be limited. 

[SECTION]

SAM FLEMING.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.  A couple of longer-term questions.  First of all, midway through the year you talked about the issue of whether inflation targets might need to be raised.  There’s obviously been a lot more debate in the Fed’s system since then about this.  It may not be an imminent issue, but do you expect it to be something the Fed should be discussing over the coming years as some sort of change to the inflation target?  Second of all, the amount of stimulus tools that the Fed may have at its disposal when the next downturn strikes are fairly limited.  One of the incoming governors, Marvin Goodfriend, has talked about the merits of negative interest rates.  I just wondered whether you see that as a potential—or at least in theory, for the Fed to consider should it run out of other options.  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So right now the FOMC is not discussing or considering its inflation target.  We do see inflation as likely moving up to target over the next couple of years, and I would say—you said our stimulus tools are limited.  I would want to emphasize that if there were a negative shock to the economy, we do have some scope to cut the fed funds rate, and there are other tools available, ones that we have used previously:  forward guidance and asset purchases.  So I think we’re not—I wouldn’t say that we’re out of ammunition, but certainly it’s been recognized—and I’ve emphasized myself that, in the longer run, we may be—and we’ll have to  December 13, 2017  see how this works out, but we may be in low interest rate environments where it could prove Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL useful to have additional scope to conduct monetary policy.  And, in that context, I think additional research—the academic economists and others are thinking hard about what more could be done, and I think these are matters that are certainly worthy of further study. 

[SECTION]

SAM FLEMING.  So you do believe that negative interest rates, at least in theory, are possible in the U.S. at some point if it should be necessary—at least in theory. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, I mean, on that I would say we have—that’s not something that we have studied inside the Fed to any considerable extent and haven’t seriously thought about using ourselves during this last downturn and recovery.  We have watched what’s happened in other countries.  I think that’s worthwhile.  And I would say it’s an area that academics may have interest in in the future and is worthy of some study, but it hasn’t been part of the Fed’s agenda. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Yellen.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  I just wanted to ask you quickly, on the regulatory side, in your testimony to Congress recently you spoke positively about the Senate bank regulatory reform bill, and I was wondering if there are—beyond that bill—if there are tweaks to Dodd-Frank that you think might still be beneficial.  And then, somewhat related, Governor Powell recently said that there are currently no U.S. banks that are too big to fail.  And I was wondering, do you agree with that assessment? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I mean, you know, I think I’m not familiar with every detail of the bill, but I think the bill does address a wide range of issues that, you know, we’ve highlighted in the past as being ones where perhaps additional flexibility to tailor our supervisory requirements would be worthwhile.  So I don’t have additional things on the congressional list.  Sorry, and what—the other thing— 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Too big to fail.  December 13, 2017  

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Oh, too big to fail. Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Are there any banks that are too big to fail right now? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, you know, we continue to work seriously on resolution and the resolution plans, the living wills, and the structure of systemic firms to ensure that it would be possible to resolve a firm—under the bankruptcy code would be the top choice of methods, or, alternatively, under the Orderly Liquidation Authority.  And I think it’s fair to say that, over time, we have learned more ourselves and more clearly detailed our expectations for the firms that file living wills.  And the firms themselves have made considerable progress in, you know, changing what they do, whether it’s adopting financial contracts that would facilitate a resolution rather than a disorderly unwinding of contracts, making sure that they’re appropriately dealing with shared services so that key services would be able to continue, governance arrangements, legal entity structures—the firms have all made progress in adapting to our expectations of what would enable a successful resolution.  So I think it’s an ongoing process, and I believe we have made substantial progress. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.  I’m struggling to reconcile the pieces of the economic outlook that you’ve described today.  You’ve said that we are basically at full employment.  You’ve said that you’re expecting a tax package to deliver a significant stimulus, and that it will be on the demand side.  You expect growth to be faster.  You expect unemployment to be lower, and yet somehow inflation is going to remain at 2 percent for the foreseeable future.  Could you describe what has changed about your economic assessment so that everything has changed except inflation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, you know, the projections that we’re showing you today, many factors went into that, fiscal policy being one of a number of different factors.  And, you know,  December 13, 2017  you’re looking at 16 participants who have made adjustments to their economic outlook for a Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL whole variety of reasons, including, in some cases, rethinking some of the fundamentals that went into their original forecast.  So there have been modifications in different directions by different participants.   So I would caution you about the dangers of looking at the median and acting like that is one individual who has made a change to their forecast.  That’s a leap that isn’t quite justified. But, look, generally, you see modestly faster growth over the next couple of years, which is consistent and, I said, I think for most participants, reflects partly an impact from taxes stimulating consumer and investment spending.  But it’s not a gigantic increase in growth that since—relative to September. You do see a lower path for unemployment, but remember that inflation has also been running low on a persistent basis, and the Committee does have a concern about inflation and wants to see it moving up.  And, on balance, you see only modest changes, slight revisions to the path for the fed funds rate.  You might think, well, shouldn’t I see more?  Well, okay, growth is a little stronger, the unemployment rate runs a little bit lower—that would perhaps push in the direction of slightly tighter monetary policy.  But, again, counterbalancing that is that inflation has run lower than we expect, and, you know, it could take a longer period of a very strong labor 

[SECTION]

JUSTINE UNDERHILL.  Justine Underhill, Yahoo Finance.  So William Dudley of the New York Fed recently said that the Fed is exploring the idea of potentially having its own cryptocurrency or digital currency.  What use do you see a cryptocurrency could have for the Fed, and do you see the potential of a cryptocurrency that might be considered legal tender?  December 13, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I want to distinguish carefully between digital currency and cryptocurrency.  This is—there is a discussion going on among central bankers about the potential merits of adopting—a central bank itself adopting a digital currency.  And there might even be a central banker or two around the globe that might go in that direction.  But I really want to caution that this is not something the Federal Reserve is seriously considering at this stage while we’re looking at research on this topic.  There are, I think, to my mind, limited benefits from introducing it, a limited need for it, and some substantial concerns.  And so I would really doubt that the Federal Reserve would soon go in that direction.  But it is something that central banks are looking at to see if there could be benefits from doing it. 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Chair Yellen, before I ask this question, thanks for your stewardship of the economy, the benefits of which I’ve seen in some of the harder-hit parts of my own family, so— 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Your tenure.  We’ve seen six Federal Reserve presidents appointed.  One was a woman and five are men, so I’d like to know how that comports with your commitment to gender diversity.  And, second, I wonder if you think this process of appointing Reserve Bank presidents needs to be more transparent and accountable.  Recently, the Richmond Fed board took 11 months, and they came up with a candidate who was another Fed board member.  And so I’m wondering what you would say to critics who say that looks like cronyism, and if you think, you know, this could be simply a more open process.  These are votes on national monetary policy, after all. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I would agree with you that these are important appointments.  Under the Federal Reserve Act, the nonbanking directors of the Reserve Banks have  December 13, 2017  responsibility for conducting a search, and the Board of Governors has to sign off on the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL candidates.  We’ve made very clear and we monitor ongoing searches very carefully to make sure that absolutely every effort is made to create a pool that is diverse, and that there be a national search, and that every attempt should be made to create a diverse pool.  At the end of the day, we cannot guarantee that the outcomes of these searches will result in an increase in diversity.  I mean, I’ve been very pleased to see that there’s been some success in that regard, but we have signed off on the individuals who were appointed and have held the view that these are individuals who were qualified to serve in these positions.  So I would hope—I would hope to see greater diversity.  It has been a challenge to achieve that. 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Should the process be more open somehow? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think the process has become more open, and in a number of the recent searches there has been outreach—public outreach, information on websites, acceptance of potential names and nominees, and those have gotten careful consideration.  There has been—there have been meetings in some cases with community groups to try to enlarge the pool and get suggestions, and I think that’s appropriate, and I think it has moved in the direction you’re suggesting. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  I’m wondering if you have any advice for incoming Chair Powell? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, my colleague—I’ve had the pleasure of working with him now for many years, and he is somebody who understands the Federal Reserve very well and shares its values.  And as I mentioned in my opening statement, he is committed to the mission of the Fed; to its independence; and to its acting in a nonpartisan, nonpolitical way.  He is somebody who has participated in the FOMC now for many years.  To the best of my knowledge, he has  December 13, 2017  been part of the consensus.  I don’t believe he’s ever dissented.  I think there is strong consensus Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL in the Committee for the gradual approach that we have been pursuing, and Governor Powell has been part of that consensus, so I feel he’s very well positioned and very knowledgeable of all the ins and outs of everything that the Fed does.  In supervision, in the payment system—he’s played an active role there—and in monetary policy, and I have confidence that he is very capable of steering the Federal Reserve in the years ahead. 

[SECTION]

JOHN HELTMAN.  Do you mean me, or—as long as everyone gets a turn.  This is John Heltman with the American Banker.  Sort of a related question to what Nancy was asking—there have been some reservations among some Democratic senators recently during Governor Powell’s confirmation hearing and during the markup of the reg relief bill about the approach towards regulation that the new leadership appears to be adopting.  Do you have any similar reservations about the new leadership’s ability to deregulate in an evenhanded way that keeps an eye towards the stability of the financial system and the—sort of, the advances that have come from post-crisis regulation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I would say that all of my colleagues on the Board have expressed a strong commitment to keep in place the core reforms that have produced a stronger financial system.  And I’m considering there stronger capital, particularly for the most systemic institutions—higher-quality capital, stronger liquidity requirements, a rigorous stress-testing program, and resolution planning that will make it more possible to resolve a firm that encounters significant distress. So I have heard broad-based commitment to those things, and I think they are the core of the reforms we have put in place.  I think all of us agree that it is appropriate to tailor regulatory requirements in all of those areas and others to the systemic footprint of firms.  We have done a  December 13, 2017  lot to do that, and I think there is more that could be done, and in some areas it would require Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL legislation in order to do that.  But I believe all of my colleagues and I are in agreement on that, and we’re also focused on community banks and want to find ways to relieve burdens.  So in those important ways, I do think that all of my colleagues are in the same place with respect to their priorities. your vision on regulatory reform? as a significant difference. 

[SECTION]

JOHN HELTMAN.  Are there any important differences between your colleagues and 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So I have not seen anything emerge at this point that I would describe 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters.  So you mentioned in response to Steve’s question that asset valuations, you didn’t think, were on the sort of high-priority risk list right now.  So I’m wondering, what do you think is on that risk list?  And, more broadly, what have you left undone?  You’ve gotten high marks for bringing the economy back towards its goals, but are there things that are going to nag you when you walk out of here in interest rates.  We’re not doing inflation framework.  What’s at your top of—what’s at the top of the to-do list that you are not getting to see to bring to ground here? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So you asked about the risk list.  There are always risks that affect the outlook.  We tend to focus in our own evaluation on economic risks, and we’ve characterized them as “balanced.”  And I think they are balanced.  You know, I can always give you a list of, you know, potential troubles, international developments that could result in downside economic risk.  But, look, at the moment the U.S. economy is performing well.  The growth that we’re seeing, it’s not based on, for example, an unsustainable buildup of debt as we had in the run-up  December 13, 2017  to the financial crisis.  The global economy is doing well.  We’re in a synchronized expansion.  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL This is the first time in many years that we’ve seen this.  Inflation around the world is generally low.  So I think the risks are balanced, and there’s less to lose sleep about now than has been true for quite some time, so I feel good about the economic out—the economic outlook. I feel, you know, good that the labor market is in a very much stronger place than it was eight years ago.  We have created 17 million jobs.  We’ve got a good, strong labor market and a very low unemployment rate, and I think that’s been tremendously important to the well-being of American households and workers.  And I feel very pleased when I hear anecdotes from firms that tell me they’re having a hard time finding workers, and they talk about, given that they’re taking on people with skills that don’t quite match what they want, but they’re training them, and, you know, giving them the training that they need in order to be able to fill jobs.  I think that’s a development that is a natural one that occurs in a strong labor market that tends to build human capital and worker skills, and that that’s a strong positive. As I mentioned, I think the financial system is on much sounder footing, and that we have done a great deal to put in place greater capital, liquidity, and so forth that make it less crisis prone, and that has been an important objective. What’s on my “undone” list, you ask?  We have a 2 percent symmetric inflation objective, and, for a number of years now, inflation has been running under 2 percent.  And I consider it an important priority to make sure that inflation doesn’t chronically undershoot our 2 percent objective, and I want to see it move up to 2 percent.  So most of my colleagues and I do believe that it’s being held down by transitory factors, but there’s work undone there, in the sense—we need to see it move up in line with our objective.  December 13, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  Chair Yellen, what do you think will be the drivers of inflation over the next couple of years, and how long will the Committee go with low unemployment, low inflation before you rethink monetary policy—this gradual rate hikes?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, you know, I think for a number of years—so we’ve had an undershoot of inflation for a number of years.  We absolutely recognize that.  I think until this year, undershoot was understandable.  First we had a good deal of slack in the labor market.  Then we had plummeting oil prices.  And, beginning in mid-2014, there was a marked depreciation in the dollar.2  And those three factors held down inflation for a number of years.   Now, in 2016, core inflation came very close to 2 percent.  We seemed to be on a path of inflation moving up, and this year, beginning in March, there seemed to be a sequence of negative surprises.  Some reflect one-time factors that were easily identifiable, like a marked name, but we would judge—you know, inflation doesn’t always follow exactly.  There are errors and many factors that affect it beyond the key influences of labor market slack:  exchange rates and import prices and oil prices.  Those are three big ones.  But there are other factors that affect inflation too, and our judgment at this point is that transitory factors that are unrelated to the broader macroeconomic outlook are holding inflation down. But I have tried to be straightforward in saying that this could end up being something that is more ingrained and turns out to be permanent.  It’s very important to watch it and, if necessary, rethink what’s determining inflation.  A possibility is that the longer-run sustainable                                                  2 Chair Yellen intended to say that, beginning in mid-2014, there was a marked appreciation of the dollar.  December 13, 2017  rate of unemployment is—it’s been coming down.  Estimates in the Committee have come down.  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL It’s conceivable that they need to come down even more. It’s not my judgment that inflation expectations have slipped, but that also remains a possibility that needs to be monitored.  So there are—you know, there could be a rethink of inflation.  I think it’s important to watch inflation outcomes carefully and, if we don’t see inflation moving in the manner that the Committee anticipates, to alter policy so that we do achieve our 2 percent objective.  But, at the moment, most of my colleagues and I believe we are on track to achieve it. 

[SECTION]

JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Hi, Chair Yellen.  Jim Puzzanghera with the Los Angeles Times.  I’m wondering, you mentioned this is your last news conference.  What are your plans when you step down from the Fed?  Are you going to remain in Washington?  Will you go back to Berkeley?  And, also, I’m curious if you have any disappointment that you’re not going to be continuing in this job as some of your predecessors have done. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  So, on my plans, I don’t have anything definite for you, I guess.  I have a home in Berkeley and expect to maintain it.  But I would say, my spouse is on the faculty—he’s a professor at Georgetown and would like to stay in his job, and we expect to maintain Washington as our base.  But I don’t have any definite plans. Let’s see.  And you asked me if I’m disappointed.  So let me just say that I have served in senior positions in the Federal Reserve now for quite a long time.  I became president in San Francisco in 2004, and I’ve participated in the FOMC since that time as president, as Vice Chair, and as Chair, and it’s been an immensely rewarding experience for me.  I feel very positive about what we’ve been able to accomplish and feel tremendous, you know, loyalty to the institution.  So I did make the judgment that this is the right time for me to leave, but I feel I have served in  December 13, 2017  senior positions at the Fed for a long time, and it’s really been an honor and a privilege for me to Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL have had a chance to do so. 

[SECTION]

ADAM SHAPIRO.  Adam Shapiro with Fox Business.  Glad to hear you’re staying on the East Coast.  I’m just curious, I wanted to follow up to the bitcoin questions, but—because you’ve lived through what we all experienced in 2007, 2008, and—should the Fed take a more active role in trying to identify who some of the counterparty and what the exposure is with bitcoin as a potential threat to financial stability?  Just—the best minds at the Fed can sometimes miss these kinds of threats.  Your predecessor, Mr. Bernanke, actually said in ’07 that the contagion from subprime would not affect the housing market or the economy.  So are we underestimating the potential threat from bitcoin as it runs up in value? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I certainly agree that it’s important for the Fed to attempt to understand emerging risks to financial stability and to be looking not just in the banking system but outside it for developments that could pose financial risks, and we are doing that.  And, I would say, one of the changes during my tenure is, we devoted—decided in the aftermath of the crisis that we needed to devote considerable resources to financial stability to monitor for emerging threats, and now we have at the Board a full-blown division of financial stability that’s involved in doing that. Now, when you ask about bitcoin, I still see the financial stability risks from it as limited.  Often, risks threatening financial stability arise when there’s exposure of the banking system to fluctuating asset valuations, and I really don’t see any significant exposure of our core financial institutions to threats from bitcoin if its value were to fluctuate.  I don’t see a threat to our core financial institutions.  So, undoubtedly, there are individuals who could lose a lot of money if  December 13, 2017  bitcoin were to fall in price, but I really don’t see that as creating a full-blown financial Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL stability risk. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  I suppose I should be asking you a valedictory question since it’s the last question, but I don’t think you can top what you’ve already said, so let me just do a couple of cleanup questions here.  President Trump, while you were speaking, just said that he thinks his tax plan will produce 4 percent growth.  Do you think that is possible?  Second, do you think that there is any Fed blame or complicity in the flattening of the yield curve, and are you worried that there might be some sort of policy mistake built into that that could slow the economy?  And the last question, which is a bit of a valedictory, is one that everybody on Wall Street has wanted to ask you for four years.  Since this is your last press conference, can you tell us which dot is yours?  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I can answer the last question first.  The answer is “no.”  I’ve never been willing to reveal which dot is mine, and I’m not going to change that now. So, you know, my assessment, and I think most participants’ assessments, as I said, of the impact of the tax policy on growth has been informed by work by the Joint Committee on Taxation and other analysts.  And everyone recognizes that there’s uncertainty about what the economic effects would be, and I wouldn’t want to rule anything out.  It is challenging, however, to achieve growth of the levels that you mentioned.  Look, if the package were to stimulate growth of that magnitude, let me just say again, the Federal Reserve would welcome that.  If it’s a supply-side—favorable supply-side developments that would be compatible with the attainment of our employment and inflation objectives, that’s something that would be very, very welcome.  But it would be challenging to achieve numbers like that.  December 13, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL Let’s see, I think you also then asked me about the yield curve, and—I mean, there is much discussion about yield curve inversions and whether or not a flattening yield curve could signal a recession.  Is that the brunt of your question? 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  And whether the Fed has made—if there’s a policy mistake embedded in that.

CHAIR YELLEN.  So this is something that we discussed and have looked at.  The yield curve has flattened some as we have raised short rates.  It mainly—the flattening yield curve mainly reflects higher short-term rates.  The yield curve is not currently inverted, and I would say that the current slope is well within its historical range. Now, there is a strong correlation historically between yield curve inversions and recessions, but let me emphasize that correlation is not causation, and I think that there are good reasons to think that the relationship between the slope of the yield curve and the business cycle two factors.  One is the expected average value of short rates over, say, 10 years, and the second piece of it is a so-called term premium that often reflects things like inflation—inflation risk. Typically, the term premium historically has been positive.  So when the yield curve has inverted historically, it meant that short-term rates were well above average expected short rates over the longer run.  So with the positive term premium, that’s what it means.  And typically that means that monetary policy is restrictive, sometimes quite restrictive, and some of those recessions were situations in which the Fed was consciously tightening monetary policy because inflation was high and trying to slow the economy. Well, right now the term premium is estimated to be quite low, close to zero, and that means that, structurally—and this can be true going forward—that the yield curve is likely to be  December 13, 2017  flatter than it’s been in the past.  And so it could more easily invert.  If the Fed were to even Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL move to a slightly restrictive policy stance, you could see an inversion with a zero term premium. So I think the fact the term premium is so low and the yield curve is generally flatter is an important factor to consider.  Now, I think it’s also important to realize that market participants are not expressing heightened concern about the decline of the term premium, and, when asked directly about the odds of recession, they see it as low, and I would concur with that judgment. Thanks very much.  ",Janet Yellen,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
20,2018-03-21,"CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Good afternoon.  I have a brief statement, and then I’ll be happy to respond to your questions. The job market remains strong, the economy continues to expand, and inflation appears to be moving toward the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run goal.  As you already know, we decided today to raise the target rate for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1½ to 1¾ percent.1  This decision marks another step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation—a process that has been under way for several years now. Job gains averaged 240,000 per month over the past three months, well above the pace needed in the longer run to absorb new entrants into the labor force.  The unemployment rate remained low in February at 4.1 percent, while the labor force participation rate moved higher.  Over the past four years, the participation rate has remained roughly unchanged.  That’s a sign of improvement, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on the participation rate, and we expect that the job market will remain strong. Although the growth rates of household spending and business investment appear to have moderated early this year, gains in the fourth quarter were strong and the fundamentals underpinning demand remain solid.  Indeed, the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.  Several factors are supporting the outlook:  Fiscal policy has become more stimulative, ongoing job gains are boosting incomes and confidence, foreign growth is on a firm trajectory, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative.                                                  1 Chairman Powell intended to say that the Committee had raised the target “range” for the federal funds rate. March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL Against this backdrop, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective.  Overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 1.7 percent in the 12 months ending in January.  The core price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food and is typically a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.5 percent over the same period.  However, as we have noted for some time, the shortfall of inflation from 2 percent reflects, at least partly, some unusual price declines that occurred nearly a year ago.  In coming months, as those earlier declines drop out of the calculation, inflation should move up closer to 2 percent and stabilize around that level over the medium term.  Of course, various forces will continue to affect inflation.  At times it may be above 2 percent, just as at times it may be below.  Our inflation objective is symmetric in the sense that we are trying to prevent persistent deviations from 2 percent in either direction. Based on the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting, the median projection for the growth of inflation-adjusted GDP is 2.7 percent this year, 2.4 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2020, a bit above its estimated longer-run rate.  The median projection for unemployment—for the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs at 3.6 percent over the next two years, almost a percentage point below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate.  Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.9 percent this year, 2 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2020.  Compared with the projections made in December, real GDP growth is stronger, the unemployment rate is lower, and inflation is slightly higher. As I noted earlier, today’s decision to raise the federal funds rate is another step in the process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation as the economic expansion March 21, 2018  continues.  This gradual process has been under way for more than two years, and it has Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL served—and should continue to serve—the economy well. In making our policy decisions over the next few years, we will continue to aim for inflation of 2 percent while sustaining the economic expansion and a strong labor market.  In the Committee’s view, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote these goals.  By contrast, raising rates too slowly would raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic expansion.  At the same time, we want to avoid inflation running persistently below our objective, which could leave us with less scope to counter an economic downturn in the future. Participants’ projections of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate reflect our gradual approach.  The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.1 percent at the end of this year, 2.9 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2020.  By 2020, the median federal funds rate is modestly above its estimated longer-run trend.  Most participants revised up their projections since December, although the median projection for this year did not change.  The medians for 2019 and 2020 are somewhat higher than in December. Of course, we’ll be watching how the economy evolves in the months and years ahead relative to our maximum employment and price stability objectives.  If the outlook changes, we will adjust monetary policy appropriately. Finally, I’ll note that our program for reducing our balance sheet, which began in outlook, we do not intend to alter this program.  As we’ve said, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  As always, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools if future economic conditions March 21, 2018  were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL the federal funds rate. Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions now. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman—right, the microphone.  Mr. Chairman, welcome.  Interesting changes in the forecast.  A higher growth forecast a full point above the long run, lower unemployment seven-tenths below the long run, and yet very little change in inflation.  What does that say about what you and the Committee believe about the inflation dynamic?  And how is it that, in that context, you justify three rate hikes this year—and I sense there’ll be three next year—and a full $600 billion, I guess, annual rate decline in the balance sheet?  Where's your biggest concern here?  Is it in overkill when it comes to rates or underkill? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, you’re right that the outlook did improve, as I mentioned and as you—as was in your question.  The Committee’s estimates of growth went up, the Committee’s estimates of unemployment went down, and there was a very slight increase in inflation.  And I think that reflects, essentially—if you think back to the era after the crisis, unemployment was 10 percent.  It’s now 4.1 percent.  You’ve only seen very gradual upward pressures on inflation and wages despite that very large increase.  And that suggests that the relationship between changes in slack and inflation is not so tight.  But, it has diminished, but it’s still there.  So I think when you see those small changes in unemployment, that simply reflects the, you know, the flatness of the Phillips curve, if you will. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  And your biggest concern or your biggest risk here—is it doing too much, doing too little? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, I think we’re trying to, we’re trying to be, to take the middle ground there.  So, you know, on the one hand, the risk would be that we wait too March 21, 2018  long, and then we have to raise rates quickly, and that foreshortens the expansion.  We don’t Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL want to do that.  The—on the other side, if we—if we raise rates too quickly, inflation, then, really doesn’t get sustainably up to 2 percent, and, that will hurt us going forward.  We need that, and it’s, you know, we need to make sure that inflation expectations are anchored at 2 percent.  So we’re trying to take that middle ground, and the Committee continues to believe that the middle ground consists of further gradual increases in the federal funds rate as long as the economy is broadly on this path. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks.  I’m Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, I want to ask about the symmetric inflation target—what you outlined in your remarks as preventing persistent deviations.  I want to understand what symmetry means in the context of inflation being allowed to run above the 2 percent target now that that’s part of the projection for—at least for core PCE next year.  How do you define symmetric relative to the experience of the past five years?  Would the Fed be willing to accept the type of overshoot of its target as it has seen during the undershoot?  And how high above 2 percent is too high to maintain a target that is symmetric?  Is it 2¼, 2½, 2¾?  And also, for how long? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, so as you noted, the—what we’ve said in the longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy is that we would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation either above or below.  We’ve also said—in minutes and in speeches and things like that—that that is a symmetric objective.  So, that’s how we think of it.  And, I think it’s—I wouldn’t characterize what we’ve done over the last five years as tolerating, you know, an undershoot of inflation.  We were always pushing toward 2 percent, and I think that is how we look at it.  I can’t give you an exact number.  It just, you know, it, we haven’t agreed on that.  It just is that we’re always going to be seeking 2 percent March 21, 2018  inflation.  And in doing that, we’re going to be considering, by the way, the other side of the Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL mandate.  You know, we have to balance that against the deviation of employment from—unemployment from its goal.  And—and also, just the duration of it as well. 

[SECTION]

JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Times.  Even with the extra fiscal stimulus of the tax cuts, your median growth projection is just up to 2.7 percent, and then—this year—and then drops back down to 2 percent by 2020.  Is the continued talk in Washington about tax cuts bringing growth to 3 percent or higher on a sustained basis overselling their potential impact? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, let me say what that really is.  So the Summary of Economic Projections is really a compilation of the individual rate forecasts.  The Committee made really one decision at this meeting, and that was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.  The Summary of Economic Projections is individual forecasts compiled and written down.  And, you’ve identified the median as 2.7 percent.  I would—and that’s an interesting statistic.  I would also say that the central tendency is interesting.  The full range is interesting.  So you have a range of views around the table.  One of the great benefits of our system is that we do have Reserve Banks with their own staffs and Governors with different views, and so we discuss these things.  So the Committee doesn’t vote or agree upon the medians, so you’re going to have a range of views.  That’s really all I can say—2.7 just happens to be the median for ’18, but it doesn’t really say, you know, what we think is possible. 

[SECTION]

JIM PUZZANGHERA.  But do you think you can get to 3 percent on a sustained basis? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, I would say it’s hard to say, but it would take—you know, that is well above almost all estimates, current estimates of potential long-run growth.  It March 21, 2018  would take, you know, significant increases in productivity and labor force participation to Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL get there. impact policy? 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Jeanna Smialek with Bloomberg News.  So obviously you guys reduced your NAIRU estimates slightly today, but if you continue to see job gains around 200,000 a month, primary labor participation rising slightly, pretty sustainably, you know, moderate wage increases, at what point are you guys going to start to question whether you’re actually overshooting full employment?  And, if you start to question that, how is that going to 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So I guess I’d start by saying that the natural rate of unemployment is not something that we can observe directly.  We look at a wide range of indicators on that—you know, 15 or 20 of them at least.  And also, I think we all understand that any point estimate is surrounded by very wide uncertainty bands.  So as the—as the actual unemployment rate has declined from 10 percent to 4.1 percent, the Committee’s median estimate of the natural rate of unemployment has also declined by a full percentage point.  So the Committee—and, I think, people—are generally influenced by data.  As they see unemployment going lower, they’re looking at a variety of aspects of the labor market, including wage inflation and price inflation.  So I don’t think we, we—we’re mindful of the uncertainty of that, and we’ll be looking at that.  So, as—if inflation—if unemployment does continue to go down, we’ll continue to do that.  As I mentioned earlier, there is no—there’s no sense in the data that we’re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation.  We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation, and we seem to be seeing more of that.  We’ll be alert to that.  I guess the idea—the theory would be that if you get below the sustainable rate of unemployment for a sustained March 21, 2018  period, you would see an acceleration of inflation.  So we would know that then, and we’re very Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL alert to it, but it’s not something we observe at the present. 

[SECTION]

SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from Financial Times.  You and other policymakers have talked about headwinds turning into tailwinds recently.  Does that imply that you think now a higher neutral rate of interest is operative in the U.S. economy, and how would you assess the implications for monetary policy?  And second question—this is obviously your first press conference, so it’s a little early to ask this question, but would you like to do this more often?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Longer-run values like the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemployment, the potential growth rate of the economy are pinned down by slow-moving forces over time.  So they don’t—they don’t move around very much.  So I wouldn’t expect the Committee’s, you know, predictions or projections or estimates of those values to move quickly.  They’ll move slowly.  So is it possible that the neutral rate of interest would move up because of, for example, greater fiscal expansion?  There’s literature that says that.  There’s—there are reasons that that might be the case.  In fact, it did tick up one-tenth, as you all know, in the—in the median at this time.  But it’s—I think, generally speaking, the Committee sees the neutral rate of interest as still quite low and is not—is not seeing it as having moved up and is open to the possibility that it will. 

[SECTION]

SAM FLEMING.  And press conferences? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Ah, press conferences.  So that’s something that I’m going to be carefully considering.  I have not made a decision about it.  My colleagues and I are committed to communicating as clearly as possible about what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.  I would want to think very carefully about it and make sure that no one would take more March 21, 2018  frequent press conferences as a signal of the path of policy.  And so, it is something that I’ll be Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL thinking about. 

[SECTION]

ADAM SHAPIRO.  Adam Shapiro with the Fox Business Network.  You brought up the fiscal stimulus and the impact it’s having, and I was curious, how is the change in the federal budget deficit—because the stimulus is coming with great debt—has it changed your approach to how many securities you’re going to allow to roll off the balance sheet, and is there a level of Treasury supply at which the Fed would consider adjusting its balance sheet roll-off, given how much the U.S. government’s going to have to borrow going forward?  And, then a second question, things beyond your control—the President is expected to announce new tariffs against China, and does the Committee discuss what potential impacts that could have in regards to inflation?  And do you have a timeline as to how you would respond to that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, in terms of the balance sheet, we’ve said that, you know, we carefully developed this plan.  We carefully socialized it in a series of meetings last year.  We announced it, and we said we wouldn’t change it, really, unless there were a significant downturn that required, you know, meaningful reductions in interest rates.  And I have no inclination to revisit that.  We’re going to use monetary policy as the principle tool of adjusting, you know, our policy. So, on the second question, on tariffs, a number of participants in this FOMC did bring up the issue of tariffs, and if I could summarize what came out of that, it was, first, that there’s no thought, I think, that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook.  Second thing is, I would say, is that a number of participants reported in—about their conversations with business leaders around the country and reported that trade policy has become a concern going forward for that group. March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL about the fact that the Summary of Economic Projections is based on the outlook of all the members of the FOMC.  Can you tell us anything, though, about the staff forecast and how that was impacted by the—we had a $1½ trillion tax cut, we’ve had $300 billion in increased government spending—the staff forecast that you’re working with, are those reflected—how were they impacted by that?  And how did that impact the discussions? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRIMAN POWELL.  So we look at the staff forecasts and the Board forecasts—and, by the way, there are 12 excellent Reserve Bank staffs who have their own views and do their own work—we look at those as informing the decisions of the policymakers.  So—and it’s really the policymakers’ views that we talk about in the SEP.  We don’t—we don’t, you know, talk about the staff forecast.  It’s a particular thing under—done under particular rules and circumstances.  And, really, it’s the policymakers that then take that as input and create their forecasts, which are what drive policy. increase in government stimulus that you’re—that had to have had an impact on the discussions, I would think, though. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Well, the—you’re right.  So fiscal stimulus is a, you know, a meaningful input into, you know, into the SEP and particularly in the changes over the course of last year and this year.  And individual policymakers went through, with their staffs, a range of estimates, a range of literature, and did their own thinking and came up with their own estimates and submitted those as their Summary of Economic Projections—as their projections.  Those are not the staff’s projections.  Those are our projections. March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long, Washington Post.  I—what will it take to get to four rate hikes this year?  It’s clear from the dot plot that many members do think four would be appropriate, but clearly something was holding a number of the FOMC members back.  Is it concerns about these potential trade tariffs that are going into effect?  Is it just that people want to wait and see a little longer before they raise?  Can you give us some more insight into why people didn’t go to four this time—the median—even though the economic projections look very healthy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I would go back to the thought that, you know, we made one The projections are really just individual projections that are submitted and then compiled.  And, you know, you’re mentioning the median as being, you know, three and four being close, but, you know, I think, like any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time, and they’ll change depending on the way the outlook for the economy changes.  So that’s really all I can say.  It could change up.  It could change down.  I wouldn’t want to—for now, these are the best forecasts that people could make, and, you know, it could be that if the economy’s a little bit stronger or a little bit weaker, then the path could be a little less gradual or a little more gradual. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  So it wasn’t one factor that was pulling at the heart of the discussion? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Not, no. 

[SECTION]

JIM TANKERSLEY.  Mr. Chairman, a quick follow on the trade question, and then a productivity question.  On trade, what would have to happen in policy—and, in particular, in potential retaliation from countries around the world—for trade policy to become a concern for the Committee’s outlook?  And then, the second question is, you mentioned productivity growth March 21, 2018  earlier.  What’s your current assessment of the path of productivity growth, and has anything in Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL policy—any policy change in recent months changed that assessment? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, for trade, what I mentioned is that our FOMC participants reported in that they had heard, you know, concerns, which were relatively new, about—about future trade actions, really.  And they’re seeing it as a risk-to-the-outlook kind of thing.  So—and the kind of things people are talking about would be, you know, more widespread retaliation and more widespread actions back-and-forth kind of thing.  I can’t be any more specific than that. In terms of productivity—productivity, as I’m sure you know, has been very weak since the financial crisis.  It’s averaged only about 0.5 percent a year for the last six years, I guess.  So that’s well below, you know, longer-run averages, and it would certainly be a good thing to see it move up.  It has moved up just a little bit but not, kind of, decisively. And, you know, you asked me about fiscal policy and the connection to productivity.  I think in the tax bill there’s—there are incentives for—there—a tax cut bill that allows expensing of investments should encourage additional investment that should encourage productivity.  In theory, an individual tax bill that lowers tax rates should encourage more labor force participation.  So I do think it’s very important that we have a focus on productivity in the country.  It’s not something that we can really do at the Fed, but, you know, we’re certainly hopeful that there will be supply-side effects like that from the tax bill.  I think estimates are really all over the place in terms of the amount and the timing of those. 

[SECTION]

JONATHAN SPICER.  Chairman Powell, Jonathan Spicer with Reuters.  I take your caveats on the dot plot, as it were, but I’ll ask another question.  In 2020, it shows that policymakers expect the policy rate to get up almost to 3½ percent, which is quite a ways—or, March 21, 2018  definitively, anyways—above the neutral rate.  Does that increase the risk of a Fed-induced Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL recession and decrease the risk of a soft landing?  Which is asking, in a way, about the fiscal policy.  And, as a follow-up, is that fiscal stimulus starting to lead to questions within the Fed around this narrative of secular stagnation and the economy entering a new sort of “low rates” environment?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, I would say that—remember that forecasts three years out—so, you’re right, in 2020 there’s a—I think it’s 3.4 percent is the median of the SEP dots for 2020, which is 40 basis points above the estimates of the neutral rate, which I would characterize as, you know, modestly restrictive, modestly tightening policy, but that’s three years in the future.  It’s highly uncertain.  You know, we don’t have the ability to see that far into the future, so I really wouldn’t put a lot in that.  It could make sense.  You could imagine narratives in which that would make sense, but I honestly I wouldn’t put too much on that.  Sorry, your second question was? 

[SECTION]

JONATHAN SPICER.  The second question was whether the secular stagnation narrative—whether fiscal policy is being questioned by the Fed around that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, we’ve been through many years of growth around 2 percent, and I’ve given a number of public remarks where I’ve called on, you know, the country to focus more on potential growth and productivity and labor force participation, which drive potential growth.  So, you know, I think it’s really important that we do something—do what we can as a country to increase our potential growth rate.  I would say in the bill that passed Congress, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there were elements that should encourage productivity, as I mentioned—sorry, encourage investment, which should help productivity, encourage labor force participation.  We don’t know how big those effects are going to be.  We don’t know what March 21, 2018  the timing would be.  I think, as you look around the table at the FOMC, there’s a wide range of Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL views on the amount and the timing of those.  I think all of us would agree that we hope that they will be large. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Hi.  Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires.  I have a question about the future of the mechanics of monetary policy.  I wanted to know whether you favor sticking with the system that you have now of keeping interest on excess reserves and reverse repo—the reverse repo rate to control interest rates—or do you want to shift back to the old way of doing things at some point of targeting the fed funds market?  And do you have any concern that if you do stick with the current system that, as rates rise, that you might see issues where the Fed is under—is being criticized for paying out ever larger shares of money to banks to, you know, to control interest rates that some might perceive as a subsidy to the banks that are getting this money? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sure.  Our current framework for implementing monetary policy is working very well.  We have excellent control over rates, and it’s working.  And it’s—you described it accurately.  We haven’t made a decision to keep that as our longer-run framework.  We haven’t really addressed that question.  We’ve had meetings where we’ve talked about it, and we’ve agreed that it’s working well.  But it’s—and it’s not something I see us as needing to urgently address.  I think we’re continuing to learn about this framework.  For example, one—in the long-run, the size of the balance sheet is going to depend on the public’s demand for our liabilities, including currency and reserves.  So we don’t know what the demand is for reserves in a world where you have—you know, you have regulations that require banks to hold lots of high-quality liquid assets, and reserves are one of those.  So it’s not something we’re looking at resolving in the near term. March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL You mentioned the question of interest on excess reserves, and I think it’s a little bit of a misnomer to think that there’s a subsidy there.  We pay interest on excess reserves.  We can’t pay interest on excess reserves that are—is above the general level of short-term interest rates.  So we’re paying rates that banks can get from other interest rates from other—any other investment in the short-term money markets.  In addition, remember that those liabilities—those are our liabilities.  The assets that we have on the other side are Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, which yield much higher than interest on reserves.  So, in fact, it’s not a subsidy, and it’s not a cost to the taxpayer. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Over here.  Thank you, Chairman.  Thank you very much.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Several of your colleagues recently have been speaking and expressing concern about financial imbalances and rising signs of financial imbalances.  I was wondering if you could give us your view on the asset markets.  Are—do you see any bubbles?  And do you have the tools you need, you think, to combat those?  Thank you very much. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Since the financial crisis, we’ve been monitoring financial conditions and financial stability issues very carefully, and the FOMC receives regular briefings about the staff framework and, sort of, measures of various aspects of financial—financial stability risks, and the current view of the Committee is that financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate, let’s say.  And I’ll go through a couple of pieces of that. So, if you look at the banking system, particularly the large financial institutions, you see higher capital.  You see much higher liquidity.  You see them more aware of their risks and better able to manage them with stress testing.  And if one—if something does go wrong, you’ve got—you’ve got better ability to deal with the failure of those institutions.  So, therefore, you don’t see high leverage.  You don’t see excess risk-taking in great quantity the way you did see March 21, 2018  before the crisis.  If you look at households, household balance sheets are in much better Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL condition.  If you look at nonfinancial corporations, you see—you do see relatively elevated levels of borrowing, but nothing that suggests, you know, serious risks.  And, of course, default rates are very low.  So those readings look okay.  I should mention also that for large financial institutions, they’re no longer funded by a lot of short-term wholesale funding, which can disappear very quickly, so they’re far less vulnerable to liquidity issues.  Overall, those aspects, I think, suggest low levels of vulnerability. You identified the—really, one area where—which is an area of focus, which is asset prices.  So, in some areas, asset prices are elevated relative to their longer-run historical norms.  You can think of some equity prices.  You can think of commercial real estate prices in certain a pie, what you have is moderate vulnerabilities, in our view.  In terms of whether we have the tools, you know, we have some tools, and I think we certainly—we use them.  We have—I think the stress test is a really important tool that we have for the largest financial institutions and for the smaller financial institutions.  We regularly use that to—as a way to test against various, you know, market shocks, certainly for the larger institutions.

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  More on the regulatory side, you know, the Fed might soon be getting more power to decide exactly which regulations—which stricter regulations to apply to banks with between $100 and $250 billion in assets.  And so I had a couple of questions about that.  So, for CCAR, those stress tests, since that’s based around, you know, having a punitive penalty of potentially being able to restrict dividend payouts or stock buybacks, is there any kind of logistical challenge that could be posed if you don’t have CCAR every year for certain banks?  Is it possible to have CCAR not on an annual basis? March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL And then, my other question is, you know, you’ve talked a lot about how size isn’t the only thing that causes banks to pose systemic risk, and I was wondering, what other factors do you think would cause a bank to potentially pose a systemic risk? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Okay.  So, this is a matter that Congress has under consideration.  It’s not something—so Congress is looking at raising the threshold for applying enhanced financial standards to—from $50 billion to $250 billion, while leaving us with the ability to reach below $250 billion and apply those standards where we think it’s appropriate.  And, you know, we haven’t been shy about doing that, because, of course, one of the eight SIFIs is below 250 already.  So we are fully prepared to do that.  But this is a decision that’s in the hands of Congress.  It’s not something that’s been—been taken.  The version of the bill, I think, that passed the Senate did have—did give us the ability to do supervisory stress tests periodically, as opposed to annually, is the language.  We haven’t made any decision about that at all.  We would want to think very carefully about that, and, you know, we would—whatever we do decide to do, we’d put that out for comment.  Is it, you know, logistically possible?  I would think it would be, but it’s certainly not something that we’ve decided to do.  And the second question you had was? 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  About what causes banks to pose systemic risk beyond size. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sure.  Well, it’s—I guess the next thing on the list would be activities.  So, you know, we—regular way commercial banks that do deposit taking and lending and don’t speculate in markets, you know, that’s one business model.  Another business model might be, you know, if you think of a hedge fund, right?  That’s what they do.  They’re speculating on markets, and—you know, so very different business models and different levels of risk and that sort of thing.  So, that’s—that would be the next thing on the list.  I mean, there March 21, 2018  would be a range of things, you know—how well capitalized is the institution, but mainly those Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL things. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  I’d like to go back to the idea of the additional growth that you’re getting from the fiscal package and ask you how much you think comes from the supply side and how much from demand?  You use words like “might” and “should” about what results should come from this process, but, around the table, did any of the presidents or Governors report that businesses are actually getting ready to spend?  Is this something that’s going to happen?  Do we know that there’s going to be a supply-side effect, or are you just guessing at this point? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Remember that there are 15 FOMC participants, and we—each of us has his or her own forecast.  So there’s a real diversity of views on this, particularly on these fiscal issues.  If I could try to summarize, it would be that, I think, broadly speaking, participants believe there will be meaningful increases in demand from the new fiscal policies for at least the next, let’s say, three years.  I think there’s a general view as well that supply-side issues—that there could be supply-side effects as well, and you would see that again through higher investment, driven by lower corporate tax rates and the expensing of some investment, which would drive—tend to drive productivity over time.  If you make investment more attractive, companies should do more of it.  It’s uncertain, though.  I mean, I spent many years of my life working with companies and discussing—and, you know, the cost of capital is one of many factors that they’ll consider.  It isn’t the only factor or the principle factor, but it should result in more investment, and investment should drive productivity. At the same time, the—you know, I mentioned labor supply.  You should see some labor supply effects over time from lower individual effective tax rates.  The whole thing is very March 21, 2018  uncertain, and particularly the supply-side effects should and would be expected to take longer to Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL appear and would be less certain in amount.  So that’s really as good as you can go.  And, you know, we’ve all looked at the literature carefully.  We’ve all thought about it.  We’ve discussed it with our in-house experts and come up with our own views, and they’re disparate, but that’s—I’d say that’s about where the—where the views are. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Donna Borak with CNN.  Just to go back to trade policy, if you don’t mind.  You said that participants today generally are feeling that the trade policy shouldn’t necessarily affect the current economic outlook, but I am wondering if there was any discussion—if there are fears about inflationary effects, should there be trade barriers imposed?  And, secondly, you know, we might be on the verge of a tit-for-tat trade war with China.  Wondering what your thoughts are of how that might dampen the economic—the global economic outlook going forward should that occur. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, at this stage, what our FOMC participants discussed—it wasn’t—it was—it was just that this is a new risk that had been probably a low-profile risk, which has become, you know, a more prominent risk to the outlook.  That’s really what people were saying.  They didn’t get into talking about particular—you know, whether it’s inflation or growth or whatever it would be.  So that’s not something that did come up.  You know—your second question, sorry, was China? 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Yes.  I mean, in the event that the United States and China—in the event that the U.S. and China end up in a tit-for-tat trade war, or any other retaliatory actions that are imposed elsewhere against the United States, what that means for the global economic outlook, and whether that was something that was discussed and are you worried about. March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIMRAN POWELL.  That didn’t—it’s not something that came up in particular.  And, let me say, you know, we don’t do trade policy here at the Fed, and, you know, I would be reluctant to comment on any particular situation with any particular country. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Does the interest rate hike today suggest that Americans are being paid enough?  Are you satisfied with the rate of wage growth right now? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  As I mentioned, you know, we’ve had unemployment decline sharply since, I guess, 2010, when it peaked at 10 percent and down to 4.1 percent now, and we’ve seen only modest increases in wages.  So, on the one hand, what wages should in theory represent is inflation plus productivity increases.  You should get paid for your productivity plus inflation.  And productivity’s been very low.  Inflation’s been low.  So these low wage increases—in a sense, they do make sense in that—from that perspective. On the other hand, as the market has tightened, as labor markets have tightened, and we hear reports of labor shortages and we see that, you know, groups of unemployed are diminishing, and the unemployment rate is going down, we haven’t seen, you know, higher wages—wages going up more.  And I would—I think I’ve been surprised by that, and I think others have as well.  In terms of what’s the right level, I don’t think I have a view on what the right level of wages is, but I think we will—we will know that the labor market is getting tight when we do see a more meaningful upward move in wages. 

[SECTION]

VIRGINIE MONTET.  Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse.  If the economy behaves as the Fed is predicting, by the time of the midterm elections, the rates will be—keep on rising, and the prime rate will be above—well above 5 percent, a level not reached in 10 years for what is a base of consumer credit.  And we know that, historically, raising rates—especially March 21, 2018  in campaign times—has never been very popular in the White House.  Does this prospect of a Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL possible pressure and dichotomy of concerns keep you awake at night? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  No.  That doesn’t keep me awake at night.  We don’t consider the election cycle.  You know, we—we’re looking very carefully at our assigned responsibilities of maximum employment, stable prices, and that’s really our focus.  You can count on us to stay focused on the jobs that Congress has assigned us and count on us to use the tools we have to achieve them.  You’re right, that’s the highest rate.  By the way, I’m hearing this, the 10-year thing a few times these days, and it’s true that rates are higher than they’ve been in 10 years.  On the other hand, the economy’s healthier than it’s been since—since before the financial crisis.  So, it’s a healthier economy than it’s been in 10 years.  The financial crisis, of course, was just really getting going 10 years ago. 

[SECTION]

MYLES UDLAND.  Thanks.  Myles Udland, Yahoo Finance.  Chair Powell, I’m curious if the Fed would be willing to tolerate an inverted yield curve.  We continue to see the spread between the 2-year and the 10-year tighten, even with longer-term yields coming up since the beginning of the year.  This is a dynamic that has typically preceded recessions, and we’re likely to see shorter-term rates come up as the Fed continues to increase rates.  So, I’m just curious if you guys have discussed that, if you’d be willing to push back against that, or if that’s a dynamic you’d be comfortable with? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, it’s an interesting question, and there are a range of views there.  I think it’s true that yield curves have tended to predict recessions if you look back over many cycles, but a lot of that was just situations in which inflation was allowed to get out of control, and the Fed had to tighten, and that put the economy into a recession.  That’s really not the situation we’re in now, so I don’t know that that’s—I don’t know that—I don’t think that March 21, 2018  recession probabilities are particularly high at the moment, any higher than they normally are.  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL But, having said that, I think it’s—there are good questions about what a flat yield curve or inverted yield curve does to intermediation.  It’s hard to find in the research data, but nonetheless, I think those are issues that we’ll be watching carefully. Thank you very much. ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
21,2018-06-13,"CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Good afternoon.  Thanks very much for being here.  I know that a number of you will want to talk about the details of our announcement today, and I am happy to do that in a few minutes.  But because monetary policy affects everyone, I want to start with a plain-English summary of how the economy is doing, what my colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are trying to do, and why. The main takeaway is that the economy is doing very well.  Most people who want to find jobs are finding them, and unemployment and inflation are low.  Interest rates have been low for some years while the economy has been recovering from the financial crisis.  For the past few years, we have been gradually raising interest rates, and along the way we’ve tried to explain the reasoning behind our decisions.  In particular, we think that gradually returning interest rates to a more normal level as the economy strengthens is the best way the Fed can help sustain an environment in which American households and businesses can thrive.  Today, we’ve taken another step in that process by raising our target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ of a percentage point. My colleagues and I meet eight times a year and take a fresh look each time at what is happening in the economy and consider whether our policy needs adjusting.  We don’t put our interest rate decisions on hold or on autopilot, because the economy can always evolve in unexpected ways.  History has shown that moving interest rates either too quickly or too slowly can lead to bad economic outcomes.  We think the outcomes are likely to be better overall if we are as clear as possible about what we are likely to do and why.  To that end, we try to give a sense of our expectations for how the economy will evolve and how our policy stance may change.  June 13, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL As Chairman, I hope to foster a public conversation about what the Fed is doing to support a strong and resilient economy.  And one practical step in doing so is to have a press conference like this after every one of our scheduled FOMC meetings.  And we’re going to do that beginning in January.  That will give us more opportunities to explain our actions and to answer your questions.  I want to point out that having twice as many press conferences does not signal anything about the timing or pace of future interest rate changes.  This change is only about improving communications.  My FOMC colleagues and I will also continue to issue our economic projections on the existing quarterly schedule. Now, let me go into more detail over developments in the economy, our economic projections, and our policy decision.  Economic growth appears to have picked up in the current quarter, largely reflecting a bounceback in household spending.  Business investment continues to grow strongly, and the overall outlook for growth remains favorable.  Several factors support this assessment:  Fiscal policy is boosting the economy, ongoing job gains are raising incomes and confidence, foreign economies continue to expand, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative.  These observations are consistent with the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting.  The median projection for the growth of real GDP is 2.8 percent this year, 2.4 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2020.  Compared with the projections made in March, this median growth path is little changed. In the labor market, job gains averaged 180,000 per month over the past three months, well above the pace needed in the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants into the workforce.  The unemployment rate declined over the past two months and stood at 3.8 percent in May, its lowest level in nearly two decades.  Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate has been roughly unchanged since late 2013.  That is a positive sign, given that the aging of our  June 13, 2018  population is putting downward pressure on the participation rate.  And we expect the job market Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  to remain strong.  As you can see in our Summary of Economic Projections, the median of Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate stands at 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs at 3.5 percent over the next two years, a percentage point below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate.  This median path is just a bit lower than that from After many years of running below our 2 percent longer-run objective, inflation has recently moved close to that level.  Indeed, overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 2 percent over the 12 months ending in indicator of future inflation, rose 1.8 percent over the same period.  As we had expected, inflation moved up as the unusually low readings from last March dropped out of the calculation.  The recent inflation data have been encouraging, but after many years of inflation below our objective, we do not want to declare victory.  We want to ensure that inflation remains near our symmetric 2 percent longer-run goal on a sustained basis.  As we note in our Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below our 2 percent objective.  Of course, many factors affect inflation—some temporary and others more lasting—and at any given time inflation may be above or below 2 percent.  For example, the recent rise in oil prices will likely push inflation somewhat above 2 percent in coming months.  But that transitory development should have little, if any, consequence for inflation over the next few years.  The median of participants’ projections for inflation runs at 2.1 percent through 2020.  Relative to the March projections, the median inflation projection is a little higher this year and next.  June 13, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL As I mentioned, today we took another step in gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation by raising the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1¾ to 2 percent.  We also made some changes to our policy statement, reflecting that policy normalization is proceeding broadly as we have expected.  None of these changes signals a change in our policy views.  For example, we removed the language stating that “the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.”  Since we introduced that language a few years ago, the economy has strengthened, and the Committee has raised the federal funds rate from near 0 to 1¾ to 2 percent.  As we continue to note in our statement, we expect to make further gradual increases in that rate.  As a result, if the economy evolves broadly as we anticipate, the federal funds rate will, over the next year or so, move well within the range of estimates of the normal long-run level.  Therefore, we thought that now is an appropriate time to remove this forward guidance from our policy statement. We continue to believe that a gradual approach for increasing the federal funds rate will best promote a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent goal.  We are aware that raising rates too slowly might raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road in response to an unexpectedly sharp increase in inflation or financial excesses, jeopardizing the economic expansion.  Conversely, if we raise interest rates too rapidly, the economy could weaken, and inflation could continue to run persistently below our objective. The Committee’s gradual approach is reflected in participants’ projections for the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.  The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.4 percent at the end of this year, 3.1 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of  June 13, 2018  2020.  By 2020, the median federal funds rate is modestly above its estimated longer-run level.  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  These projections are very similar to those made in March.  Although the median federal funds rate edged up this year and next, most participants did not revise their projections. I’ll conclude by mentioning two additional matters.  First, our program for reducing our balance sheet, which began in October, is proceeding smoothly.  Barring a material and unexpected weakening in the outlook, this program will proceed on schedule, and our balance sheet will continue to shrink.  As we have said, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. And, finally, as discussed in the minutes of our May meeting, we’re making a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy.  To keep the federal funds rate in the target range, we rely on the rate of interest on excess reserves, or the IOER rate.  Up until now, we have set the IOER rate at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate.  In recent months, the federal funds rate has moved up toward the IOER rate as short-term interest rates have risen more generally.  So to move the federal funds rate closer to the middle of the target range, we are now setting the IOER rate 5 basis points below the upper end of the target range.  This minor technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate or financial conditions more generally.  Thanks for listening, and I’ll be happy to take your questions. 

[SECTION]

JIM TANKERSLEY.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Jim Tankersley, New York Times.  I have a question about inflation and a question about growth.  On inflation, I’m curious if there’s anything that’s happened since March that has changed your assessment of the risk of inflation increases beyond what you forecast in the year to come.  And, on growth, you mentioned fiscal  June 13, 2018  policy is adding to growth, and I’m curious if you could break that down a little bit further for us Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  and say—what effects do you think the recent tax cuts are having on growth? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sure.  So since—I wouldn’t say anything has happened since about inflation.  We’ve seen inflation move very gradually up toward our 2 percent objective.  And part of that has been just idiosyncratic things dropping out from last March, which were holding inflation—measured inflation—down.  Part of it is just that continued tightening in the labor market and the economy more broadly is pushing inflation up.  So we continue to think, and the Committee continues to think, that we are just about at our 2 percent goal but, as I mentioned, not ready to declare victory until we sustain that over time, which we haven’t done yet. You also asked about fiscal policy, and there’s a range of views on the Committee and, I think more broadly, a range of views among economists generally.  But I can say that the Committee members—Committee participants—generally believe that the fiscal changes—and that includes both the tax cuts, individual and corporate, and the spending changes—will provide meaningful support to demand, significant support to demand over the course of the next three years.  And the question—the other question is, what about the supply side?  So it is—it makes sense that if you lower corporate tax rates and allow faster expensing of investment, you will encourage greater investment.  That should drive productivity.  That should increase potential output.  So that really ought to happen as well.  I think the amounts and the timing of that coming in are also quite uncertain.  There’s also the possibility that there would be more labor supply from lower individual tax rates, again, in amounts and in timing that might be more uncertain.  So that’s how the Committee generally is thinking about—about fiscal policy.  June 13, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks.  Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.  So the Fed is about four interest rate increases, using the projections released today, away from what might be considered a neutral fed funds rate.  And I wanted to ask how you’re thinking about what to do once you get to neutral.  Under what conditions would you decide, once you get there, that it’s okay to stop raising rates?  And under what conditions would you want to keep going? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So for many, many years, we’ve been far from maximum employment and stable prices, and so the need for accommodative policy has been—has been clear.  As the economy has strengthened and as we’ve gradually raised interest rates, the question comes into view of, how much longer will you need to be accommodative?  And how will you know?  How will you know where—at what point policy will be neutral?  Neutral meaning that interest rates are neither pushing the economy up nor trying to restrain it.  So we know that we’re getting closer to that neutral level.  We don’t have an exact sense of how that will be.  So the Committee is discussing, very actively, the questions that you raise.  And, really, it boils down to a question of, what is appropriate policy?  And, you know, I—you asked, how will we know?  So I think we’ll be very carefully looking at incoming data on inflation, on financial readings, and on the labor market.  We have to acknowledge that there are always wide uncertainty bands around the level of, for example, the natural rate of unemployment.  But also, what is the neutral rate of interest?  What is that rate of interest that pushes neither up nor down?  So I think we—we’ll be guided by incoming data on the economy and try to keep our minds open as we move 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  2.1 percent above target for two and a half years starts to feel like some of the alternate frameworks that have been discussed forward.  June 13, 2018  here, be it price-level targeting or trying to set expectations higher so that you hit your 2.  In Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, the—our target for—our medium-term objective for inflation is 2 percent PCE inflation.  We feel that that target has served the economy well, and I’m strongly committed to it.  The Committee is strongly committed to it.  The sort of barriers to making a material change to that would be—would be very high because, again, we think it’s fundamental, and we think it’s worked. You asked about price-level targeting and that sort of thing.  You know, there are some ideas that sort of take cognizance of the fact that rates are lower, we’re near the zero lower bound, and that could put downward pressure on inflation expectations if we’re going to be down at the zero lower bound and, therefore, sort of undermine the credibility of the 2 percent inflation objective.  So the idea is to have kind of a makeup.  If you—if you’re below target for a while, you have a—you have a time of being above target.  And the idea is to enhance the credibility of that 2 percent—that 2 percent target.  This is an idea that’s been written about for many years.  It’s not something that the Committee has looked at seriously.  I imagine we will be having discussions about it, but—not something that we have on the calendar right now. 

[SECTION]

SAM FLEMING.  Well, thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.  Over the weekend, we saw some significant tensions within the G-7.  In Canada, there is the potential, obviously, for further action against China right now and retaliatory action from major U.S. trading partners.  How big a risk do you currently see this as being to the United States economy?  And what kind of feedback are you getting in terms of corporate investment intentions?  Is there something that’s beginning to feature more prominently in your own discussions with major U.S. companies?  Thanks.  June 13, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I ought to start by saying that, you know, Congress has assigned us very important jobs and—you know, maximum employment, stable prices, we have a role in financial stability that we share with other agencies.  Congress has very specifically given authority over trade to the executive branch, so I wouldn’t comment on any particular specific trade actions.  I will say that we, of course, have—we have broad contacts in—among business leaders around the country.  And the Reserve Bank presidents, in particular, have that.  And so they report in the Beige Book and then in person at the FOMC meeting.  And they do come back and they say that concerns about changes in trade policy are arising, I think it’s fair to say, and also that you’re beginning to hear reports of companies holding off on making investments and hiring people.  So right now we don’t see that in the numbers at all.  The economy is very strong.  The labor market is strong.  Growth is strong.  We really don’t see it in the numbers.  It’s just not there.  But—so I would put it down as more of a risk. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, you said there’s a difference of opinion among economists, but looking at the longer-run GDP growth rates for the members of the Committee, there’s not a whole lot of difference.  It’s 1.8 to 2, or 1.7 to 2.1, depending upon how you count it.  Is that showing us that not a single member of the Committee—including yourself, Mr. Chairman—agrees with economists over at the White House that they can achieve long-run sustained growth rates above or at 3 percent or higher?  Do you believe in 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, first of all, that’s a—that’s a reasonable range, I think, of—it’s not that we’re all on the same number, but there are a range of views about potential growth.  And there’s so much uncertainty around this.  You know, we don’t—the thing about fiscal policy is, you don’t have thousands of incidents to, you know, to—you don’t have that?  June 13, 2018  big data, in a way.  You have very small data.  You’ve got only a few instances here, so you have Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  a lot of uncertainty around what the effects will be.  They could be large.  We hope they’re large.  But I think our approach is going to be to watch and see and hope that, in fact, we do get significant effects to, you know, to potential growth out of the tax bill, and we’re just going to have to see. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  How would you forecast it though? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I think we’re looking at a reasonable range of estimates and we’re putting every—different participants are putting different estimates in and we’re going to be waiting and seeing. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak with CNN.  You said earlier that it’s still a little too early to declare victory on inflation.  I wanted to circle back on a question that was asked at the initial press conference about what—what does the Fed say in regards to the inflation target as symmetric?  Like has the Committee given any further thought in terms of how comfortable it would be rising above—whether it goes higher than 2.1, if it reaches 2.2, 2.3, and for how long?  And now that you’re planning to hold these regular press conferences, starting next year, how do you explain—how do you plan to explain that to the American people that inflation is not overrunning? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, what we’ve said in our Statement of Longer-Run Principles and Monetary Policy Strategy is that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were to run persistently above or below 2 percent, persistently above or below 2 percent.  And that’s what we mean by symmetric.  We’re looking at it equally on either side and it’s a matter of persistent overruns.  We know that inflation is going to bounce around.  For example, as I mentioned, later this summer there’s a good chance that headline inflation will move up above  June 13, 2018  2 percent because of oil prices.  Things buffet inflation back and forth, but—so we acknowledge Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  that, we understand that—and if inflation were to persistently run above or below 2 percent, then we would be using our tools to try to move inflation back in the direction of the target.  We do understand, though, that we don’t have the ability to precisely hit that target, so we expect that inflation will be above or below.  And we just hope that that is—happens on a symmetric basis. hiked your—the funds rate, you changed the dot plot to move from 3 to 4 for this year, and you took out a sentence that you’d been using for years about how long rates might stay low.  But you say that none of this signals a change in policy views.  But shouldn’t we see from this combination of things that the Fed is moving to tighter policy?

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I think what you should see is that the economy is continuing to make progress.  The economy has strengthened so much since I joined the Fed, you know, in 2012 and even over the last couple of years.  The economy is in a very different place.  We— unemployment was 10 percent at the height of the crisis.  It’s 3.8 percent now and moving lower.  So really what you—the decision you see today is another sign that the U.S. economy is in great shape.  Growth is strong, labor markets are strong, inflation is close to target, and that’s what you’re seeing.  For many years, as I mentioned—many years—we had interest rates held low to support economic activity.  And it’s been clear that as we’ve gotten closer to our statutory goals, we should normalize policy, and that’s really what we’ve been consistently doing for some years 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Heather Long from the Washington Post.  Can you give us an update on what the FOMC thinks about wages?  Are we finally going to see that now.  June 13, 2018  wage growth pickup this year?  I know you’re forecasting a little bit more inflation, but is that Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL going to translate through to wage growth? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, wages have been gradually moving up.  Earlier in the recovery, they were—there are many different wage measures, of course, but—so just—but just to generalize, wages were running roughly around 2 percent and they’ve moved gradually up into between 2 to 3 percent as the labor market has become stronger and stronger.  I think it’s fair to say that some of us—and I certainly would have expected wages to react more to the very significant reduction in unemployment that we’ve had, as I mentioned, from 10 percent to 3.8 percent.  Part of that can be explained by low productivity, which is something we’ve talked about at the Committee and elsewhere.  But, nonetheless, I think we had anticipated, and many people have anticipated, that wages—that in a world where we’re hearing lots and lots about labor shortages—everywhere we go now, we hear about labor shortages—but where is the wage reaction?  So it’s a bit of a puzzle.  I wouldn’t say it’s a mystery, but it’s a bit of a puzzle. And, frankly, I do think there’s a lot to like about low unemployment.  And one of the things is—you will see—pretty much people who want to get jobs—not everybody—but people who want to get jobs, many of them will be able to get jobs.  You will see wages go up.  You’ll see people at the, sort of, the margins of the labor force having an opportunity to get back in work.  They benefit from that.  Society benefits from that.  So there are a lot of things to really like, including higher wages, as you asked.  Our role, though, is also to, you know, to make sure that—that maximum employment happens in a context of price stability and financial stability, which is why we’re gradually raising rates. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Just a follow-up on—Don Lee from the L.A. Times.  On both inflation and unemployment, the new projections—for unemployment lower than before and inflation higher.   June 13, 2018  And how much is the Fed willing to accept that’s an overshoot for both of those before it affects Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  policy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You mentioned that unemployment moved down and inflation moved up by truly small amounts.  If you look at the Summary of Economic Projections, things are moving by just a tick or even a semitick between now and March.  And you asked, you know—I mean, I think we take a longer-run view that we’re shooting for—we’re aiming for—2 percent inflation—inflation around 2 percent.  We know that it’ll be above or below.  We’re not going to—we didn’t overreact, I think, to inflation being under 2 percent.  We won’t overreact to it being over 2 percent.  And I think we’ll always be using our tools to move inflation in the direction of the target, if it—if it leaves—if it moves away from the target persistently, as I mentioned. In terms of unemployment, you know, you have to acknowledge that we are—no one really knows with certainty what the level of the natural rate of unemployment is, the rate that is sustainable over a long period of time.  And we know that probably that rate has declined as the U.S. population has become more educated, as it has become older.  Older and more educated people have lower unemployment rates.  We don’t know this with precision.  So we have to be learning as we go.  We’ve got to be looking at data and informed by what’s coming in.  And as I mentioned, I think at the last press conference, estimates by the—by members of the Committee have moved down by a full percentage point since maybe 2012 as we’ve learned—as unemployment has dropped and inflation hasn’t really reacted.  So I can’t give you a precise number, but I just—you know, we will be very much informed by incoming data.  And this uncertainty is why—the fact that we live in that uncertainty is why we’ve been gradually raising rates.  We’re not waiting for inflation to show up.  We’re going ahead and moving gradually and  June 13, 2018  trying to navigate between two risks, really.  One would be moving too quickly—inflation never Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  gets back to target if we do that.  And the other is moving too slowly, and then we have—we have too much inflation or financial instability, and we have to raise quickly.  And that can also have bad outcomes. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER CONDON.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Mr. Chairman, I have a couple questions about the interest the Fed pays on excess reserves.  And you mentioned, of course, that—that the IOER was raised by the Committee 20 basis points, and that’s a result, as you said, of the upward drift of the effective fed funds rate in that target range.  Do you think that that’s going to resolve that issue or might there be further action required by the Committee in the future to continue lowering IOER relative to the midpoint of the range?  And, further, was there discussion among the Committee today about what’s causing that?  Is it purely technical, perhaps related to bill issuance, or is it telling you something about the level of scarcity and truly excess bank reserves?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thanks.  So I would say that—remember the important thing is that we want the federal funds rate to trade in the target range.  That’s the whole, the whole idea.  IOER is the principal tool by which we assure that that will happen.  And we’ve said in our, you know, basic documents that we will adjust the use of our tools, as appropriate.  We don’t expect to have to do this often or again, but we’re not sure about that.  If we have to do it again, we’ll do it again.  Again, don’t expect it to happen.  You asked why.  And yes, you know, we—of course, we’re looking carefully at that and, you know, the truth is we don’t—we don’t know with any precision.  Really, no one does.  It’s—you can’t run experiments, you know, with one effect and not the other.  You know, I think there’s a lot of probability on the idea of just high bill supply leads to higher repo costs, higher money market rates generally, and the arbitrage pulls up  June 13, 2018  federal funds rate towards IOER.  We don’t know that that’s the only effect and, you know, Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL we’re just going to have to be watching and learning.  And, frankly, we don’t have to know today.  What we really need is to have the federal funds rate trade in the range, and that’s what this minor technical adjustment accomplishes. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.  So with the numbers that we’re looking at, you talked about more people getting jobs, the wages are increasing.  Are we seeing a—with the fiscal policy—a fundamental shift in the economy, where we have lower natural unemployment, also possibly a lower rate of natural unemployment and lower inflation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Your question—your first question, really, is, do we think the natural rate of unemployment is lower?  So I think we do believe it has moved down significantly over a long period of time.  We don’t think that the natural rate of unemployment—you know, it’s not one of those variables that moves around a lot.  It tends to be driven by slow-moving variables, like the education level, the population, like the functioning of the labor basis, lower.  As the economy gets hotter and hotter, there’s some possibility of that.  But, you know, the thing is, if you look back, there have been a lot of studies done and, you know, real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment have uncertainty bands, which are—which are quite wide, so we have to remember that and very much be guided by the—by the incoming You asked about inflation.  You know, inflation we look about—we look at the 2 percent inflation objective as something that central banks, the Fed, really control.  And we have to be strongly committed to achieving that using our tools to do that.  I think in—in recent years the dominant force has been, you know, disinflationary—have been pushing down on inflation.  And data.  June 13, 2018  so we’ve been pushing back up.  Of course, all those years when we were growing up, it was the Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  opposite.  Inflation was too high and central banks were constantly pushing down.  It’s really important that inflation not fall below 2 percent, that inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent—very important—because the implications of inflation below 2 percent are that you’re closer to the zero lower bound, meaning the Fed has less room to cut, meaning that we’ll spend more time there and we won’t be able to do the job that we’re assigned to do for our citizens. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek with Bloomberg Television.  You guys moved the median unemployment forecast for 2020 down to 3.5 percent but left the longer-run at 4.5 percent today.  But you’re only forecasting a moderate overshoot on the fed funds rate beyond your longer-run value.  How are you going to get unemployment from 3.5 percent up to that 4.5 percent rate? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I would just—would—I would just emphasize, emphasize that—a couple things.  First, we’re learning about the real location of the natural rate of unemployment as we go.  So it’s moved down by more than a full percentage point since 2012.  So it’s not so simple as thinking, oh boy, we’ve just got to go ahead and get that rate up.  If you—if you look at the forecast, two years from now, end of 2020, you’re still seeing inflation very close to target.  So there’s no sense that inflation will—no sense in our models, or in our projections, or forecasts—that inflation will take off or move unexpectedly quickly from these levels, even if unemployment does remain low.  So that’s—that’s what—so it’s important to know that the—the unemployment rate forecasts go with the inflation forecasts and go with the rate forecasts.  And so each person who’s submitting them is submitting accommodate—you know, appropriate monetary policy that fits with that person’s assessment.  And their  June 13, 2018  assessments generally are to support maximum employment and stable prices around 2 percent.  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  So if we thought that inflation were going to take off, obviously, we’d be showing higher rates, but that’s not what we think will happen. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  If I could just follow up really quickly.  Then why, I guess, would the longer-run unemployment rate not be a little bit lower and closer to that 2020 number? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Yeah, it may be.  It may be.  We may find that out.  You know, the best estimate that we have, over the longer run, is that.  Although, you know, there’s a range of views, you know.  Some people are in the low 4s, and, again, I said the uncertainty bands are, you know, not quite a full percentage point on either side, but ¾ of a percent, that kind of thing, so it’s very possible.  We have to be, you know—we can’t do—we can’t be too attached to these unobservable variables.  You know, we—I think we have to be practical about the way we think about these things and we do that by being grounded in the data and what we see happening in the real economy. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  I have a couple of regulatory questions.  First of all, on the countercyclical capital buffer, I was wondering, what are the chances that the Fed is going to need to use that in the next year or two?  And then my second question is, there’s been a lot of talk lately in Congress about the ability for banks to serve marijuana businesses, and I was wondering if you think that banks should be able to serve those businesses in states where 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So the countercyclical capital buffer gives us the ability to raise capital requirements on the largest institutions when financial stability vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal.  That’s the language that we’ve used.  And that’s certainly a possibility.  I wouldn’t say that—I wouldn't look at today’s financial stability landscape and say  June 13, 2018  that risks are meaningfully above normal.  I would say that they’re roughly at normal.  You Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL have—you know, households are well—you know, are in good shape.  They’re—they’ve paid down their debt, incomes are rising, people have jobs.  So households are not really a concern.  And banks are highly capitalized, so that’s not really a concern.  We see—there’s some concern with asset prices in a couple of pockets.  But overall, if you—if you bake it all in, I think we see, generally, financial vulnerabilities as moderate.  Could that change, you asked, over a couple of years?  Yeah, it could. You also asked about marijuana businesses.  So this is a very difficult area because we have state law—many state laws permit the use of marijuana and federal law still doesn’t.  So it puts, you know, federally chartered banks in a very difficult situation.  I think it would be great if that could be clarified.  We don’t have—you know, it puts the supervisor in a very, very difficult position.  And, of course, this isn’t our—our mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, so we don’t really—we just would love to see it clarified, I think. 

[SECTION]

JOHN HELTMAN.  Hi, John Heltman with American Banker.  So since you—since even before you were Chairman of the Fed, when you were chair of the supervisory committee, you laid out a sort of regulatory revision agenda that’s actually been pretty consistent.  So there was the guidance on boards of governors, there was the—some changes to the stress tests, and—not changes to the stress test, but rather clarification on the modeling—and now, more recently, the changes to the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio.  The Fed has also proposed some changes to the Volcker rule and, as I mentioned a minute ago, changes to the stress test with the stress capital buffer.  Are these kind of the—are there any new frontiers of regulatory changes that you are envisioning or are you just—are you kind of done for the time being?  Or what else can we expect from the Fed?  June 13, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  It’s actually a pretty full docket right now.  You mentioned a number of the things, but I would—I would point out—we’re having, I guess, a public Board meeting tomorrow on the single counterparty credit limit provision.  We’ve also got quite a lot of work to promulgate rules to—after S. 2155 that Senator Crapo’s bill passed—we’ve got a lot of work to do under that.  We’ve got to think about how we would reach below that $250 billion threshold to assess and supervise, regulate, you know, financial stability risks below that level. So what am I missing?  There’s—there—oh, oh, net stable funding ratio is out there to be done.  So there’s a lot of work to do, I think.  You know, and if I can just take this opportunity to say, you know, the financial system all but failed 10 years ago.  We went to work for 10 years to strengthen it—stronger capital, stronger liquidity, stress testing, resolution planning.  We want to keep all that stuff.  We want to make it, you know, even more effective and certainly more efficient.  We want to tailor those regulations for institutions.  We want the strongest provisions to apply to the most systemically important institutions.  And so we’re committed to preserving and enhancing that structure.  But we—we’re finding a lot that we can do in the way of tailoring regulations for the smaller, less systemically important institutions, and that’s a lot of what we’re working on right now. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  You said at the beginning of your press conference that you plan to be more plainspoken.  And so, okay, I wanted to know what you would say to workers who are worried that, you know, these paths of rate hikes that you’ve laid out will kind of undercut the wage growth they are just starting to see.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, I would say that the economy is in great shape.  If you look at household surveys, confidence is high.  Look at businesses, confidence is high.  If you ask—if you survey workers about the job market, they’ll say that it’s a really good  June 13, 2018  environment to find jobs.  If you survey businesses, they’ll say that workers are scarce.  So I Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL think overall, we have—we have a really solid economy on our hands here.  And so what we’re doing is, we are trying to conduct monetary policy in a way that will sustain that expansion, keep the labor markets strong, and keep inflation above—right at—sorry, not above, but right at 2 percent.  That’s really what we’re trying to do and, you know, I would say I like the results so far.  We’re—we’ve been very, very careful not to tighten too quickly.  I think we’ve been patient.  I think that patience has borne fruit and I think it continues to.  We had a lot of encouragement to go much faster and I’m really glad we didn’t.  But, at this time, the—continuing on that gradual pace seems—continues to seem like the right thing.  If we get a sense that the economy is reacting badly, then we’ll certainly react to that. 

[SECTION]

DAVID HARRISON.  Hi, David Harrison with Dow Jones Newswires.  Where do you see the neutral interest rate is right now?  Do you think it’s—do you see it sort of inching up because of the recent fiscal stimulus measures?  And how will you know when we’re getting close to that neutral point?  So if—you know, if inflation stays around 2, it doesn’t go above 2 for a while, do you see a need to actually exceed that neutral point? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So I would just point you to the range of estimates at the Committee, which I think is 2¼ to 3½, and the median is 2.9, right in there.  So that’s the range of estimates of the nominal neutral rate of interest.  And we do understand that there’s high uncertainty around the level, but that’s kind of—so you can think of 2.9 as being—which is sort of a full percentage point away from where fed funds is going to trade after today’s decision.  You asked, is the—is the neutral rate moving up because of fiscal policy?  Yes.  I mean, there’s—there should be an effect if you have increased deficits that should put upward pressure on, you know, a few tenths, let’s say.  Again, though, they were estimating these things.  It’s one  June 13, 2018  of these unobserved variables so it’s very hard to—we shouldn’t try to speak about it with a—Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL with a lot of precision or confidence.  But, yes, that should put upward pressure on it.  How will we know?  Well, I think you have to look at inflation.  You’ve got to look at—you’ve got to look at all of the indicators in the economy and look at inflation, look at unemployment, look at what’s happening in the job market.  And inflation is really important.  It’s worth noting that the last two business cycles didn’t end with high inflation—they ended with financial instability—so that’s something we need to also keep our eye on. 

[SECTION]

VIRGINIE MONTET.  Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse.  Have you talked during the meeting about when the Fed is going to remove or change the word “accommodative” that describe the monetary policy for almost 10 years?  And could this change in the vocabulary make the market nervous?  And have you thought already at some options so to know how you’re going to call it down the road? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Yes, that is—that is something that we discuss.  We look at all the language.  As you know, we made a—we made a significant number of changes at this meeting.  So language gets in the statement and then, you know, the economy changes.  That’s what happens.  We really—our approach to policy hasn’t changed.  And, you know, as I mentioned earlier, for a long time, the economy has needed accommodative monetary policy.  As the economy has recovered, we’ve been gradually raising rates and we will—we will be at a place relatively soon when, again, assuming we stay on this path, when interest rates will be in the zone of what FOMC participants think is roughly neutral.  And, at that point, it would no longer be accurate for us to say that the Committee thinks that policy is accommodative.  We know that’s coming.  We kind of don’t think it’s here yet, but it’s certainly coming.  And I think that the market will understand that.  I mean, the real message is that you’re getting close to the  June 13, 2018  neutral rate.  It’s a characterization about where policy is.  It’s not a statement, really, that should Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  upset the markets.  But, you know, we’ll obviously discuss it carefully in meetings and communicate about it.  So. 

[SECTION]

NAOATSU AOYAMA.  Thank you very much.  Naoatsu Aoyama from the Asahi Shimbun, Japan’s newspaper.  Would you expand on the—on your views on the downside risks—downside risks, especially in regard to trade issues?  Many people are—in the key allies of the United States—are concerned that the United States may destabilize the underpinnings of the international liberal order the United States has created and built up in the postwar environment.  So—and that will, of course, have a very negative economic implications for the global economy as well as the U.S. economy.  So would you—have you—can I have your views on that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sure.  So, you know, as I mentioned earlier, I’m really committed to staying in our lane on things.  We have very important jobs assigned to us by Congress and that’s maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability.  Trade is explicitly assigned to the executive branch by Congress and not to us.  So we don’t really—we don’t really seek to play a role in trade policy.  We’re not at that table.  Those are—those powers and mentioned earlier, we do hear from our business contacts, which are extensive in the United States, and we do report on that in the minutes, and I’ve just mentioned what those are.  There is —there is concern that trade changes could be disruptive.  And I also—as I also mentioned, we don’t see it in the numbers yet.  We really don’t.  We see a very strong economy across a bunch of fronts.  It hasn’t reached everyone, let’s be clear on that.  But most people who want a job can  June 13, 2018  find one.  We’re well aware that there are pockets out there of people who have not felt the Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL recession yet, but, broadly speaking, it’s a good economy.1 

[SECTION]

STEVEN BECKNER.  Steve Beckner, Mr. Chairman, freelance journalist reporting for NPR.  About financial conditions, which worries you more—warnings that rising short-term rates are bringing the yield curve closer to inversion, or the fact that long rates have risen very slowly and, in fact, are nearly 20 basis points below their recent high?  How do you account for the fact that long rates have been so slow to rise?  And what does it say about the inflation outlook as well? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So let me—let me briefly mention the yield curve.  I mean, I—the yield curve is something that people are talking about a lot, including FOMC participants.  And I—you have a range of views.  It’s something we’re going to continue to be talking about.  It’s—but it’s only one of many things, of course, that we talk about.  I think that that discussion is really about what is appropriate policy, and how do we think about policy as we approach the neutral rate.  How do we understand what the neutral rate is?  How do we know where it is?  And what are the consequences of being above or below it?  That’s really what—when people are talking about the slope of the yield curve, that’s really what they’re talking about.  We know why—we know why the yield curve is flattening.  It’s because we’re raising the federal funds rate.  It makes all the sense in the world that the short end would come up. I think you asked—the harder question is, what’s happening with long rates?  And there are many things that move long rates around.  Of course, there’s an embedded expectation of the path of short rates.  There’s the term premium, which has been very low by historical standards.  And so arguments are made that a flatter yield curve has less of a signal embedded in it.  In                                                  1 Chairman Powell intended to say that there are pockets of people in the United States who have not yet experienced the economic recovery.  June 13, 2018  addition, I think what you saw most recently that you referred to, Steve, was just risk-on, risk-Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL off.  In a risk-off environment, people want to own U.S. Treasuries, and you see—you know, Treasury prices go up, rates go down quite a lot.  So—but I think ultimately, you know, what we’re—what we really care about is what’s the appropriate stance of policy.  And there’s a—there may be a signal in that long-term rate about what is the neutral rate, and I think that’s why people are paying attention to the yield curve.

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Companies are buying back their shares at a record rate.  Corporate debt is up.  Consumer debt is rising.  Are we in a credit bubble?  Is that something that you’re worried about? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So if you look at households, you do not see excess credit growth, you don’t see high levels of credit going out.  So not so much households.  And that really was where the problems were before the financial crisis, was particularly in—among household borrowing, particularly around mortgages.  With—if you take banks, then, of course, their leverage is significantly lower.  Or, to say it differently, their capital is significantly higher.  If you ask about nonfinancial corporates, that’s really where leverage is at levels that are high relative to history.  But defaults are low, interest rates are low, you know, so it’s something—that’s something we’re watching very carefully.  But, again, I don’t think we see it as—I think there are a range of views on that, but we are watching nonfinancial corporates.  Households are in good shape, though, and that is—that is so important because that’s where—you know, that’s where we got into trouble before.  And that’s—it’s often around property, and particularly housing, where you see real problems emerge.  We don’t really see that now, so we take some solace from that.  June 13, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MYLES UDLAND.  Myles Udland with Yahoo Finance.  Chair Powell, you referenced a minute ago this idea of cushion, or the fact that the Fed doesn’t have as much of when rates are low and inflation is low.  And I’m wondering if you or the Committee has thought about your move to raise interest rates as partly responding to the economy, but partly giving yourselves room to navigate in the inevitable future recession, whenever that was to come.  And do you think that that has played any part in, you know, your outlook for policy or recent policy 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So it doesn’t play any part in my thinking and I’ll tell you why.  If you raise rates too quickly, you’re just increasing the likelihood of a recession, and that’s exactly what you don’t want to do.  So the best thing you can do, I think—I think the incentives actually run in the other direction.  If you’re—if you’re worried about going back to the lower bound, then risk management would suggest that you go a little slower in raising rates and tolerate—that’s likely to be a more sustainable strategy to get further away from the zero lower bound.  I think we’re far enough away now, though, that the risks are kind of balanced.  And so I think it’s more just—we’re just looking at the economy, and what does it need, and how do we—how do we sustain the expansion, keep the labor market strong, and try to keep inflation near 2 percent? growth and your basic message to workers.  How confident are you that when we do see stock buybacks and the like, the workers will get whatever your view of that share is as well and the wage hikes in the near term and in the foreseeable future?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, we don’t—we don’t have the tools to control that.  If companies choose to—companies in our system are free to do what they can—what they need  June 13, 2018  to do once they’ve—once they’ve made profits and have cash to distribute.  They can distribute Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  it to their shareholders, they can buy—either through dividends or through buybacks.  They can pay their workers.  You know, the part—and, you know, we don’t play a role in those decisions.  The part that we focus on is maximum employment.  That’s our mandate.  So we view maximum employment as the maximum sustainable level of employment, meaning it’s not so much that it will cause the economy to overheat.  And so I think we’ve been committed to that.  I think we take that obligation very seriously.  And, you know, over time, when—when labor markets are strong and companies are hiring, we should see higher wages.  But, again, we don’t really have the tools that will address the distribution of profits and that kind of thing.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
22,2018-09-26,"CHAIRMAN POWELL:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Thanks for being here.  I am going to start with an overview of how my colleagues and I see the economy, what we decided today, and then a bit about our expectations for the months ahead. Our economy is strong.  Growth is running at a healthy clip.  Unemployment is low, the number of people working is rising steadily, and wages are up.  Inflation is low and stable.  All of these are very good signs.  Of course, that’s not to say that everything is perfect.  The benefits of this strong economy have not reached all Americans.  Many of our country’s economic challenges are beyond the scope of the Fed, but my colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep the economy strong, healthy, and moving forward.  That is the best way we can promote an  environment in which every American has the opportunity to succeed. Each time my colleagues and I meet, we face the same question:  How can we set policy to best support job growth and low, steady inflation?  For many years, this question called for very low interest rates to help an economy that had been damaged by the deep financial crisis that gripped the world 10 years ago.  As the economy has steadily gained strength, the Fed has  been gradually returning interest rates closer to levels that are normal in a healthy economy.  We took another step on that path today with a quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates.   These rates remain low, and my colleagues and I believe that this gradual return to normal is  helping to sustain this strong economy for the longer-run benefit of all Americans. As I mentioned, 10 years have now passed since the depths of the financial crisis—a painful part of our history that cost many Americans their jobs, their homes, and, for some, their hopes and dreams.  In addition to holding interest rates low to support the recovery, we have also taken many steps to make the financial system safer.  In particular, we’re holding the largest September 26, 2018  banks to much higher standards in the amount of capital and liquidity they hold and in the ways Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL   they assess and manage the risks they take.  I am confident that the system today is stronger and  in a far better position to support the financial needs of households and businesses through good times and bad.  We continue to work to sustain these fundamental improvements while also ensuring that regulation is both effective and efficient. Now, let me go into more detail about the developments that motivated today’s policy overall growth outlook remains favorable.  And several factors support this assessment:  Fiscal policy is boosting the economy, ongoing job gains are raising incomes and confidence, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative.  These conditions are consistent with our Summary of Economic Projections for this meeting.  The median of Committee participants’  projections for the growth of real GDP is 3.1 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year. Job gains averaged 185,000 per month over the last three months, well above the pace needed in the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force.  The unemployment rate stood at 3.9 percent in August and has been near that level since April.  Smoothing through month-to-month variations, the labor force participation rate remains about where it was in late 2013—a positive sign, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on participation.  We expect the job market to remain strong.  And the median of Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate later this year is 3.7 percent and a bit lower than that in 2019. Overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE inflation), increased 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in July.  The core price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food and tends to be a better indicator of September 26, 2018  future inflation, rose 2 percent over the same period.  The FOMC seeks, and expects to see,  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL inflation remaining near our 2 percent longer-run objective on a sustained basis.  At any given time, inflation may be somewhat above or below 2 percent.  For example, the recent rise in oil prices has pushed inflation a little above 2 percent, but we expect this to be transitory, as is reflected in our projections.  The median projections for both the overall and core inflation measures remain very close to 2 percent across the whole projection horizon.  Today the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 2 to 2¼ percent.  This action reflects the strength we see in the economy and is one more step in the process that we began almost three years ago of gradually returning interest rates to more normal levels.  Looking ahead, today’s projections show gradual interest rate increases continuing roughly as foreseen in June.  The median of participants’ views on appropriate policy through 2020 are unchanged since the June meeting. These projections play an important role in our work.  My colleagues and I believe that it’s useful to communicate our views on likely prospects for the economy and for policy.  We are well aware, however, that the economy regularly surprises, and that even the most carefully constructed projections are highly uncertain.  The projections about the appropriate path of policy assume that the economy evolves broadly in line with the projections for growth, employment, unemployment, and inflation.  If the economy were instead to falter, lower interest rates would be appropriate.  Conversely, if inflationary pressures were to rise more than expected, higher interest rates would be appropriate.  Right now, as our statement indicates, risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. Readers of the FOMC statement likely noted that the Committee dropped a sentence that indicated that “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.”  This change does not September 26, 2018  signal any change in the likely path of policy; instead, it is a sign that policy is proceeding in line  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   with our expectations.  We still expect, as our statement says, “further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate,” and this expectation is reflected in the projections that I just discussed.  Thanks very much.  I’m happy to take your questions.

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell,   given the lags of monetary policy, I want to know how you think about ending the tightening cycle?  How will you know when to stop?  And do you need to keep going until something in the economy breaks? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So the tightening cycle, as you know, is a reflection of the strength of the economy.  And it’s almost three years now that we’ve been gradually raising rates.  And I think the fact that we have moved quite gradually, in a way, allows us to carefully watch incoming data in the real economy and in the financial markets to see how the economy is processing higher interest rates.  And the fact that we’re moving so gradually—I think it—I think it limits the long and variable lags problem because, you know, we’re being able to raise rates and then wait and see how the economy absorbs these rate increases.  And so far, the economy has performed very well and very much in keeping with our expectations.

JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times.  President Trump has stated publicly he’s not thrilled with the interest rate hikes.  His comments didn’t appear to have any impact on you or your colleagues.  Were his comments discussed at your meeting?  And do you have any concerns about the effect of these types of comments on the perception of the Fed’s independence and your monetary policy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So we’ve been given a really important job to do on behalf of the American people by Congress, and we’ve been given the tools to do it, and my colleagues September 26, 2018  and I are focused exclusively on carrying out that mission.  We consider the best thinking, the Chairman Powell’s Press Conference    FINAL best theory, and the best evidence.  We have disparate points of view, which we debate extensively and come to a perspective and try to set monetary policy to achieve maximum  employment in a context of price stability.  That’s what we do.  We don’t consider political factors or things like that.  And so that’s who we are, that’s what we do, and that’s just the way it’s always going to be for us. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Can you explain how—the stock market being at a near all-time high, corporate spreads being very tight—how does the level of the market factor into your decisions to raise interest rates?  Is there a concern on your part?  And then, as sort of a second and related part, can you tell us what happens in 2020 and 2021 that—I know you can’t tell us when you’re shaking your head  [laughter]—that prompts—that prompts you—the Fed to think that the rates need to still be above neutral in that time period?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sure.  So in terms of financial markets and monetary policy, we—as we say in our statement every cycle, we do take financial conditions into consideration because financial—broader financial conditions do affect the broader economy, and they’re one of the many things that we take into account.  The part of it that we control, though, is what we do with the federal funds rate and that has—that has effects out through, you know, out through the full interest rate curve and into financial asset prices generally.  So the answer is, we take everything into account, but, you know, broader financial conditions are just one of the things that we take into account. In terms of ’20 and ’21, why—your question was why the funds rate needs to be above neutral?  So you’re right.  Some of—some of the participants have mostly very modest September 26, 2018  overshoots of their personal estimates of neutral a couple—three years out.  You know, it’s far Chairman Powell’s Press Conference    FINAL out into the future.  I think it’s hard to be confident that that’s—that that’s the way things are going to be.  What we’re going to be doing as we—as we go through time is asking at every meeting whether monetary policy is set to achieve our goals.  And I think that that’s an assessment of where policy will need to be some years down the road, and I’ll leave it at that.  

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Chair Powell, I think—is this too good to be true?  Because you’ve got four years here of unemployment below 4 percent—very low, substantially below NAIRU, what appears to be NAIRU—but no reaction of inflation there.  And so I don’t think that’s ever happened since the 1960s.  Why do you think it’s going to happen now?  Or in the alternative, is this forecast for unemployment just being driven by your confidence intervals to the extent that, well, we don’t know what else to do, so just extend the lie out—line out until something happens? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  No, you’re right.  The Committee forecasts what they—what they show, in general, is an economy where unemployment remains in the high and middle 3s throughout the entire forecast period and inflation remains very close to 2 percent.  That is what the forecast shows.  And that is based on our understanding of the way the inflation process works now and on the fact that the inflation seems to be fairly nonreactive to changes in slack— that is to say, a flat Phillips curve.  And it’s just—it’s a—it’s a world of strongly anchored inflation expectations.  And that’s not just our forecast, that’s many forecasts.  So that is—that is —that is the forecast.  So you may ask—I mean, the sense is, what does the longer-run natural  rate of unemployment mean?  And so that really is a longer-run concept that we think the  economy will return to over the longer run.  But, obviously, that longer run, you know, isn’t—  it’s not creating problems in the short run for that forecast. September 26, 2018    Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL Now let’s just admit that the inflation process has changed dramatically from where it  was in the 1960s to where it is now.  It’s in a good place now.  We can’t take for granted that it will remain the way it is, and, you know, we will be, of course, watching carefully.  If inflation reacts more strongly or more weakly to the strong economy, then we’ll adjust policy appropriately.  rates? 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  If I could follow up on that, what are you buying with interest 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Well, interest rates, of course, have effects on growth, have effects—I mean if—I guess the—your question was, what are you buying with by raising interest rates?  The question is, what would the economy look like if you didn’t raise rates?  It would look very different, I think, if we didn’t raise rates. We’re always trying to, you know, work our way between the—sort of the two—the two problems we face.  One is that if we move too quickly, we can, you know, snuff out a recovery unnecessarily, and inflation falls short of its 2 percent target.  Or if we move too slowly, we have an economy that can overheat.  So we’re—that—that’s happened through history.  We don’t see any signs of that now, but we’re always trying to navigate between those two shoals.  And we think that gradually, you know, raising interest rates is the way that we kind of take both of those risks seriously. 

[SECTION]

SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.  The Fed  has recently been saying that financial stability risks are moderate.  What kind of developments could prompt a change in that assessment to elevated risks?  And is there an argument for  moving the countercyclical capital buffer, even when risks are moderate, rather than waiting until the risks are seen as elevated, which, arguably, could be too late?  Thanks.  September 26, 2018   Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So I think one of the most important lessons from the financial crisis is really the importance of the stability of the financial system.  And so we—since the financial crisis, as you’re aware, we’ve had a major focus on building up our monitoring of financial conditions and financial stability issues.  We’ve also put in place many, many initiatives to strengthen the financial system through higher capital and better regulation, more  transparency, central clearing, margins on uncleared derivatives, all kinds of things like that, which are meant to strengthen the financial system.  We’ve done many of those things, and we  feel that the financial system is in a much better place. As we look at—as we look at conditions most recently—and this was at our last meeting, and it was in our minutes for the last meeting—quarterly, we have a briefing at the FOMC, and also at the Board, of the staffs’ views on financial stability, and the staff judged the overall vulnerabilities to be moderate.  If you dig into the different aspects of that question, households or balance sheets are in good shape.  You know, employment is high, wages are rising, that sort of thing.  The banking system, as I mentioned, is—you know, much higher capital, much higher liquidity—is much stronger.  If you look at asset prices, it is true that some asset prices are in the upper range of their historical—upper reach of their historical ranges.  And then if you look at nonfinancial corporates, you get—there is the story of leverage there.  So it’s not that there aren’t any vulnerabilities, but we see them as moderate. Now, you ask about the countercyclical capital buffer.  The countercyclical capital buffer is a tool that we added to our toolkit, I think, finally, back in 2016.  We said that we would deploy it when vulnerabilities were meaningfully above normal.  We revisit that on a regular schedule, and the last time we revisited it was, I think, last year—sometime last year—and concluded that the test was not met.  As I mentioned at the last briefing, the—you know, the September 26, 2018  assessment was that vulnerabilities were moderate, but it remains a kit—a tool for our toolkit that Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL   we can deploy, you know, when and as we feel appropriate. 

[SECTION]

SAM FLEMING.  Has the chance of needing to deploy it increased?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  As I said, I think I’m in the camp of seeing vulnerabilities as relatively moderate.  I think the financial system—I think another thing that we learned in the crisis is that we need to be alert to the buildup of vulnerabilities as a long expansion continues.  I don’t see that in troubling—troubling amounts at this point, but, you know, I think it’s appropriate for us to monitor that very carefully. European Central Bank this week put out a paper saying that the impact of a trade war on the U.S. could be dire, that the U.S. economy could drop by 2 percent in the first year after a widespread trade war.  Could you talk about the discussion you’ve had—your policy statement, does it mention the trade tensions?  You did not mention them.  What do you—what kind of outlook do you have right now for the trade war? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sure.  So I guess I need to start by saying that we’re not responsible for trade policy, and we don’t comment on particular, you know, trade actions and that sort of thing.  But you will have seen that we have this very extensive network of business contacts around the country through the Reserve Banks largely, and we’ve been hearing a rising chorus of concerns from businesses all over the country about disruption of supply chains,  materials costs and increases, and loss of markets, and things like that.  So we’ve been hearing quite a lot of that, and we—the Reserve Bank presidents talk about it in the meeting, and it goes in the minutes.  So we, you know, that’s—we’re very transparent about hearing all that.  I think if you look at the aggregate perform—the performance of the U.S. economy at an aggregate—at September 26, 2018  a national level, it’s hard to see much happening at this point.  And—or you can look at it the  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL other way:  You can ask, if all of the tariffs that have been announced are applied, what would be the effect at the aggregate level?  And they’re still relatively small. You know, we worry about a couple of things.  One is loss of business confidence, which could reduce investment.  Again, we don’t really see effects that we could measure yet.  Also, the possibility of a financial market reaction over time to unexpected trade developments.  More than anything, though, I would worry, in the longer run, where this is going, you know.  If the— if the end place we get to is lower tariffs, that would be good, you know.  Trade generally supports productivity, supports higher incomes.  And, you know, fair trade—fair trade under internationally accepted rules can be a good thing.  I think if this, perhaps inadvertently, goes to a place where we have widespread tariffs that remain in place for a long time—a more protectionist world—that’s going to be bad for the United States’ economy and for American  workers, and families, and also for other economies. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post.  This is the third time  this year that the FOMC has raised its growth forecasts.  I’m wondering if you could share a little  bit about what’s causing that rise and whether you see supply-side effects coming through from the fiscal policy—fiscal stimulus yet.  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So it’s true.  This year has—we’ve kept raising our forecast for this year.  This—as the year’s gone on, the economy has come in stronger than we expected, and that’s a really good thing.  And the economy, as I mentioned at the beginning, is strong, and there’s good reason to expect that to continue.  You ask why.  You know, some of it is, no doubt, the effect of the fiscal policy changes, the tax cuts, and the spending increases—that’s got to be part of the story.  Part of it may be higher oil prices, which are calling for more investment in the September 26, 2018  oil patch.  But, you know, the growth picture is very much supported by very high readings of Chairman Powell’s Press Conference    FINAL household confidence, business confidence, so it’s a—it’s a—it’s a—it’s a pretty particularly bright moment, I think.  If you look back over the last decade, this is a pretty good moment for the U.S. economy. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  And the supply-side effects? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Oh, supply-side effects, yeah.  So, you know, we hope they’re huge, frankly.  You know, the idea is, you cut—you reduce taxation on corporations and particularly—and allow faster expensing for investment.  The idea is to encourage more  investment, and that is one of the things that drives productivity, which is one of the main things that drives rising incomes.  So the effects are very uncertain, they’re—you know, they’re—the literature is—it’s—there’s no clear answer to exactly how these mechanisms work or how effective they are.  And it would be soon to be seeing supply-side effects.  The other—supply-side effects are probably both more uncertain and they’re probably slower to come in.  But, you know, as I said, we—I certainly hope—I hope that we’ll be marking up our estimates of potential growth as well. 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.  Taking a page from your risk-management approach in Jackson Hole, Mr. Chairman, I’m wondering if you can talk about what risks would make the Committee—plausible risks—go faster in 2019.  What risks would make them go slower?  If you could talk about scenarios.  And then I’d like to ask, do you see yourself, as this stimulus tails off, which it does in the forecast, possibly cutting rates to soft-land the economy?  I know the forecast doesn’t show that, but I’m curious how you soft-land without doing that. September 26, 2018   Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Okay, so I think I mentioned in the opening remarks maybe something that addressed your question about what would make us go faster and slower.  You know, the main thing where we might need to move along a little bit quicker would be if inflation—inflation surprises to the upside.  We don’t see that.  We really don’t see that.  It’s not in our forecast, but any—so I would—I regard that as a risk.  I think either a significant— significant—correction and lasting correction in financial markets or a slowing down in the economy that’s inconsistent with our forecast—those are the kinds of things we’d react to. In terms of what, you know, what we would do—you know, I think we’re always going to be adjusting monetary policy to—in light of conditions on the ground.  So if the economy is weakening, then it’s very possible we’d be—we’d be cutting rates and, you know, vice versa.  And so I can’t rule that out.  It—I think it’s quite difficult, though, to know what the effects— what the sort of end effects of fiscal policy are going to be in 2020.  It’s difficult to know what the policy will be, let alone what their effects will be that far out.  So we have to make estimates, but we know that they’re highly uncertain. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.  Thank you, Chairman.   The unemployment rate is now at 3.9 percent.  The average hourly wages rose 2.9 percent for the past 12 months.  Inflation, according to your numbers, holding steady.  The amount of job  vacancies that we have out there and the number of people coming back into the workforce this  year—where is the point at which, then, we are actually above the natural rate of unemployment and the Federal Reserve should reexamine the consistency of the rate hikes going forward so not to cool an expanding economy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You mean—you mean, where’s the point at which inflation— unemployment is too low?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, so we’ve been—I think the perform—labor September 26, 2018  force participation has surprised us on the upside.  There is a long-run trend there, and we’ve Chairman Powell’s Press Conference    FINAL now had basically five flat years.  If you look—if you look at labor force participation, since the fourth quarter of ’13 till now, you really have a—kind of an oscillation that basically is a sideways movement in the face of a significant downward trend, thanks to aging and other factors.  That’s a gain of well more than a percentage point in participation, so that’s really— that’s really a good thing.  Those are people who are remaining in contact with the labor force and looking for jobs, finding jobs.  So that’s a great thing.  And, by the way, it’s a signal.  It’s one of the things that has allowed the unemployment rate not to fall further.  And it’s a—it’s a signal, too, that there may be more there on the supply side, that there may be more labor supply than the prior trend would indicate.  So it’s a very positive thing to see people staying in the labor force.  And, you know, we don’t know how long it can continue.  We have models, and we look at this—we look at this question all the time.   And, you know, admittedly, we’ve been surprised on the positive side here, so we’re open to the idea that that may continue or not. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Hi, Chair.  Donna Borak with CNN.  Just to follow up on the tariff question, you said earlier that it seems as the effects of the tariff so far haven’t quite materialized—those weren’t your words verbat[im]—but Wal-Mart, Gap, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Macy’s have all said that they expect the tariffs to affect the prices of everyday consumer goods.  So my question is, when—should there be an effect—when would you expect to see that?  And at what point do you start to become worried that it’s actually going to affect  consumer spending and dampening economic growth? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  It’s a concern.  It’s a risk.  You know, so you could see prices moving up.  You don’t see it yet, but we—you could see retail prices moving up.  The tariffs September 26, 2018  might provide a basis for companies to raise prices in a world where they’ve been very reluctant  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   to and unable to raise prices, where raising prices is really difficult, you know, with the ability to shop on the internet.  This could provide, you know, a way for—again, we don’t see it in the numbers.  And, you know, until we see it in the numbers, it’s hard to say how one would react.  And the other question would be, if you’re just talking about the effect on inflation is, is it just a one-time increase in the price level, or is it actually fueling higher inflation going forward?  And that’s a real—that’s an important question in, in how we would think about the appropriate response. kick in, the effect of? 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  But is there a sense of timing, in terms of when you might see that 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Don’t see it yet.  You know, don’t see it yet, but we—you’re hearing—I mean, broadly across the economy, it’s not just tariffs.  You’re hearing—we’re hearing a lot of talk of labor shortages, of material costs in particular industries.  We’re hearing a lot, you know, what amount to supply-side constraints and things like that, but we’re not seeing it.  We’re seeing a sort of modest increase in wages, inflation right around 2 percent, no sense of it moving up really, so we’re not seeing it yet.  And, you know, we just aren’t, and we’re watching very carefully. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television.  Financial conditions are still extremely loose by all the measures that track that.  The flow of funds shows the decline in short-term borrowing other than in Treasuries.  So I’m wondering if that suggests a change in the way that tightening affects the economy.  And along those lines,  you mentioned that you dropped the word “accommodative” doesn’t suggest a change in policy.  But if you’re dropping forward guidance in terms of “accommodative,” does the dot plot really September 26, 2018  serve any purpose anymore if, as you say, you can’t be confident out to 2021 what’s going to  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL happen with the economy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  A couple questions in there.  So the dot plot—I mean, I—it’s not new.  I don’t think it’s a new point that forecasts two and three out—two or three years out are fairly uncertain.  The dot plot is individual FOMC participants who are writing down their individual views on the evolution of the economy and of appropriate monetary policy.  We don’t vote on that.  These are individual forecasts.  I think market participants generally find that  interesting information, and so it seems to me to be serving a purpose. I think the point with “accommodative” was that its useful life was over.  You know, we put that in the statement in 2015, just when we lifted off, and the idea was to provide assurance that we weren’t trying to slow down the economy, but, in fact, we were still—interest rates were still going to be pushing to support economic activity.  Well, that—you know, that purpose has been well served, and the language now doesn’t really say anything that’s important to the way the Committee is thinking about policy going forward.  That’s why that came out.  Did I get— did I get all of your ques—? raised rates 200 basis points? 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  The idea that financial conditions remain loose even though you 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Yeah, you know, it’s—if you look at a broad financial conditions index, that’s pretty much the answer you’ll get.  We don’t control that, and, as I mentioned earlier, we do take financial conditions into account in what we do.  And financial conditions are affecting the broader economy, so, by definition, we’re taking them into account.   But if you look at—look at interest rates, you know, interest rates—look at long-term interest rates this year and short-term interest rates this year, there’s very significant increases.  And, you September 26, 2018  know, with your long and variable lags, that should be—that should be having an effect over  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL time. steam? 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.  So Nellie Liang was just put forward by President Donald Trump to the Fed Board, and I was just curious, you know, given that she’s a longtime veteran of the Fed, whether you could speak to what role you played in, you know, recommending candidates to the President, giving input on who he should nominate.  And then also, if I—if I may follow up on the financial stability discussion from earlier, you know, you’ve mentioned before that corporate debt is at high levels, and I was curious whether, you know, you have any qualms about loosening up restrictions on leveraged lending by making that guidance less of a—less of a cudgel, I guess, while—at a time when leveraged lending is gaining 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Okay, so in terms of nominations to the Fed, those are entirely, completely under the control of the White House and, ultimately, the President.  And traditionally, the Fed Chair has been consulted on those, and I’m happy to say that that has continued.  But these are—these are really decisions for the White House, and, you know, we are—think of us as just being consulted.  I will say that I’m very happy and excited about the team that we’re putting together, and I’m very much looking forward to having those offices up and down our hall filled.  It’s been pretty quiet, more quieter than usual, which is saying something on the Board hall.  So we’re looking forward to getting some people confirmed. In terms of corporate debt, so this is a—this is a—you know, I was an investor for a long time in areas that were very close to the leveraged lending markets.  So, you know, I have had a lot of experience in that.  That market has evolved really significantly since before the crisis.  And, you know, the banks take much less risk than they used to.  They’re—the—they’re September 26, 2018  essentially in the business of distributing these loans and bonds rather than keeping them on their  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   balance sheet, to a much greater degree.  But it’s also true—and there’s significant research on this—that excessive risk-taking in the leveraged lending markets does have channels for affecting the real economy, if there’s overheating and that kind of thing in those markets, so we monitor that carefully.  You know, the guidance is—isn’t binding, as you pointed out, that the leveraged lending isn’t binding, and that’s just—that’s just the way that the law is interpreted.  So it’s something we’re monitoring, and, as I mentioned, we think overall vulnerabilities are moderate.

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.  If I could come back to “accommodative,” do you think of policy as accommodative at present?  How close are you to neutrality, and do you share the view of some of your colleagues that you’ll eventually need to be restrictive? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Okay, so are we accommodative now?  So I think if you look at the—look at the dot plot in the SEP, you’ll see that the federal funds rate, even after today’s move, is below the longer-run neutral estimate of every single participant that—who submits a— an estimate of that.  So that’s why this is the perfect time to take the language out, because, you know, it’s perfectly clear that there can’t be a signal because, you know, by definition, that means an accommodative policy.  So it wasn’t because policy is not accommodative.  It is still   accommodative.  The thinking was more, as I mentioned, it’s more that the language has run its useful life. There’s another point, though, too, which is, you know, we don’t want to suggest either that we have this precise understanding of where “accommodative” stops or suggest that that’s a really important point in our thinking.  You know, what we’re going to be doing, assuming we September 26, 2018  stay on this path, is, we’re going to be carefully monitoring incoming data from the financial  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference    FINAL  we want to achieve—you know, sustain the economy, maximum employment, stable prices.  That’s the way we’re thinking about it, and that does kind of amount to thinking less about one’s precise point estimate of the neutral rate.  So that’s how I think about that. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  The second question was, do you think you’re going to end up in a restrictive posture?  Governor Brainard, for example, has said that she expects that you will need to do that.  Do you agree with that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  It’s possible.  It’s very possible.  It happens often.  And, as I mentioned, many of the participants have written that down, and they’ve written down really modest overshoots, you know, amounting to one rate hike kind of thing, which wouldn’t have a big effect on the economy.  You know, it—I would just say, you know, it really depends on what happens.  It depends on if we keep going—you can think of it different ways.  Maybe we’ve underestimated the neutral rate.  Maybe we’ll be raising our estimate of the neutral rate and we’ll just go to that, or maybe we’ll keep our neutral rate here and then go one or two rate increases beyond it.  I think it’s very possible, but I mean, ultimately, isn’t really the question we’re answering.  The question we’re answering is, how do we provide the economy just the right amount of support— not too much, not too little—to sustain the recovery and achieve our statutory goals?

GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  The 10-year  anniversary of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers got a lot of attention over the last month.  I was wondering if you thought there were any lessons from the crisis that you want to share—and  two points on that.  You go to Congress a lot and talk to members of Congress.  Now, Secretary September 26, 2018  Paulson and Mr. Geithner and Chair Bernanke have said that Congress made a mistake when it  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL took away the Fed’s emergency powers in Dodd-Frank.  And then one other thing is that, are you confident that all these nonbanks didn’t—you know, nonbanks never got put into the, you know, the FSOC, you know, system.  So are you confident that the—you can see the risks in the financial system?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, three things there.  The first thing is the single biggest thing I think that we learned was the—as I mentioned, I think, earlier, the importance of maintaining the stability of the financial system.  So I think if you look—if you look back at the way the models worked and the way people thought about risk in the economy, that’s what was missing, and I think it’s not missing anymore.  So we—you know, we put a tremendous focus on that.  We raised capital, liquidity.  We have stress tests, which force banks to understand—the largest banks particularly—to understand and better manage their risk and have enough capital to survive a really substantial shock that’s at least as bad as the financial crisis.  And if all that doesn’t work, we’ve got resolution plans, which we’ve, you know, through many cycles, have made really substantial progress, more than I had thought was likely.  So we’ve done a lot. Nobody’s—you know, nobody is, I think, overconfident that we’ve solved every problem.  And, you know, now we’re going back and kind of taking a hard look at everything and, you know, trying to make—trying to—trying to keep at it. So I think those are the really important lessons, and, you know, we—we’re determined not to, you know, not to forget them.  And that’s, I think, a risk now—is to—is to forget things that we—that we learned.  That’s just human nature over time. I saw the article you’re talking about; the question is, did Congress take things away, emergency powers from the Fed?  So there was sort of a trade for taking away our power under September 26, 2018  13, section 13(3), to provide support to individual nonbanks, which is really holding companies  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   and other companies.  In exchange for that, we got orderly liquidation authority and a resolution authority.  Was it a mistake?  I don’t think there’s any sense that Congress would seriously look at changing that.  I have real doubts about whether it was wise to take away our crisis-fighting tools.  I think you put them away, and you hope you never need them, but—and I certainly  strongly oppose efforts to take away more of our tools. You know, the third thing you mentioned is the designation power.  So it’s a really important power.  In my mind, it should be used—my thinking, it should be used sparingly, and that means, you know, in situations where you have—I mean, in principle, you could have another Lehman Brothers come up out of the ground that’s not a bank, and it could be very threatening—or it could be capable of creating systemic risk.  And so I think it’s a critical power to have.  But, again, I would use it—I would tend to use it fairly sparingly.

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Are you worried about the effect of rising interest rates on consumers?  Credit card rates have jumped to   more than 17 percent since the Fed started raising interest rates.  Mortgage rates are up.  What do you say to consumers? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Yeah, we look—of course, we look at that very carefully, and interest rates are going up across a broad range of consumer borrowing, as they would when we raise short-term interest rates.  They’re still quite low by historical levels.  And the other thing I’ll say is, take—if you take housing, if you look at the NAR Affordability Index, housing is still more affordable now than it was before the financial crisis.  So you’re right that the cost of borrowing is going up, but it’s going up from what were extraordinarily low levels, and it is  September 26, 2018  something that we watch carefully.  You know, the effect on consumer spending is a very  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL important channel through which interest rates work, and so we do monitor the effects.

HANNAH LANG.  Hi, Hannah Lang, American Banker.  OCC’s decision to go at CRA alone suggests that there’s some sort of disagreement among how to proceed with a joint plan.  What are the issues that are preventing a joint plan from developing, and how close are you to a possible joint plan? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Well, at the Fed, we are, you know, deeply committed to the mission of CRA, which is for banks to provide credit and other banking services in the communities they serve.  And we have also been of the view for some time that with the evolution of technology particularly and changes—changes in the nature of banking, that it’s an appropriate time—it’s past an appropriate time, but now it’s certainly an appropriate time to revisit the way we think about CRA.  But we don’t want to lose that focus on community, and, you know, we definitely want to see that fundamental purpose of the law sustained.  Many of the issues that we had were reflected in the OCC’s ANPR, and we’re—we’re hopeful that, over time, there will be a joint proposed rulemaking with the OCC, the FDIC, and the Fed.  It’s a process, and, you know, we’re very much interested in continuing to push it forward.

STEVE BECKNER.  Steve Beckner, freelance journalist filing for NPR.  Mr. Chairman, following up on the neutral rate issue—and you touched on this—but, you know, you and your colleagues slightly lifted the longer-run estimate, the neutral funds rate estimate to 3 percent, but that’s still, I believe, like 125 basis points below where it was six years ago.  What are the odds that productivity, you know, investment, productivity, labor market, other developments could further push up the longer-run estimate and possibly make the projected funds rate levels less  restrictive than they now seem? September 26, 2018   Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, in principle, the—these starred variables—the long-run growth rate of the economy, the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemployment—don’t move quickly.  They move very gradually.  They’re pinned down by longer-run forces, like demographics.  In the case of the funds rate, it’s more—it’s productivity—it’s appetite for safe assets and demographics and other things, too.  So they move quite slowly through time. I think we all look at them—those of us who file SEPs every quarter will look at that every quarter and not make a change every quarter but, every now and again, make a change.  And you’re right—we actually—the median ticked up a tenth.  It’s a tenth we’re talking about here, so—but still, I think it’s a positive thing that people could be raising their estimates of the longer-run neutral rate and potentially the longer-run growth rate.  Who knows?  And maybe reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which has been the trend.  It’s just that you change those estimates over time.  They’re informed by incoming data.  They don’t change a lot, though, although they did—it’s interesting that the neutral rate changed quite sharply after the financial crisis in many different models, and it’s been slow to recover.  I don’t expect a dramatic recovery there, but, you know, we—we’re so bad at forecasting productivity.  It’s just very hard to know when productivity is going to arrive and in what quantity.  So I think we have to be humble about how little we really know about where these starred value variables either are or are going.

PAUL KIERNAN.  Hi, Chairman.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.  Thank  you for taking the question.  I’d like to just kind of ask again—you mentioned earlier that gradual—a gradual pace of rate increases will make it easier to react.  But, specifically, what are you going to be looking to see, because you’ve also mentioned, you know, that monetary policy operates with a lag, so any kind of specific signposts that maybe we’ve reached the end of the September 26, 2018  tightening cycle or where we should stop?  Secondly, if you worry about the divergence between  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   interest rates in the U.S. and internationally, especially at a time when emerging markets are under pressure.  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sure.  So, you know, some of the things that we’d be looking at to tell us whether we’re getting close to supply-side limits would be, first, does job growth slow down?  A slowing down in job growth would be an indicator, you know.  An unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or inflation could tell you that you’re reaching those points.  You know, if headline growth slowed down, that’s another one.  So all of those things would be worth taking into consideration. other things. I think also, though, we’ve seen sometimes sharp tightening in financial conditions, as we saw at the beginning of 2016, can have a substantial effect pretty quickly on our economy if it’s a broad and significant tightening.  So we would be looking for those kinds of things and many So, in terms of divergence, yes.  So the U.S. economy is, as I mentioned, is strong and is at a pretty positive moment, you know, with strong growth, healthy labor market, inflation right on target, as I mentioned.  So—and we’ve seen growth abroad, but growth, I think, both in advanced economies and in some emerging economies has slowed down a little bit.  And in that world, you know, if the U.S. is stronger, then that’s just part of the context, part of the environment that could mean a higher dollar.  It could be—it could therefore mean that some of our demand will wind up being shared with other economies.  That’s the way the integrated international economy works.  So you could see that, and, you know, it’s just—it’s just all of the—all things that go into thinking about, you know, the path of the economy. September 26, 2018    Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL I would say, you know, we’re not responsible for the dollar.  Of course, the Treasury is responsible for managing the dollar, but the dollar has only partly recovered the decline that it had in 2017.  It’s moved up off its lows, but it’s not as high as it was at the beginning of last year yet by a significant margin.

JEAN YUNG.  Hi.  Jean Yung with Market News International.  Can you give us an update on the technical adjustment in implementing monetary policy that the Fed made earlier  this year when it decoupled the interest on excess reserves rate from the upper bound of the target range?  And have you been happy with that adjustment?  And do you see the need to make another such adjustment in the near future? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So we’ve said that we would use our tools to assure that the federal funds rate trains—trades within the target range.  And the principal tools we use have been interest on excess reserves and then, at the bottom end, a reverse repo facility.  So we—in  raised the range by 25, and that moved federal funds sort of back into the range.  It worked, and  it was successful.  The federal funds rate traded in the low 190s, well within the range. We We think it’s principally a function just of a number of things, but particularly high Treasury supply, and—which is showing up in repo rates and then showing up in fed funds as well.  So we don’t see it as a—as a big problem.  We see it as a problem we can address with our tools, and we’ll use them if we have to. 

[SECTION]

COURTENAY BROWN.  Hi, Chairman.  Courtenay Brown from Axios.  Last month,  the CEA outlined a different way to calculate wage growth.  Has the Fed looked at that at all, and what are you seeing in terms of nonwage-based compensation? September 26, 2018    Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So I wouldn’t comment on a CEA paper, and I would imagine they probably wouldn’t comment on our stuff, either, but I would just say this.  So I am familiar with the question and the work.  You know, we look—we look at a range of indicators of wages, and I think the broader, the better.  You really—in a perfect—a perfect wage measure would also include benefits, because a lot of compensation these days shows up in the form of benefits rather than wages, so I think it’s right to choose those broader ones. But they’re kind of all telling the same story right now.  If you look at the principal four that we look at—we look at a whole range of wage and benefit cost indicators—they are all now showing wages and benefits around 3 percent growth, right?  Clustered around 3 percent.  That’s a full percentage point higher than it was five years ago.  That’s a good thing.  Then the question—the other question is, what about inflation?  You know, if you’re—if you’re looking for real wage increases, you’ve got to ask inflation, and there, you have to pick an inflation measure.  Some people pick CPI.  We, of course, pick personal consumption expenditures because we think it’s a little better measure.  It’s a little broader, and it tends to run a little bit lower as well, but that’s not why we pick it.  We just think it’s more accurate.  And that—the trend there is running around 2 percent, so if wages are running at rough—wages and benefits running at roughly 3 percent and inflation running at around 2 percent.  PCE headline inflation is at 2.3 percent.  PCE core is at about 2, and I think we see that, you know, the temporary increase in headline inflation as being a function of oil prices probably, and we expect inflation to go back down to 2 percent.  So we think of that as 2 percent.  That’s how we think about it.  Is that—I hope that helps.

MYLES UDLAND.  Myles Udland, Yahoo Finance.  Chair Powell, I want to follow up on something you said, actually, at Jackson Hole.  You were talking about longer-term structural September 26, 2018  challenges for the economy, and you mentioned that addressing the federal budget deficit, which  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   has long been on an unsustainable path, becomes increasingly important as a larger share of the population retires.  I’m just wondering if you could, you know, maybe expand on your thoughts  there and if this is an issue that comes up among members of the FOMC at all. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So it doesn’t really come up.  It’s not really our job.  And we do—we do monetary policy.  We regulate financial institutions, financial stability, that sort of thing.  We don’t have responsibility for fiscal policy.  But in the longer-run, fiscal policy will  have a significant effect on the economy, so for that reason, I think my predecessors have  commented on fiscal policy.  But they’ve commented on—at a high level rather than trying to get involved in particular, you know, particular measures.  And so—and I—my plan is to kind of stick to the same approach and stay in our lane. And, you know—so I would just say, it’s—it’s no secret, it’s been true for a long time that with our uniquely expensive health-care delivery system and the aging of our population,  we’ve been on an unsustainable fiscal path for a long time, and there’s no hiding from it.  In the  end, we will have to face that, and I think, you know, the sooner, the better.  And also, these are good times.  These are, you know, this is—this is the economy at nearly full employment or in the range—in the neighborhood of full employment.  Interest rates are low.  It’s a—it’s a good time to be addressing these things.  So I just—I put that out there and leave it at that.

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Well, we serve a domestic mandate, which is assigned to us by Congress, and that is to have maximum employment and stable prices.  About half of global GDP is outside the United States, and way more than half of the growth is outside the United States and in emerging markets, I should say.  And so the performance in the emerging market economies really, really matters to us in carrying out our domestic mandate.  I’d also say that, you know, a strong U.S. economy, where Americans are buying things and the economy is growing and our—you know, that’s going to support demand all around the globe, so that’s a good thing. front. Now, we do understand, though, that when we—when our economy is strong and we’re raising rates, that puts upward pressure on interest rates around the world and can affect countries, particularly countries that have significant external dollar borrowing.  And what we try to do is be very transparent about what we’re doing and why.  And we have been, I believe, and we’ve also moved quite gradually.  So I—you know, I think we’ve been performing well on that There are some countries that are—that are undergoing severe stress, a handful of them, and—but not most emerging market countries.  It’s a relatively small number, and those particular countries have, you know, have particular vulnerabilities, which are well known in the form of budget deficits, and significant external dollar borrowings, and high inflation, and things like that.  So, again, we’ll continue to conduct U.S. monetary policy as transparently as we September 26, 2018  possibly can, and that’s really the best thing we can do, along with supporting U.S. growth.  I’ll  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   just—I think that answers both your questions, actually.

VIRGINIE MONTET.  Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse.  You mentioned earlier a possible, not probable, correction, and I want to come back to the high level of the stock irrational exuberance or rational exuberance?  And if there was a steep correction, would it provoke financial stability concerns? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So I don’t comment on the appropriateness of the level of stock prices.  I can say that by some valuation measures, they’re in the upper range of their historical value ranges.  But, you know, I wouldn’t want to—I wouldn’t want to speculate about what the consequences of a market correction should be.  You know, we would—we would look very carefully at the nature of it, and I mean, it—really—really what hurts is if consumers are borrowing heavily and doing so against, for example, an asset that can fall in value.  So that’s a really serious matter when you have a housing bubble and highly levered consumers and housing values fall.  And we know that that’s a really bad situation.  A simple drop in equity prices is— all by itself, doesn’t really have those features.  It could certainly feature—it could certainly affect consumption and have a negative effect on the economy, though. One thing that’s changed since the crisis is, the majority of mortgages issued last year came from so-called nonbank lenders, as traditional banks scaled back.  What confidence do you have about supervision and, I suppose, also regulation in this space given the role of housing finance in the crisis?  Thank you. September 26, 2018    Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  It’s a good question.  So you’re right that a lot of mortgages are now originated outside the system.  Many of those, though, have to meet certain basic standards to be bought by the GSEs.  I think we—if we look at mortgage credit more broadly, though, what we see is that credit is pretty widely available to people with high scores and with good credit— good credit records, and much, much less available than it was before the crisis to people with low scores and perhaps troubled credit history.  You know, it’s—have we—have we set—have we got that exactly right?  I don’t know.  I mean, I—but that’s clearly—that’s the reality.  In  terms of those institutions, they do have supervision by the CFPB and other state regulators.  But you’re right.  They’re much—much of the origination process has moved outside the banking  system, and it’s something we monitor. ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
23,2018-12-19,"CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Good afternoon, everyone.  Thanks very much for being here today.  [Cough]  Pardon me.   Over the past year the economy has been growing at a strong pace, the unemployment  rate has been near record lows, and inflation has been low and stable.  All of those things remain true today.  Since the September meeting of the FOMC, however, some crosscurrents have emerged.  I’ll explain how my colleagues and I are incorporating those crosscurrents into our judgments about the outlook and the appropriate course of policy. Since September, the U.S. economy has continued to perform well, roughly in line with our expectations.  The economy has been adding jobs at a pace that will continue bringing the unemployment rate down over time.  Wages have moved up for workers across a wide range of occupations—a welcome development.  Inflation has remained low and stable and is ending the year a bit more subdued than most had expected.  Although some American families and communities continue to struggle and some longer-term economic problems remain, the strong   economy is benefiting many Americans. Despite this robust economic backdrop and our expectation for healthy growth, we have seen developments that may signal some softening relative to what we were expecting a few months ago.  Growth in other economies around the world has moderated somewhat over the course of 2018, albeit to still-solid levels.  At the same time, financial market volatility has increased over the past couple of months, and overall financial conditions have tightened—that is, they have become less supportive of growth. In our view, these developments have not fundamentally altered the outlook.  Most FOMC participants have, instead, modestly lowered their growth and inflation forecasts for next  December 19, 2018  year.  The projections of Committee participants released today show growth continuing at Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL healthy levels, the unemployment rate falling a bit further next year, and inflation remaining near 2 percent.  The projections also show a modestly lower path for the federal funds rate, which should support the economy and keep us near our goals.  As the economy struggled to recover from the financial crisis and the subsequent recession, the Committee held our policy rate near zero for seven years to give the economy the best chance to recover.  And the economy did recover steadily, if slowly at times. Three years ago the Committee came to the view that the best way to achieve our mandate was to gradually move interest rates back to levels that are more normal in a healthy economy.  Today we raised our target range for the short-term interest rates by another ¼ percentage point.  As I’ve mentioned, most of my colleagues expect the economy to continue to perform well in the coming year.  Many FOMC participants had expected that economic  conditions would likely call for about three more rate increases in 2019.  We have brought that down a bit and now think it is more likely that the economy will grow in a way that will call for  two interest rate increases over the course of next year. We always emphasize that our policy decisions are not on a preset course and will change if the incoming data materially change the outlook.  And, given recent developments, the statement notes that we “will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook.” Now I will provide some additional context and detail, starting with a review of policy over the last year.  Last December, the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, and inflation had been running just below 2 percent.  FOMC participants and many other forecasters were predicting that growth in 2018 would be strong.  This growth was predicted to push the  December 19, 2018  unemployment rate down to near historic lows, and the increasingly tight labor market was Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL expected to help push inflation up to 2 percent. Given this outlook, Committee members judged that the appropriate way to sustain the expansion with inflation near 2 percent was to continue gradually withdrawing the extraordinary support for the economy that had been in place for almost 10 years.  Thus, in December 2017,  the median of the projections of FOMC participants pointed to three ¼ point interest rate increases in 2018, which would have left the target range for the federal funds rate at year-end at  2 to 2¼ percent, still below most estimates of the longer-run normal rate. Early in 2018, it became clear that the economy was likely to be even stronger than we had expected, in part because the fiscal stimulus adopted near the start of the year was larger and more front-end loaded than most had anticipated.  The signs of a more robust economy proved accurate, and the FOMC has now raised rates four times this year, counting today’s action, one  more time than anticipated in the median projection a year ago. This illustrates the nature of data dependence that we always emphasize.  In 2018, the economy was somewhat more robust than expected, and this led to a slightly faster pace of policy normalization than had been projected.  When the economy has, instead, turned out weaker than expected, the Committee has slowed or paused the pace of rate increases as we did in 2016.  And when the economy has performed about as expected, the Committee has generally moved in line with the median projection as we did in 2017. What kind of year will 2019 be?  We know that the economy may not be as kind to our forecasts next year as it was this year.  History attests that unforeseen events as the year unfolds  released today.  December 19, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL With that caveat, there are two important differences in the policy outlook today versus next year.  In early 2018, we saw a rising trajectory for growth; today, instead, we see growth moderating ahead.  FOMC participants, along with many other forecasters, had long predicted some moderation of growth in 2019.  The additional tightening of financial conditions we have seen over the past couple of months along with signs of somewhat weaker growth abroad have also led us to mark down growth and inflation projections a bit.  The median of FOMC participants’ projections shows growth of 3 percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2019.  With growth remaining next year above its longer-run normal value, the unemployment rate is projected to fall a bit further, to 3.5 percent by the end of 2019.  Inflation in the median projection remains near 2 percent. Second, the economy has continued to strengthen this year.  And, given our four rate increases and the ongoing reduction in our portfolio, monetary policy will be providing a smaller boost to the economy in 2019.  After today’s action, the target range for the federal funds rate is 2¼ to 2½ percent, putting it at the lower end of the range of estimates of the longer-run normal  rate provided by the Committee. Over the next year, if events play out broadly as expected, the federal funds rate will be in a range in which judgments of people both inside and outside the Fed will sometimes differ regarding whether the stance of policy is modestly accommodative, neutral, or modestly restrictive.  When rates are in this range, the FOMC makes policy in light of the array of diverse  views on the Committee.  Moving forward, my colleagues and I will be watching the economy  closely for indications that the stance of policy is appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near 2 percent.  December 19, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL It is worth noting that the Summary of Economic Projections is a compilation of the individual projections of all FOMC participants.  We sometimes point to the median of these projections to illustrate the broad middle of views of the Committee.  Each participant’s projection represents appropriate policy under the baseline outlook—baseline outlook provided by that participant.  We believe that the SEP provides useful information about Committee participants’ thinking, but the median is not a consensus judgment and certainly does not represent a Committee plan.  Actual policy will, as always, be adjusted as incoming data shed light on the state of the economy, the outlook, and the changing balance of risks. Neither the pace nor the ultimate destination of any further rate increases is predetermined.  We will adjust monetary policy as best we can to keep the expansion on track, the labor market strong, and inflation near 2 percent.  We know that our policy decisions affect all American families and businesses, and we’ll continue to make our decisions objectively and based solely on the best information and analysis.  Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions.

SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.  One of  the recent surprises has been fairly tepid inflation data.  I wonder, first of all, if you could explain why you think, despite the extremely tight labor market, we’re still not seeing much in the way of inflationary pressures.  And in the context of a more data-dependent Fed, how will the Fed respond to further undershoots of inflation moving into next year?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Well, you’re right, Sam.  Inflation has come in just a touch  below where we expected it to be—not by a big amount, but by a small amount.  More broadly, 2018 has been the strongest year since the recov—since the financial crisis.  And during that period we’ve had low unemployment and strong growth, and inflation has still remained just a  December 19, 2018  touch below 2 percent.  So I do think that gives the Committee the ability to be patient in moving Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL forward.  As I mentioned, there’s significant uncertainty about the—both the path and the  ultimate destination of any further rate increases. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post.  Today, the Fed  lowered its expectations for interest rate increases.  Given that, I’m wondering if the Fed has had any discussion of altering the course of balance sheet normalization and if you could give us any insight on what might lead the FOMC to alter that balance sheet normalization in 2019. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sure.  If you go back some years, I think we—people who were working at the Fed in 2013 and ’14 took away the lesson that the markets could be very sensitive to news about the size of the balance sheet, the pace of asset purchases, the pace of runoff, and things like that.  So we thought carefully about this, on how to normalize policy, and came to the view that we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on automatic pilot and use monetary policy, rate policy, to adjust to incoming data. And I think that has been a good decision.  I think that the runoff of the balance sheet has been smooth and has served its purpose.  And I don’t see us changing that.  And I do think that we will continue to use monetary policy, which is to say rate policy, as the active tool of monetary policy. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chairman Powell, you talked a little bit earlier about the ability to be patient.  And so as you think about your next policy moves, are you inclined to go at the current recent pace to a slightly different destination that’s laid out in the projections today?  Or does the current environment of restrained inflation maybe allow you to space out your next few moves and take more time to  get there?  December 19, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, as background, I would just point to 2018 being a very strong year and the Committee looking forward to 2019 and still having what amounts to a positive forecast.  We still are forecasting, individually, growth a bit above its longer-run potential—2.3 percent is what we’re forecasting.  We’re forecasting that growth will be strong enough that unemployment will drop still further and inflation will remain right near our target.   So I’d say that’s a reasonably positive forecast. Going forward, you know, I will be looking, in particular, to see whether incoming data tell us that we’re, in fact, on that path, that development of the economy is in line with that expectation.  That will be the main thing.  More broadly, though, I think we’ve reached the bottom end of the range of Committee estimates of what might be neutral.  I think, from this  point forward, we’re going to be letting the data speak to us and form the outlook and inform our  understanding of what would be appropriate policy.  So there’s a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path and the ultimate destination of any further increases. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Could you tell us how three things affected the outlook for the economy and rates?  The first is how the market’s decline affected the outlook for the economy and for rates.  The second is trade tensions and the tariff, or how you factor that into your outlook.  And the third is comments by the President urging you not to hike rates. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, as I mentioned, we monitor a broad range of economic conditions, including financial conditions—a broad range of financial conditions.  And we took on board the tightening in financial conditions, which—not any one condition, but, broadly  speaking, financial conditions have tightened since the September meeting, really.  So we took that on board in our forecast.  That’s why the forecast for growth and inflation went down a little  December 19, 2018  bit.  But, remember, that’s in a context of a more accommodative path.  So we also took down Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL our rate forecast.  So we definitely did take that into account, and, as you can see from the statement language, we acknowledged those risks in the clause about monitoring developments.  And we’re going to be watching carefully to see as those things develop. I think, more broadly, there’s been a sense of concern among business people and market people about global growth, and, you know, that may be partly about trade tensions, it may be partly about a variety of things.  If you just mechanically drop into a model of the U.S. economy tariffs, you don’t see very large effects.  The large effects would have to come from financial   difficult to model. On your third factor, you know, political considerations have played no role whatsoever in our discussions or decisions about monetary policy.  We’re always going to be focused on the mission that Congress has given us.  We have the tools to carry it about.  We have the independence, which we think is essential to be able to do our jobs in a nonpolitical way.  And you know, we are—we at the Fed are absolutely committed to that mission, and nothing will deter us from doing what we think is the right thing to do. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.  You’re about to undershoot your inflation target for the seventh straight year.  Your new forecasts say that you’re going to undershoot it for the eighth straight year.  Should we interpret the dot plot as suggesting that some members of your Committee believe that policy should be in a restrictive range by the end of next year?  If so, can you help us to understand why people would be advocating  restrictive monetary policy at a time of persistent inflation undershoots?  December 19, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Well, we—as a Committee, we do not desire inflation undershoots.  And you’re right, inflation has continued to surprise to the downside—not by a lot, though.  I think we’re very close to 2 percent, and, you know, we do believe it’s a symmetric goal for us.  Inflation is symmetric around 2 percent, and that’s how we’re going to look at it.  We’re not trying to be under 2 percent.  We’re trying to be symmetrically around 2 percent.  And I don’t—you know, I’ve never said that I feel like we’ve achieved that goal yet.  The only way to achieve inflation symmetrically around 2 percent is to have inflation symmetrically around 2 percent, and we’ve been close to that but we haven’t gotten there yet, and we have not declared victory on that.  So that remains to be accomplished. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Jeanna Smialek, Bloomberg News.  Just following up on Binya’s question—I guess if you haven’t achieved 2 percent inflation and you don’t see an overshoot, which would be sort of implied by a symmetrical target, what’s the point in raising rates again at all? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, again, I go back to the health of the economy.  If you look at 2018, as I mentioned, this the best year since the financial crisis.  You’ve had growth well above trend.  You’ve got unemployment dropping.  You’ve got inflation moving up to 2 percent.  And we also have a positive forecast, as I mentioned, and, in that context, we think this move was appropriate for what is a very healthy economy. Policy at this point does not need to be accommodative.  It can move to neutral.  It seems appropriate that it be neutral.  We’re now at the bottom end of the range of estimates of neutral.   So that’s the basis upon which we made the decision.  I also think we took on board, you know, the risks to that, and, you know, we’re certainly cognizant of them.  December 19, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL established for this coming year a communications panel to look at how the Fed communicates.  Could you talk a little bit about what you expect to get from that panel, and will the dot plot be involved in that at all?  How do you think the dot plot is working?  Are we dealing with it the way that you want us to be handling the dot plot, or is it something that you might tweak a bit? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So this review, what it really is—it’s coming at a time when the economy is strong, and it’s a good time to take a step back, we think, and ask whether our strategy and our tools and our communications around monetary policy are doing the job that Congress has assigned us to do on behalf of the American people.  And what we’re going to do is, we’re going to open ourselves up and have a discussion with many outside groups of all different parts of the economy, including, you know, an academic conference in June in Chicago. And, again, the idea is to, you know, listen to new ideas, better ideas, old ideas—many of  them have been around—and try to assess whether there are better ways we can do things.  One of the overarching facts is that rates have been really coming down overall for more than three therefore, we’ll have less policy space to react to economic downturns.  And we’d want to be evaluating ideas for—again, for better achieving the goals that Congress has given us. We’re not looking at law changes at all, and we’re not looking at changing the inflation target, for example.  We are looking for better ways to achieve the inflation goal—for example, on a symmetric basis.  So that’s the sense of that. As I mentioned, on the dot plot—you asked about the dot plot.  I think the dot plot generally does provide useful information about the reaction function of Committee participants—sometimes more useful than others, I’ll admit.  But, in general, I think people sort  December 19, 2018  of have it figured out and understand what it is and what it isn’t.  But that doesn’t mean we don’t Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL like to repeat what it isn’t, which—it’s not a consensus forecast.  It’s not something that we vote on.  It’s something that each of us writes down, and we always update it as—you know, as data come in and as we update our outlooks. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  The balance sheet reduction—how much additional tightening do you think has come from that?  We  know in the markets that the cost of credit rising, commercial paper, repo rates, the TED spread widening—do you see any concerns about the availability or the price of credit that could slow the markets?  And if, in 2019, we see the economy start to slow, would you, if you don’t adjust the balance sheet, be risking too much tightening? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So we do watch all of that, but the amount of—the amount of runoff that we’ve had so far is pretty small.  And if you just run the quantitative easing models in reverse, you would get a pretty small adjustment in economic growth and real outcomes.  So we don’t think, you know, things that are happening at the short run—at the short end—are driven by many other factors other than the balance sheet runoff.  For example, just—very large bill supply has pushed up short-term rates, has pushed up repo rates.  Tightening of the federal funds  rate has raised short-term borrowing costs.  So, you know, we’re alert to these issues.  We’re watching them carefully.  But we don’t see, you know, the balance sheet runoff as creating  significant problems. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Hi, Edward Lawrence, Fox Business Network.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We’ve seen enormous volatility in the markets recently.  We know the President said, you know, don’t raise interest rates.  It’s well documented.  The National Association of Realtors’ chief economist says that it’s starting to affect first-time homebuyers with the mortgage  December 19, 2018  rates going up.  When do you think these pauses need to come in next year?  Do we need to keep Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL this, as you say, gradual?  And then, in addition, what data are you specifically looking at for you that shows when the Federal Reserve starts to become that headwind in the economy with the  rates? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, we’re watching—we have a strong forecast, generally, for next year.  That forecast involves growth, you know, between 2 and 2½ percent.  It involves growth at a strong enough level to continue driving unemployment down and inflation near 2 percent.  So that’s a pretty positive forecast.  So, to make further moves, I’ll be looking  for data that suggests that that’s, in fact, the path that we’re on. As I mentioned, once you—once you’re, broadly speaking, in the range of neutral, I think it’s appropriate to be putting aside individual estimates of that and be looking at what the incoming data are telling you about the outlook, updating your estimates of what neutral might be, of what the natural rate of unemployment might be, of the state of the economy, so—and letting that lead you to adjust your outlook and, therefore, your appropriate path for policy.  So that’s what we mean when we say we’re “data dependent.”  Of course, we’re always data dependent, but I think it has a particular meaning in this context, which is that. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  I wanted to ask, first of all, whether you’re worried that President Trump’s tweeting and statements might interfere with your ability to communicate with markets and why you’re doing what you’re doing.  And then, also, I was wondering if you could comment on—Governor Brainard gave a speech recently where she laid out the case for the countercyclical capital buffer being activated.  Do you disagree with her analysis?  Is that something that you think the Fed should look at doing?  December 19, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I’m not worried, because—about—on the first question— because I know, and everyone who works at the Fed knows, that we’re going to do our jobs the way we’ve always done them.  And that involves, you know, I think getting the best thinking together, diverse perspectives.  We—every business—every FOMC cycle, we talk to hundreds of  people in all different parts of society, not just business people or market people, but people from community development organizations.  We get survey data from thousands of people, and so we  really do have a pretty broad exposure to what’s going on in all different parts of the country.  And we’re going to take all that information, and we’re going to make the best decisions we can, and nothing will cause us to deviate from that. In terms of the CCyB, so the CCyB is—the countercyclical capital buffer is a tool that allows us to build capital at a time when vulnerabilities—financial stability vulnerabilities—are meaningfully above normal.  And so that’s a tool I’d be absolutely willing to use and happy to  use at such time as that test is met.  We meet and discuss that and evaluate it on roughly an annual basis.  We haven’t done it since early this year.  I think we’ll be doing it early next year, and we’ll be reaching that judgment then.  I will tell you, I recently gave a speech saying that I believe that financial stability vulnerabilities were roughly at a moderate level.  So, for me, that—but I would want to leave open—my mind open on that and have that discussion with my Board colleagues when the issue arises. 

[SECTION]

ANN SAPHIR.  Ann Saphir with Reuters.  You said that policy does not need, at this point, to be accommodative.  But does it need to be restrictive, as the dots seem to suggest that it 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Does it currently need to be restrictive?  No.  And I don’t believe that it is.  I don’t believe that policy is restrictive. will be?  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

ANN SAPHIR.  Next year.  The dots suggest it will be restrictive next year.  Should  it be? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Yeah, I—I’ve discussed this a couple of times.  It’s a very good question.  And I guess I would just go back to this:  The individual forecasts are not something that the Committee votes on.  They’re out in the future.  We vote on the rate increase, and we write down our—you know, our own personal paths.  So people have disparate views on what the endpoint could be. Ultimately, it’s going to depend on what the circumstances are.  There would be circumstances in which it would be appropriate to go past neutral, and there would be circumstances in which it would be wholly inappropriate to do so.  So I don’t—I wouldn’t put too much on—it does inform you, the way people are thinking about things.  But don’t—I wouldn’t take it as a signal about current policy or about near-term policy. 

[SECTION]

PAUL KIERNAN.  Hi, Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.  Thanks for the  question.  In Dallas last month you talked about the usefulness of speaking with businesses, sometimes hearing things that aren’t yet showing up in the economic data.  And I was just wondering if you’re hearing anything from businesses that might explain the recent market   moves.  You know, are markets on to something that, again, hasn’t showed up yet in the data? Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, if you look at the Tealbook, or—you know, we get the Tealbook in person from the Reserve Bank presidents who come in, and they share their  discussions not just with their directors, but with literally hundreds of business and nonprofit, you know, and labor union people around the country.1  And I personally find it really                                                   1 Chairman Powell was referring to the Beige Book, not the Tealbook.     December 19, 2018  interesting.  My background is very much working—starting with, you know, a small group of Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL people, maybe a company, and working out.  So that kind of anecdotal data really helps me  capture the picture better. So—and, you know, what—what you’re picking up now, I think, is, there’s, you know, a mood of concern, or it’s a mood of angst about growth going forward, if I could just capture it in one thought.  There are many reasons that are given for that, but, generally speaking, it’s—it’s a concern about, is growth going to be as strong as it was?  Why not?  What might it be—to different people?  But that mood is out there.  That doesn’t mean that it’ll come into the real data in a big way—it may, but—or that financial conditions will tighten further.  We’ll just have to see.  For now, financial conditions have tightened a little bit.  We’ve taken that on board both in the outcomes, in our forecast, but also in a lower rate path to—you know, to provide some accommodation to push back against that tightening.  That’s how I think about it. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Just following up on Paul’s question—  President Trump said recently that you should feel the markets.  So when you see the markets, you know, what are the markets telling you? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, financial conditions—broadly speaking, we don’t look at any one market.  We look at a really big range of financial conditions.  And what matters for the broader economy is material changes in a broad range of financial conditions that are  sustained for a period of time.  A little bit of volatility—speaking in the abstract—some volatility doesn’t probably leave a mark on the economy.  So we look for that. And, you know, what we’ve seen here is a tightening.  There’s been a tightening since right around after—a week or so after the September meeting.  And, you know, that—we tried to factor that into our models of the economy and to the results that come out of those models.   December 19, 2018  That’s how we think about it.  So we do, you know—we follow markets really carefully.  But, Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL remember, from a macroeconomic standpoint, no one market is the single dominant indicator  and it really matters if changes are sustained over time. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Do you still think core PCE is a good measure of whether the economy is overheating?  What do you think of other measures like setting a target for economic growth and relying more on that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Well, I think we look at both, but core PCE is a good indicator.  It has—what’s happened over, really, 50 years is that inflation has become much less reactive to  changes in growth.  There was a time when inflation reacted really quickly to changes in growth and changes in unemployment, and that time is behind us.  And that is often attributed to the success of central banks in anchoring inflation expectations so that people believe that inflation will come back to the target or around the target so it doesn’t go down as much—inflation doesn’t go down as much in a downturn and doesn’t go up as much when the—you know, when the economy is strong. It’s really true, though, that inflation has not reacted a lot on a road from 10 percent   unemployment to now 3.7 percent unemployment.  Now, it did move up last year.  But in terms of just targeting growth, you know, I think—I actually think our dual mandate works very well, which is maximum employment and stable prices.  Most of the time, those two things work together.  When they work temporarily in different ways, we take a balanced approach.  But I think that approach has served us well, and I think we can work well with it. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN.  Next year, every meeting will be a live meeting.  So, presumably, there will be some adjustment in how the  December 19, 2018  communicating those potential policy moves, especially in light of the fact of the tremendous Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL amount of uncertainty going into next year? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I think having regular press conferences will be a big gain for communication.  I certainly hope it will.  That’s the plan.  And so, being able to come out after each meeting and explain the Committee’s thinking and relate that to the state of the economy  and expectations for policy and global developments, I think it’ll be—the idea is that it’ll be helpful in explaining how we’re thinking and, you know, explaining what we’re thinking about policy going forward.  So that’s the plan.  I do believe it will be a positive development. I think it’ll also become the case, over time, that there will be no “prior” as to whether we would move at a quarterly meeting or one of the meetings at which we do not file an SEP.  As you know, we only update our projections under the current approach quarterly, whereas we have eight—eight meetings.  So I think we’ll move to a more—we’ll have the ability to move eight—at eight different meetings.  Not eight times, but at eight different meetings on the year. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  I guess that’s sort of the question that I’m trying to drive at is, in terms of communicating to the market, because we’ve been—the market’s been so adjusted to the fact that these are quarter-end rate hikes, and now you have the potential to move eight times a year—is the Fed thinking through how it’s going to communicate when it plans, especially given the amount of uncertainty? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Yes.  I mean, I think that’s probably pretty straightforward.  If we, you know—if we’re—if we want to communicate something about something that’s going to happen in a future meeting, I think we know how to do that in speeches, in press conferences, and such.  December 19, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times.  You mentioned broad-based wage gains this year, and I’m wondering if you see further acceleration in wage growth and just how much slack there is in the labor market. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So what we’ve seen is, is a very gradual—and, I think, ongoing—increase in wages.  If you go back a few years, you’ll see that we look at many, many indicators of wages and compensation.  But there are four principal ones.  And they were all kind of clustered around 2—if you go back five years ago—2 percent increase per year.  Now they are all at 3, and they’ve just continued to gradually move up—not perfectly in sync, but—and that’s a number that is, you know, right in keeping with 2 percent inflation and 1 percent productivity growth.  So in an economic sense, it makes sense. I do expect, and I think many forecasters expect, that wage increases will continue, and  that would be a welcome development.  Wage—wage increases do not need to be inflationary.  There’s plenty of evidence of situations—for example, in the very tight labor market of the late 1990s of a—I think I mentioned in a speech a month or so ago, we had wage increases above productivity plus inflation, and we didn’t have high inflation.  So it would be welcome.  We hear a great deal of anecdotal information about labor shortages, along with other, you know, bottlenecks and things.  So I would expect that wages will keep moving up, and it doesn’t necessarily mean inflation.  We don’t think of it that way.  So did that answer your question? 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Labor slack? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Labor slack.  Yes.  So, you know, by most indicators—we look at a very wide range of indicators on the labor market.  And, by most indicators, we are at or even above longer-run normal levels.  But I would point to one particular pocket, and that is, labor force participation by younger prime-age workers, particularly prime-age males, is still,  December 19, 2018  you know, meaningfully below its pre-crisis level.  Most other age groups in both genders have Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL moved back up pretty close to where they were at the last cyclical peak.  You know, there’s a question, can we go above that cyclical peak?  And—or, or are the problems more structural than cyclical, and that there isn’t—so we’ll have to find that out.  I think, given the strong economy, we’ve had the luxury of finding out that labor force participation can be higher than we had thought.  And that’s nothing but a good thing. 

[SECTION]

JOHN HELTMAN.  Hi, John Heltman with American Banker.  A regulatory question, if I focused on banks in the sort of medium-to-small range.  That is, a sort of tailoring enhanced prudential standards, particularly for those banks, and I’m thinking of the stress capital buffer as  well as the most recent proposal on banks between $100 and $250 billion. G-SIBs and the largest banks seem to be sort of left out in a lot of these proposals, and I’m wondering if that is meant to send a message that the Fed does not really intend to change its regulatory structure for the largest banks going forward, or if you’ll get to that maybe later.  And I’m thinking specifically of the G-SIB capital surcharge, which several members of Congress have sent letters to you asking you to revisit and reconsider. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So you’re right that a big focus of what we have been doing has been tailoring regulations.  And the sense of “tailoring” is that we want to look below the level of the G-SIBs at the large regionals and then on down to the community banks at various steps and ask whether we have appropriately tailored regulation and supervision to account for the fact that smaller and less complex organizations present a much less significant threat to the economy and to the community should they fail—should they experience material difficulty.  So,  in the nature of that, you’re focused more on the smaller institutions.  December 19, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL I think, with the larger institutions, we want regulation and supervision to be effective  and efficient.  I know that the larger institutions tend to be the ones who care about the Volcker rule.  That’s something we’re working on.  You know, we—we think that things need to be looked at carefully.  And, again, I wouldn’t want to materially change capital levels, because, I think, you know, it’s important that the largest financial institutions, the largest and most complex—the systemically important ones be held to the highest standards and higher expectations.  And while we may tailor some regulations, those fundamentally high expectations are not going to change. 

[SECTION]

STEVEN BECKNER.  Steve Beckner, freelance financial journalist reporting for NPR, Chairman Powell.  I know you look at many different financial indicators, but let me focus your attention briefly on bond yields.  The 10-year note yield has gone down pretty steeply, roughly 50 basis points, I think, in recent weeks.  I wonder what you make of it.  Is it a worrisome sign for you in terms of the outlook for growth, for inflation?  On the other hand, could it be a positive, in terms of presumably bringing down mortgage rates and helping the housing sector? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Again, we do focus on a broad range of financial indicators, and I—really, we don’t obsess about any particular one.  You know, we look at a whole range of them, and we ask ourselves, what’s really going on in the broad picture out there?  You know, if you ask what’s going on with the long—certainly the long, longer-maturity Treasury market has come in some.  That’s consistent with, you know, a risk-off feeling in the stock market as well.  And, you know, we don’t know whether that’ll persist.  Really, the longer Treasury has moved in a range above 3 percent and down 3 percent as the risk sentiment has changed.  You know, I think if rates were to stay low for a longer period of time, that could be thought of as a signal of expectations of lower growth.  But, you know, we don’t know that that’ll happen.  As I  December 19, 2018  mentioned, our forecast for next year is—I think, in keeping with most other forecasts—is that Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL we’ll still have solid growth next year, declining unemployment, and a healthy economy.

COURTENAY BROWN.  Hi, Chairman, Courtenay Brown from Axios.  I’m wondering   if you could clear up what’s become a little bit of a debate in the financial community.  You said in October in an interview with PBS that interest rates were a long way from neutral.  A month later you said interest rates were just below neutral.  And I think a lot of people interpreted that as a shift in tone from you.  Were they right to interpret it that way? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, monetary policy is a forward-looking exercise, and I’m going to—I’m just going to stick with that.  It’s—where we are right now is, we’re at the lower end of the range of neutral.  We’ve arrived effectively at the bottom end of that range.   And, you know, there are implications of that.  For that, as I mentioned, going forward, there’s real uncertainty about the path—the pace, rather, and the destination for further rate increases.  And we’re going to be letting incoming data inform our thinking about the appropriate path. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE FLEURY.  Michelle Fleury, BBC News.  Chairman Powell, you talked about monitoring global developments.  I was wondering, you touched on trade, the trade dispute with China.  But could you elaborate on what economic developments you’re referring to, whether Brexit is one of those?  What else? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  More broadly, I’m referring to global growth.  So, if you go back a year, 2017 was a year of kind of ongoing upside surprises in global growth.  It was the year of synchronized global growth.  And people raised their forecasts for growth around the world kind of throughout 2017 and, in some sense, expected that to continue into 2018.  What has happened instead has been a modest retracing of that.  So you have still healthy levels of growth in the aggregate around the world but close to the potential growth rate of, you know, the  December 19, 2018  global economy.  But you no longer have the really strong levels of growth you had in 2017.  So Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL that is one—that’s, I think, the key fact. We also monitor, you know, event risks like Brexit—like, you know, like the  negotiations between Italy and the EU over their budget.  And, you know, as far as those are concerned, we monitor them very carefully.  And I’m going to—I’ll mention Brexit.  Our financial institutions have had a long time now to get ready for the full range of possible exits  from the EU by the U.K.  And they’ve had supervisory involvement from U.S. supervisors, from U.K. supervisors, from EU supervisors—we think they are fully prepared for the full range of  outcomes that may come out of that.  I was very happy to see the developments around central counterparties today.  That was a big issue that seems to have been satisfactorily, for the time being, resolved.  So it’s something we’re watching carefully.  Honestly, it shouldn’t have major implications for the United States, but, you know, there’s a lot of uncertainty because it’s not something that’s happened before.  So we’ll be watching it carefully.  Thanks very much.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
24,2019-01-30,"CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome.  I will start with a recap of our discussions, including our assessment of the outlook for the economy and the judgments we made about our interest rate policy and our balance sheet.  I will cover the make decisions in coming meetings. My colleagues and I have one overarching goal:  to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people.  The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there.  The jobs picture continues to be strong, with the unemployment rate near historic lows and with stronger wage gains.  Inflation remains near our 2 percent goal.  We continue to expect that the American economy will grow at a solid pace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong pace of 2018.  We believe that our current policy stance is appropriate at this time. Despite this positive outlook, over the past few months we have seen some crosscurrents and conflicting signals about the outlook.  Growth has slowed in some major foreign economies, particularly in China and Europe.  There is elevated uncertainty around several unresolved government policy issues, including Brexit, ongoing trade negotiations, and the effects from the partial government shutdown in the United States.  Financial conditions tightened considerably late in 2018 and remain less supportive of growth than they were earlier in 2018.  And, while most of the incoming domestic economic data have been solid, some surveys of business and consumer sentiment have moved lower, giving reason for caution. January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL We always emphasize that our policies are data dependent.  In other words, as economic conditions and the outlook evolve, we take that new information into account in setting our policies.  We are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong U.S. macroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of crosscurrents.  At such times, common-sense risk management suggests patiently awaiting greater clarity—an approach that has served policymakers well in the past.  With that in mind, I’d like to spell out how the Federal Open Market Committee has been thinking about these issues. At our December meeting, we noted the solid outlook for steady growth, vigorous job creation, and price stability.  We also stressed that the extent and timing of any rate increases were uncertain and would depend on incoming data and the evolving outlook.  We therefore said that we would be paying close attention to global economic and financial developments and assessing their implications for the economic outlook. Today the FOMC decided that the cumulative effects of those developments over the last several months warrant a patient, wait-and-see approach regarding future policy changes.  In particular, our statement today says, “In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate.” This change was not driven by a major shift in the baseline outlook for the economy.  Like many forecasters, we still see “sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor mentioned suggest the risk of a less favorable outlook.  In addition, the case for raising rates has weakened somewhat.  The traditional case for rate increases is to protect the economy from risks that arise when rates are too low for too long, particularly the risk of too-high inflation.  Over the January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL past few months, that risk appears to have diminished.  Inflation readings have been muted, and the recent drop in oil prices is likely to push headline inflation lower still in coming months.  Further, as we noted in our postmeeting statement, while survey-based measures of inflation expectations have been stable, financial market measures of inflation compensation have moved lower.  Similarly, the balance—the risk of financial imbalances appears to have receded, as a number of indicators that showed elevated levels of financial risk appetite last fall have moved closer to historical norms.  In this environment, we believe we can best support the economy by being patient in evaluating the outlook before making any future adjustment to policy. Let me now turn to balance sheet normalization.  Over its past three meetings, the FOMC has held in-depth discussions on the final stages of this process.  Today we made some important progress in clarifying the path forward, as summarized in the Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization that we released with today’s FOMC statement. The Committee made the fundamental decision today to continue indefinitely using our current operating procedure for implementing monetary policy.  That is, we will continue to use our administered rates to control the policy rate with an ample supply of reserves so that active management of reserves is not required.  This is often called a “floor system” or an “abundant reserves system.”  Under the current set of operating procedures, as outlined in the implementation note released today, this means that the federal funds rate, our active policy tool, is held within its target range by appropriately setting the Federal Reserve’s administered rates of interest on reserves, as well as the offer rate on the overnight reverse repo facility, without managing the supply of reserves actively.  As the minutes of our recent discussions have indicated, the FOMC strongly believes that this approach provides good control of short-term January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL money market rates in a variety of market conditions and effective transmission of those rates to broader financial conditions. Settling this central question clears the way for the FOMC to address a number of further questions regarding the remaining stages of balance sheet normalization.  The decision to retain our current operating procedure means that, after allowing for currency in circulation, the ultimate size of our balance sheet will be driven principally by financial institutions’ demand for reserves, plus a buffer so that fluctuations in reserve demand do not require us to make frequent sizable market interventions.  Estimates of the level of reserve demand are quite uncertain, but we know that this demand in the post-crisis environment is far larger than before.  Higher reserve holdings are an important part of the stronger liquidity position that financial institutions must now hold.  Moreover, based on surveys and market intelligence, current estimates of reserve demand are considerably higher than estimates of a year or so ago.  The implication is that the normalization of the size of the portfolio will be completed sooner, and with a larger balance sheet, than in previous estimates. In light of these estimates and the substantial progress we have made in reducing reserves, the Committee is now evaluating the appropriate timing for the end of balance sheet runoff.  This decision will likely be part of a plan for gradually reaching our ultimate balance sheet goals while minimizing risks to achieving our dual-mandate objectives and avoiding unnecessary market disruption.  We will be finalizing these plans at coming meetings. The process of balance sheet normalization is unprecedented.  Throughout this process we’ve attempted to lay out our plans well in advance, and we’ve been willing to make changes as we learn more about the process.  The implementation and normalization statement released today is intended to provide some additional clarity regarding the conditions under which we January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL might adjust our plans.  The statement makes three points:  First, as we’ve long emphasized, the federal funds rate is our active monetary policy tool. Second, as far as the particular details of normalization are concerned, we will not hesitate to make changes in light of economic and financial developments.  This does not mean that we would use the balance sheet as an active tool, but occasional changes could be warranted. Third, we repeat a sentence of the normalization principles we adopted in June of 2017.  While the federal funds rate would remain our active tool of policy in a wide range of scenarios, we recognize that the economy could again present conditions in which federal funds rate policy is not sufficient.  In those cases, the FOMC would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including balance sheet policy. Times of economic uncertainty put a premium on the clarity and predictability of FOMC policy.  We are committed to clearly explaining what we are doing and why we’re doing it, both regarding the path of rates and also regarding management of the balance sheet.  We believe that this transparency is how we can best contribute to macroeconomic stability. Thank you. I’ll be glad to take your questions. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  So you’ve said many times recently that policy was still accommodative and that it needn’t be so.  You’ve said recently that policy—the state of the policy was still accommodative and that the economy didn’t require that anymore.  Is that still the case?  If so, how do you justify the removal of the need for some further interest rate increases?  Basically, are we at neutral now, or does the economy still need accommodation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  We think that our policy is at the appropriate point right now.  We think our policy stance is appropriate right now.  We do.  We also know that our policy rate January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL is now in the range of the Committee’s estimates of neutral.  So we’ll be—again, we think our policy stance is appropriate. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long from the Washington Post.  Last week, the IMF said risks are clearly skewed to the downside for the U.S. and global economy.  Can you clarify—does the FOMC see risks as skewed to the downside, particularly after you removed the statement about risks being balanced? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  We had an extensive discussion of the baseline and also of the risks to the baseline, and the risks are, of course, the fact that financial conditions have tightened, that global growth has slowed, as well as some, let’s say, government-related risks like Brexit and trade discussions, and also the effects and ultimate disposition of the shutdown.  So we looked at—we look at those, and the way we think of it is that policy—we will use our policy, and we have, to offset risks to the baseline.  So we view the baseline as still solid, and part of that is the way we adjusted our baseline to address those risks.  So that’s the way we’re thinking about that now. 

[SECTION]

SAM FLEMING.  Thanks.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.  The Fed has linked its commitment to patience in part to subdued inflation outcomes.  Would you be comfortable with continuing patience even if there are modest, if transient, overshoots to the inflation target by core inflation?  How sensitive are you right now to developments in core inflation when determining the next move?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, generally speaking, we think the outlook is favorable, and we think that these crosscurrents that I referred to—these risks—are going to be with us for a while.  We think our stance is appropriate.  We think there’s no pressing need to change our policy stance and no need to rush to judgment there. January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL I would say that we’ll be looking at a full range of data, and that will include inflation data.  It will include all data relevant to our dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.  Remember that our inflation objective is a symmetric one, meaning that we are—we’re always trying to get to 2 percent, and we don’t look at—we look at inflation equally on both sides.  So I can’t get into specific hypotheticals, but I do believe that we have a symmetric objective, and I believe we’ll act that way. 

[SECTION]

RICHARD MILLER.  We learned from the last minutes of the meeting that some of the tweaks you make to the statement have a lot more portent than we thought.  In light of that, I’m wondering if you can provide us with a “decoder ring” for this statement.  “Adjustments”—does that suggest the next move in interest rates is as likely to be up as down?  And when you twin “in light of global economic and financial developments” with “muted inflation pressures,” does that suggest you have to see both the cessation of these crosscurrents that you’ve talked about and inflation moving up before you get off the dime, so to speak, and move? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sorry—say again what the first question was? 

[SECTION]

RICHARD MILLER.  First question is, “adjustments”—is that meant to imply the next move is as most likely to be up as down? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Yes.  I’m just going to say that the—it’s going to depend entirely on the data.  We’re not making a judgment.  We don’t have a strong prior.  We will be—we will patiently wait and let the data clarify.  Some of the crosscurrents that I refer to may be with us for a while, and I think we’ll be looking at seeing those clear up as it relates to—as they relate to the outlook for the U.S. and that will be an important aspect as well.  Your second question was? January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

RICHARD MILLER.  Would it be not just the cessation of those crosscurrents, but the end of these muted inflation pressures—are they both sort of things that are necessary for you to change this “patient” stance? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, it’s really hard to speak about generalities.  We’ll be looking at everything, but I do think that, you know, muted inflation pressures—you know, you would want—I would want to see a need for further rate increases, and, for me, a big part of that would be inflation.  It wouldn’t be the only thing, but it would certainly be important. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, did the Committee discuss an actual change to the runoff policy or the runoff schedule right now?  If so, is that under consideration right now, and when might we know?  The second thing is, I have to nail down this thing.  You guys, Fed folks, keep mentioning the “market average” or the “market outlook” for the size of the balance sheet.  Are you endorsing the market average, which is 3½ trillion?  And if you’re not endorsing it, why do you keep mentioning it? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Okay.  So today I’m here to talk about decisions and also discussions about decisions that haven’t been made.  So we’re talking about the latter thing, which is discussions, and so I can’t get ahead of where decisions are.  But so the Committee is—what we’re looking to do is create a whole plan that will bring us to our goal, our longer-run goal, which is a balance sheet no larger than it needs to be for us to efficiently conduct—efficiently and effectively conduct monetary policy, but to do so in a way that doesn’t put our goals at risk or result in unnecessary market turmoil.  So there are a lot of pieces to that, and we’ve learned over time that it’s—when making these—when designing these plans, like, for example, the original normalization plan, it’s good to take your time.  Let the best ideas rise to the top.  Let them stand the test of time and argument and then move when you’re really January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL comfortable with what you’ve got and when you feel you can communicate it clearly.  So I don’t want to get ahead of that process today. But—so we’ve discussed—there are a number of pieces to that puzzle.  There are several different pieces to them, and I think they’re coming—and I’m very pleased with the progress that we’ve made, and, you know, the piece that you mentioned is something that is in those discussions.  That’s the first question.  I’m not going to give our estimate or ratify anybody else’s estimate of what the equilibrium balance sheet is here today.  There are estimates out there, but I’m not at a point today where I’m going to be giving out numbers on that.  But there are estimates, and I think they’re consistent with what I said, broadly speaking. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  So, just to clarify—I’m sorry, you did discuss reducing the pace of the runoff?  That sounds like what you said, to me. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Yes, it’s—so, again, we haven’t made any decisions.  There no one of many pieces that is in the discussion.  And that was reflected in the last minutes, actually. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chairman Powell, I want to follow up on Steve’s question.  The size of the balance sheet obviously matters a great deal, but, so, too, if you follow the arguments that were made when the Fed was purchasing these assets, does the duration of those holdings.  So once you are—once you reach the terminal level of reserves and you have to reinvest maturing mortgage-backed securities into Treasuries, it will matter a great deal, of course, where along the curve the Fed resumes those reinvestments. And so I wonder, what does your staff research show about the degree of accommodation that would be provided by either moving to the front end of the curve and holding or investing, January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL perhaps, in shorter maturity assets, versus the other approach that was identified in the December meeting minutes, which would be to simply reflect issuance of the outstanding Treasury maturities?  And which approach do you think is more appropriate in the current environment? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  These are great questions.  Let me say that the question of the ultimate composition of our balance sheet in the longer run is a very important one, and it’s one that we see ourselves as coming to, you know, fairly soon, as in, in coming meetings.  It won’t be the first thing we work on, but it will be one of the first things that we try to resolve.  We had discussions at one of the last two meetings on this, and we haven’t come to a judgment on that.  And, you know, I wouldn’t comment beyond saying that we understand that’s a key question, and there are, you know, there are issues to be decided.  There are benefits and costs to doing—to taking different approaches, and I wouldn’t want to prejudge them today. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, New York Times.  I am struggling a little bit to understand what has changed since we sat here with you six weeks ago.  You’ve said today that you think that inflation would be the reason that the Fed would need to continue raising rates.  Has the inflation outlook shifted that dramatically in the last six weeks?  Can you speak specifically to why you’ve moved from a posture of saying we expect to keep raising rates this year to a posture of standing still? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I’d point to a couple of things.  First, the narrative of slowing global growth continues, if you will.  The incoming data have shown more of that.  We’ve seen that both in China and in Western Europe, and so that’s an important—that has important implications for us, and that story has—let’s just say it continues. And, in addition—I mean, I think important—possibly less important now—probably less important now, but—has been the shutdown, which will leave some sort of imprint on first-January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL quarter GDP.  We don’t know the ultimate resolution of it.  If that’s all there is, and the shutdown is gone and there isn’t another shutdown, then we’ll get most of that back in the second period—second quarter. So those things—in addition, you know, you have to look back.  Financial conditions began to tighten in the fourth quarter.  And they now have persisted and remain tighter—significantly tighter, let’s say—than they were, and that’s something that we have to take into account as well.  So that’s where we are. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  You said you like to be a plain speaker, so let me try to have you put this as plainly as possible.  Is it fair to characterize this as not a pause in a tightening cycle, but the end of the tightening cycle now—a new regime for the Fed?  And, if not, can you put a time frame on “patient”?  Does “patient” have some sort of time frame?  And I’m wondering about your reaction to the criticism you got on your December 19th news conference, your later statements—do you feel you’ve put a “Powell put” into the markets? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, patience—I think we’re going to know in hindsight, because the length of this patient period is going to depend entirely on incoming data and its implications for the outlook.  So that’s going to be—so it’s hard to say, you know, it’s hard to think of what to call it at this point or how to label it. So really, your second question is about how do we think about financial conditions.  And I would say this:  We think about a broad range of financial conditions, not just one or two things.  You know, it’s interest rates, it’s risk spreads, it’s currency, it’s the stock market, it’s credit availability, it’s many, many factors.  And what matters for financial conditions is, when there are changes and those changes are sustained for a period of time, then they become January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL important for us because they have important macroeconomic implications.  So that’s how we think about it. So we don’t react to, you know, to most things that happen in the financial markets.  But when we see a sustained change in financial conditions, then that’s something that has to play into our thinking.  In fact, our policy works through changing financial conditions, so it’s sort of the essence of what we do. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  I just wanted to ask, first of all, about whether the Fed is gathering information about some of the new money laundering information that’s come out about Deutsche Bank and Danske Bank and whether you have any concerns there?  And then, also, I was just wondering if you could say whether there’s any kind of timeline on when the Fed might make a decision on real-time payments and whether you’re going to build a real-time payment system? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Right.  So, on the first question, I can—we don’t comment on individual investigations or whether they’re happening.  I will say that we take our enforcement powers very seriously, and we put them to work when we feel it’s justified. In terms of real-time payments, it’s something we’re very actively working on.  As you obviously know, we have some proposals out, and we’re considering them.  You know, the thing is, it’s very important in that space to consult with the full range of market participants and interest groups, consumer groups, and we’ve done that, as I’m sure you know, over a period of years.  We don’t have plenary authority to just do things, for the most part, in the payment space.  We’ve been more of a convener, bringing industry and the public—public interest groups—and all those groups around the table.  And we’ve—I think we’ve played a constructive role in that respect, and I believe that will continue. January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Thanks.  Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Times.  You and your colleagues may have noticed, President Trump, for the past six months, has been urging the Fed not to raise rates—to stop raising rates.  How would you respond to those who would suggest that the Fed just caved to the president’s demands? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So what we care about—and, really, the only thing we care about at the Fed—is doing our job for the American people and using our tools appropriately.  So that’s very strongly our culture.  I think anyone who knows the Fed or who has worked at the Fed would recognize that description.  So we’re always going to do what we think is the right thing.  We’re never going to take political considerations into account or discuss them as part of our work.  You know, we’re human.  We make mistakes.  But we’re not going to make mistakes of character or integrity.  And I would want the public to know that, and I would want them to see that in our actions. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business News.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The long-term federal funds rate is 2.8 percent.  I’ve talked the last year with a number of Fed presidents who worry that under 3 percent is not enough to handle the next recession.  You say that’s your first tool, that’s your primary means of adjusting monetary policy.  So with a larger balance sheet—with a larger balance sheet, could you—how could you handle that next recession, then, with the combination of those two? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I guess the sense of your question is that we could be in a situation in the future—we hope not, but—we could be in a situation where we’d like to cut rates more than we can effectively, and we hit the zero lower bound.  We don’t think anything like that is in the cards.  Now, there’s no reason to think that it would be.  But as we said in today’s release, if that happens, then we’ll use the full range of our tools, and that includes the balance January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL sheet.  But we would use it after using our conventional tools, which would be the interest rate and forward guidance about the interest rate. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Even if you have a large balance sheet—$4 trillion?  Above $4 trillion? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Yes.  There would be room to do substantially more. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN.  I just wanted to go back to—you had mentioned on the crosscurrents, the government shutdown issue.  You mentioned a couple of weeks ago that that information would clearly show up in the data.  I’m wondering, as you guys discussed during this week’s meeting, what the potential economic impact would be of the shutdown, the possibility of a second one, whether or not it would diminish consumer confidence, have some severe ripple effects?  Just talking to other folks outside, businesses—clearly they were suffering and seeing a lot of pain.  I’m just wondering about, for American families that missed two paychecks, how is this going to play out for them for the months to come? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Right.  So let me give you the economic side of it first—is that, even with a fairly long shutdown, as long as that’s the end of it and everyone gets their backpay—except the contractors, I guess, the private-sector contractors, but—some people get their backpay, then the lost GDP will be regained in the second quarter.  So that’s that.  I would say that the—you know, we all see the suffering and the heartbreak and all the pain people go through.  I see, you know, federal employees doing their work, and I’m, you know, really grateful they did.  I mean, to be doing your work while you’re not getting paid, it’s something we should all be grateful for.  Did that answer both your questions? January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Yes, it does.  So you don’t see a permanent effect of this shutdown?  And I’m just wondering if you’re thinking about the path of future policy and the possibility of reaching this point again on February 15? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So would there be a permanent effect?  As I mentioned, there wouldn’t be if there isn’t another shutdown.  If there were going to be a permanent effect or a lasting effect, let’s say, it would be from a longer shutdown or perhaps a second shutdown, and that would be through the channel of a loss of confidence in our ability to make policy in the United States.  That would be the channel.  And I think that was something that we and many others were worried about as there was talk of an even longer shutdown.  In terms of ideas for not having more shutdowns, I know Congress is actually looking at some of those, so I think that could be a profitable thing to explore. this meeting noted a rising concern among business contacts about higher trade tariffs and the tensions there.  Did that play a part in the discussion and the decision that you made on shifting the wording in your statement? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, trade—you sound like you’re an avid reader of the Beige Book, and that’s great—the trade, as you will know, then—trade has been a big feature in the Beige Book for some time now.  The Beige Book is a collection of all of our—of the comments that our Reserve Bank presidents get from their Districts.  It’s incredibly valuable, because you’re getting actual reports from people who are on the line.  And there have been real concerns about trade right along the line, both in terms of availability of materials and costs and retaliation and that kind of thing.  So that’s been a concern. January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL I would say the longer-term concern, though, is the negotiations that are going on.  If they linger, then there could be more and more uncertainty, and you worry over time that that could have an effect on business confidence.  So far, the actual amount of tariffs that have been applied both here and in China is not enough to have material effects on GDP either here or in China.  So the concern is more a longer—for me—a longer, drawn-out set of negotiations back and forth, which could result in sapping business confidence.  Uncertainty is not the friend of business.

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  I’m Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace.  I want to talk to you about corporate debt.  Are you worried that by taking a pause in raising interest rates—we’ve had low interest rates for so long—are you contributing to a bubble in corporate debt? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, we did—we’ve called out corporate debt as a risk—more of a macroeconomic risk, I think, than a financial stability risk, the sense of that being that if you have companies that are highly levered and we do go into a downturn, they’re going to be less able to weather that and keep serving their customers and, you know, may have to do layoffs and things like that.  So they can amplify, in effect, a negative downturn.  So we watch that. We also watch carefully for the exposure of the financial system to these companies.  In other words, banks are arranging a lot of these loans.  The question is, what is their exposure?  Do they retain big pieces of the loans?  Do they have obligations to underwrite loans which build up in a pipeline?  So we monitor those risks very carefully.  And, frankly, the banks monitor them much better with our support and help than they did before the crisis.  So it’s a concern.  It’s something that we’re watching.  Of course, you know, November, December, and January were much slower months for those sorts of things.  But, you know, it’ll be something that we’re always paying close attention to. January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL

GREG ROBB.  Chairman Powell, Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Financial markets have reacted strongly to the decision and the press conference.  The Dow Jones industrial average is up more than, like, 500 points.  There’s a sense in the market that there’s, you know, what people call the “Powell put” on the markets.  Are financial markets wrong in that assessment? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, I would point to all the continuity here.  You know, the thing we did on the balance sheet is something we’ve been working on for, frankly, years—the thing we announced today.  And so we’re providing clarity there.  I think that’s a constructive thing to do. My—honestly—only motivation is to do the right thing for the economy and for the American people—that’s it.  And this situation, I think, calls for patience—I think it does.  And it’s just the stance of policy we think is appropriate.  We see these uncertainties, and we see a time when we can afford to—we have the luxury of being able to wait and watch, and that’s what we’re planning to do.  And I think it’s the right thing.  I feel strongly that it is. 

[SECTION]

JOHN HELTMAN.  Chairman Powell, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency last year completed its fintech charter.  And one of the questions around that charter has been whether the Federal Reserve will allow such a chartered bank to access the payment system.  I’m curious if you think a fintech charter is a good idea in general, and what conditions you think might be necessary to allow the Fed to allow such a chartered institution access to the payment system. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I’m not going to be able to help you much on that.  Those are great questions, and those are questions that are, you know, that our great supervisory people are looking at.  I think we’re open to these ideas, but I don’t have any news for you on that today. January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

STEVE BECKNER.  Thank you.  Steve Beckner, freelance journalist reporting for NPR.  Mr. Chairman, you’ve echoed the widespread concern about slowing growth in China and elsewhere in the world, but I wonder whether it’s possible that slower growth abroad might actually be beneficial to this country, in some respects, at least—for example, perhaps increasing capital inflows and putting downward pressure on long-term rates in this country, as happened in the Asian financial crisis in the late ’90s. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, Steve, it’s certainly possible.  Ultimately, though, you know, a strong global economy is good for us.  We export to these countries.  We trade with these countries.  I mean, part of the story of 2017, for example, was that European growth kept coming in stronger and stronger, and that meant the euro was strong, and that supported our exports.  So, ultimately, I think we benefit from having strong growth abroad, although you point to an interesting case. you probably heard, the Congressional Budget Office is projecting that federal debt is expected to surge to about $29 trillion over the next 10 years, reaching the highest share since the end of World War II.  First of all, does that sound like it could be a reasonable forecast, with the Administration seeming to take plenty of opportunities to question the legitimacy of CBO?  And then, secondly, what effect does that have on interest rates and the public if indeed that’s even close to being true? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, first, it is important—we don’t do fiscal policy.  We don’t advise the government or Congress on fiscal policy, so I’ll limit myself to more high-level comments and say that it is not a secret—it is a long-known fact that the U.S. federal government budget is on an unsustainable path, and that needs to be addressed.  And that is driven principally January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL by the combination of health-care costs—really, due to our health-care delivery system—and the aging of the population.  And there’s no time like now—when the economy is healthy, growing, people are working—to go after that problem.  Ultimately, we will have to.  We don’t have a forecast.  We don’t forecast those things.  I have no reason to doubt CBO’s numbers on this.  I haven’t actually looked at that report, but my general experience with them is that it’s a professional outfit. the road? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, you know, first of all, our—the work that we do relates more to the medium term rather than the long term.  And so I don’t see this, in particular, as a threat to this business cycle or to the economy this year.  It’s more in the longer run, we’ll be spending all of our money on paying interest and not on the things that we really need to be doing for future generations and for our own generation.  So it’s a serious problem, but it’s not a problem that is something that either helps or prevents the Fed from doing our job today. 

[SECTION]

PAUL KIERNAN.  Hi, Chairman.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.  I know where the FOMC participants’ estimates for the long-run interest rate are.  They’re all above 2½ percent.  Right now we’re between 2.25 and 2½.  So I think a key question right now is, is policy accommodative at this moment?  Are we looking at staying accommodative for some time, or has your estimate of neutral come down, in light of the recent volatility in markets?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So the range of estimates on the Committee starts at 2½ percent, and that’s kind of roughly where we currently are.  And as I’ve said a couple of times, when you get to that range—you know that we can’t directly observe the neutral rate.  We January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL only know it by its works.  And so we have to put aside our own priors of what that rate might be and let the data speak to us.  So we can do that.  We’re in the range.  There are a number of Committee members who are, you know, right around that range.  And I think we’re watching to see. We don’t—I don’t—again, I think that our policy stance today is appropriate for the state of the economy.  That’s my feeling.  We’re going to be watching data to see whether that’s right, and we’re also going to be watching data to see how these crosscurrents resolve themselves and how the U.S. economy performs this year. 

[SECTION]

VIRGINIE MONTET.  Thank you.  Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse.  Among the global developments that the Fed is monitoring, how much of a risk for the American expansion would be the prospect of a “hard” Brexit? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So we’ve been monitoring the Brexit situation very carefully for a long time.  And for us, that starts with U.S. financial institutions that have a presence either in the U.K. or in the EU or both.  So we have worked with those institutions alongside U.K. and EU regulators to assure ourselves that those firms have plans and have liquidity and have all of the things they will need to deal with the full range of Brexit outcomes.  So we’ve done a lot of work on that, and, generally speaking—again, a lot of work has been done—we have to be humble and say that this is an unprecedented event.  But that’s the financial system aspect of it. If there is a hard Brexit, then that would very likely involve disruptions both to the continental economy and certainly to the U.K. economy, and we would feel that.  The question for us—it wouldn’t be a huge first-order thing, the economic effects, unless you saw financial disruptions.  So, if you saw financial turmoil and that kind of thing, that would be the way it would reach us. January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL I would expect that we would feel some of this, and it’s very hard to have great confidence that you know what that would be.  But it would be something—probably not material to our economy, but it’s something we’ll be watching very carefully and certainly hoping that there is a resolution short of a hard Brexit. 

[SECTION]

JEAN YUNG.  Hi, I’m Jean Yung with Market News.  I have a question about the ultimate size of the balance sheet.  How will the Fed judge what is a reasonable level for financial institutions’ demand for reserves when it appears to be rising at a fast pace over the past year and perhaps at a faster pace than can be explained by regulatory changes during that same time frame?  Would you prefer to err on the side of being more generous, or would you try to encourage banks from holding—to hold less reserves? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Let me be clear.  I don’t know that demand for reserves has risen over the past years.  I think our understanding of demand for reserves—remember that the banks have more reserves than they need.  Reserves are still quite abundant. So the question is, how much of that amount is actually going to be needed in the end after, you know, after the firms adjust to our very gradual decrease?  And so our understanding, really, of the distribution of reserves and how much will be needed has moved up over the past year.  And then there would be a buffer on top of that.  And then we would want to be—we would want to have a buffer, as I mentioned in my remarks, because we want to be operating in an abundant reserves regime where we operate through our administered rates. If you operate too close to that point of scarcity, then you wind up having to have these big, ongoing interventions in the market.  We don’t want the Fed to have a, you know, a large ongoing presence in the market around this.  We’d rather just, you know—in managing the January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL federal funds rate, we’d rather have it set by our administered rates.  So that implies you’d want to be a bit above what that equilibrium demand for reserves is. And, again, there’s no cookbook here, there’s no playbook.  No one really knows.  The only way you can figure it out is by surveying people and market intelligence and then, ultimately, by approaching that point quite carefully. 

[SECTION]

JEAN YUNG.  But do you take the survey results as given, or do you try to encourage banks from holding a [inaudible]? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  We don’t take—you know, we don’t think we have a precise understanding of this at all.  I want to be clear about that.  These estimates are fairly uncertain.  So if you think that the level of demand for reserves is here [gesturing with hands together, in the middle], all you can say is, it’s probably somewhere in this range [gesturing with hands apart, equidistant from the middle]. If banks want to use reserves for a good and sufficient reason—which is to say, to hold liquidity as we require them to do to meet the liquidity coverage ratio, to meet their resolution requirements and resolution planning—we’re not going to discourage them from holding them.  They are, in fact, a very safe asset—in a way, the safest asset.  And we want the banks to be safe and sound. this purpose. We didn’t create the reserves, you know, with that in mind, but, you know, since—in the post-crisis, you know, regulatory regime, we have brand-new and quite substantial liquidity requirements, which are very good and which have great public benefit.  So it’s not a bad thing that banks hold onto these reserves or another safe asset.  We don’t—we’re not encouraging them to hold reserves instead of Treasuries.  Treasuries or reserves are roughly equivalent for January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

COURTENAY BROWN.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Courtenay Brown from Axios.  A data-dependency question:  Has there been a prioritization of market data over the economic data?  How do you balance those two things? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I would say that, you know, our mandate is maximum employment and stable prices, and that’s about, you know, hard, real-side economic data.  We—as I mentioned earlier, we—our tool, you know, our interest rate tool operates on the economy through financial conditions.  So financial conditions matter, and they matter in the way that I suggested earlier—which is to say, broad financial conditions changing over a sustained period—that has implications for the macroeconomy.  It does.  So if you lower interest rates and they stay low, every borrower in the country ultimately has a lower interest rate.  That’ll have an effect on—over time, an effect on the economy.  But, again, the entire focus we have is on maximum employment and stable prices, not on any particular financial market or financial conditions generally. 

[SECTION]

MYLES UDLAND.  Chairman Powell, Myles Udland with Yahoo Finance.  I would just ask, I guess, about the balance sheet in general.  And are you surprised at how much of a conversation we’re having around the balance sheet, and how much talk about the balance sheet from yourself and various Fed officials have moved financial markets?  Because putting out a statement, clarifying your view on the balance sheet, you know, is somewhat surprising, considering it is restating, you know, what the Fed had said all along was the goal with balance sheet normalization—to roll it off, not have it be a key part of policy.  And so I would just ask, are you surprised by how far that conversation has gotten just in the last six weeks? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, I’ll quickly go back—in 2017, we were—in designing the normalization plan, we were concerned at not having two active tools of policy.  January 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL We learned during the taper tantrum, frankly, in 2013 that was—that would be confusing to very transparent so that you could look and know really, certainly as to Treasuries, pretty much the exact amounts and the timing in which we would be returning these assets to private hands.  And we put that out there very publicly and in the hope that it would be priced in and understood, and that then we could put the balance sheet on the side and have interest rates be the active tool of policy. So that went along that way very well, and I think that division of labor was a good one for our policy and for the benefit of the country.  I think that there’s—I think the market is now looking for more clarity around that, and I think we’ll be providing it.  That’s what’s happened.  Thanks very much. ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
25,2019-03-20,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome.  I will begin with an overview of economic conditions and an explanation of the decisions the Committee made at today’s meeting. My colleagues and I have one overarching goal:  to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people.  The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there.  The jobs market is strong, showing healthier wage gains and prompting many people to join or remain in the workforce.  The unemployment rate is near historic lows, and inflation remains near our 2 percent goal.  We continue to expect that the American economy will grow at a solid pace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong pace of 2018.  We believe that our current policy stance is appropriate. Since last year, however, we have noted some developments at home and around the world that bear close attention.  Given the overall favorable conditions in our economy, my colleagues and I will be patient in assessing what, if any, changes in the stance of policy may be needed.  Let me explain in more detail how incoming data warrant our current stance and a wait-and-see approach to changes. With the benefit of fiscal stimulus and other tailwinds, growth in 2018 was strong—in fact, at 3.1 percent, the strongest year in more than a decade.  For some time, most forecasts have called for growth to continue in 2019 at a somewhat lower but still healthy pace.  For example, last September, Committee participants saw growth coming in at about 2.5 percent this year.   Data arriving since September suggest that growth is slowing somewhat more than expected.  Financial conditions tightened considerably over the fourth quarter.  While conditions  March 20, 2019  have eased since then, they remain less supportive of growth than during most of 2018.  Growth      Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  has slowed in some foreign economies—notably, in Europe and China.  While the U.S. economy showed little evidence of slowdown through the end of 2018, the limited data we have so far this year have been somewhat more mixed.  Unusually strong payroll job growth in January was followed by little growth at all in February.  Smoothing through these variations, average monthly job growth appears to have stepped down from last year’s strong pace, but job gains remain well above the pace necessary to provide jobs for new labor force entrants.  Many other labor market indicators continue to show strength.  Weak retail sales data for December bounced back considerably in January but, on balance, seem to point to somewhat slower growth in consumer spending.  Business fixed investment also appears to be growing at a slower pace than last year.  Inflation has been muted, and some indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remain at the low end of their ranges in recent years.  Along with these developments, unresolved policy issues, such as Brexit and the ongoing trade negotiations, pose some risks to the outlook. Much of the discussion at our meeting focused on what we should make of the varied indicators.  Today’s Summary of Economic Projections, the SEP, reflects the assessments of individual Committee participants.  And these views are in line with a broad range of other forecasts and point to a modest slowdown, with overall conditions remaining favorable.  FOMC participants sought—now see 2019 growth at roughly 2 percent, with the unemployment rate remaining below 4 percent.  Core inflation, which omits the effects of volatile food and energy prices, remains close to 2 percent.  Declines in oil prices since last fall are expected to push headline inflation below 2 percent for a time, but this effect is likely to be temporary.  Now, I’m  March 20, 2019  describing views of the most likely outcomes, but historical experience reminds us that growth      Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL and inflation this year could be stronger or weaker than what we now project. The federal funds rate is now in the broad range of estimates of neutral—the rate that tends neither to stimulate nor to restrain the economy.  As I noted, my colleagues and I think that this setting is well suited to the current outlook and believe that we should be patient in assessing the need for any change in the stance of policy.  “Patient” means that we see no need to rush to judgment.  It may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a change in policy. In discussing the Committee’s projections, it’s useful to note what those projections are, as well as what they are not.  The SEP includes participants’ individual projections of the most likely economic scenario, along with their views of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate in that scenario.  Views about the most likely scenario form one input into our policy discussions.  We also discuss other plausible scenarios, including the risk of more worrisome outcomes.  These and other scenarios and many other considerations go into policy but are not reflected in projections of the most likely case.  Thus, we always emphasize that the interest rate projections in the SEP are not a Committee decision.  They are not a Committee plan.  As Chair Yellen noted some years ago, the FOMC statement, rather than the dot plot, is the device that the Committee uses to express its opinions about the likely path of rates. Today the Committee released Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans—revised Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans.  We have long said that the size of the balance sheet will be considered normalized when the balance sheet is once again at the smallest level consistent with conducting monetary policy efficiently and effectively.  We have sought to make the normalization process transparent, predictable, and gradual in order to minimize  March 20, 2019  disruption and risks to our dual-mandate objectives.  Today’s announcement is the result of      Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL discussions over the past four FOMC meetings about how best to achieve these goals.  The plans have many technical details, and I’ll be happy to answer questions on those details.  But, for now, I’ll summarize the key elements. Since October 2017, we have been allowing our asset holdings to decline by not reinvesting all of the payments we receive as securities matured or were prepaid.  Today we announced that we intend to slow the runoff of our assets starting in May and to cease runoff entirely in September of this year. In September, reserve balances may still be somewhat above the level required to conduct policy efficiently and effectively.  If this is so, we may hold the size of our asset holdings roughly constant for a time.  During this time, ongoing gradual increases in currency and our other nonreserve liabilities would imply very gradual declines in reserve balances.  When the Committee judges that reserves should not decline further, securities holdings will again begin to rise, as dictated by the growth of demand for our reserve and nonreserve liabilities.  We believe that these plans will facilitate a predictable, transparent, and smooth process, and we will make additional adjustments if conditions warrant. The Committee will soon turn to a few remaining normalization topics, including the desired maturity composition of our portfolio of Treasury securities.  We maintain our long-stated intention to return to a portfolio consisting mainly of Treasury securities. Thank you.  And I will be glad to take your questions. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long from the Washington Post.  On the broader economy, can you clarify how worried the FOMC is about a steep slowdown?  Some of the actions today  March 20, 2019  look like there is more worry.  And on the balance sheet, can you clarify:  Does the FOMC see      Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL the runoff as a form of monetary tightening? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, on the outlook, our outlook is a positive one.  So, as I mentioned, FOMC participants continue to see growth this year of around 2 percent, just a bit below what we saw back in—at the end of last year.  And part of that is seeing that economic fundamentals—underlying economic fundamentals are still very strong.  You have a strong labor have confidence surveys for households and also for businesses that are at attractive levels, and you also have financial conditions that are more accommodative than they were a couple of months ago.  So we see the outlook as a positive one. As far as balance sheet—the balance sheet plan, the answer to that is, you asked whether that’s related to our monetary policy, in effect, and the answer is really “no.”  We are—we still—we think of the interest rate tool as the principal tool of monetary policy, and we think of ourselves as returning the balance sheet to a normal level over the course of the next six months.  And we’re not really thinking of those as two different tools of monetary policy. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, can you talk about how global developments are affecting the U.S.?  What’s the cause of the weakness over there?  How much is it responsible for the downgrade in GDP over here?  And what impact are tariffs, both in the United States and retaliatory tariffs, having on both the U.S. and the global economies?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So the global economy was a tailwind for the United States in 2017.  That was the year of synchronized global growth.  And we began 2018 expecting and hoping for more of the same.  What happened instead is that the global economy started to gradually slow,  March 20, 2019  and now we see a situation where the European economy has slowed substantially—and so has      Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL the Chinese economy, although the European economy more.  And just as strong global growth was a tailwind, weaker global growth can be a headwind to our economy.  How big is that effect?  It’s hard to be precise about it, but, clearly, we will feel that.  It is an integrated global economy, and global financial markets are integrated as well. In terms of what’s causing it, it seems to be a range of different things.  In China, you have, you know, factors that are very specific to China.  The main point, though, is that, I would say, the outlook—let’s look at the outlook.  Chinese authorities have taken many steps since the middle of last year to support economic activity, and I think the base case is that, ultimately, Chinese activity will stabilize at an attractive level.  And in Europe, you know, we see some weakening, but, again, we don’t see—we don’t see recession, and we do see positive growth still. You ask about tariffs.  I would say, tariffs may be a factor in China.  I don’t think they’re the main factor.  I think the main factors are the delevering campaign that the government undertook a couple of years ago and also just the longer-term slowing to a more sustainable pace of growth that economies find as they mature.  In terms of our own economy, the level of tariffs is relatively small in the size of our economy—relative to the size of our economy.  We have, since the beginning of the year—and before, really—been hearing from our extensive network of business contacts a lot of concerns about tariffs, concerns about material costs on imported products, and the loss of markets and things like that, depending on which industry, so there’s a fair amount of uncertainty.  It’s hard to say how much of an effect that’s having on our economy.  It’s very hard to tease that apart.  But I will say, it’s been a prominent concern among our business contacts for some time now.  March 20, 2019       Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

JAMES PUZZANGHERA.  Hi.  Thank you, Chairman.  I want to switch gears temporarily to Wells Fargo.  Wells Fargo last week announced that its chief executive received a 5 percent pay raise last year, and this comes among continued settlements by the bank of various consumer abuse and reports that new consumer-unfriendly sales incentives are returning.  Do you have concerns about Wells Fargo’s efforts to fix its problems, and do you expect the asset cap to remain in place beyond this year? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Wells Fargo.  So what happened at Wells Fargo really was a remarkably widespread series of breakdowns, really, in their risk-management apparatus, which resulted in significant consumer abuses, let’s say.  And as it’s gone on and on, it’s become clear that—I think some time ago it became clear that these are deep problems that needed to be addressed in a fundamental kind of a way.  So there’s a lot of work to do on that.  And we put in place, really, an unprecedented sanction in the form of an asset growth cap, and we will not lift that until Wells Fargo gets their arms around this, comes forward with plans, implements those plans, and we’re satisfied with what they’ve done.  And that’s not where we are right now. 

[SECTION]

JAMES PUZZANGHERA.  Do you believe it’s appropriate—do you believe it’s appropriate for the CEO to be getting a pay raise in light of those conditions, in terms of corporate governance? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, our main supervisory focus is on the company fixing its risk-management approach and fundamentally rebuilding that approach.  We don’t approve individual pay packages.  We do supervise boards of directors for, you know, for having a set of compensation practices that don’t reward short-term risk-taking and that sort of thing.  And we will supervise based on that.  March 20, 2019       Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.  I wonder if you could discuss the balance of risks.  I know you said that the outlook among the Committee members is a positive one, but since the end of the meeting, the 3-month–10-year Treasury spread has fallen to 7 basis points, and now, according to fed funds futures trading, there’s a 50 percent chance of a rate cut by next January.  How far off are the markets?  What do you think the risks actually are? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, first, the data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another, in my view.  I would say it this way:  We see a positive outlook for this year, a favorable outlook for this year, as I mentioned.  So, in our SEP projections, Committee members, participants, generally see growth of around 2 percent.  They see unemployment remaining below 4 percent.  They see inflation remaining close to target.  And they see growth, as I said, around 2 percent.  So, you know, that’s a positive outlook.  It’s a favorable outlook.  We’re also very mindful—and we have been, of course, all along—of what the risks are.  And you see—you mentioned some of them.  You know, you see slowing global growth.  You still have—there’s no resolution of Brexit.  There’s no resolution, really, of the trade talks.  These are ongoing risks.  We’re also carefully monitoring what’s happening with U.S. growth.  We called that out in our statement.  You know, the limited data that we have do show a slowdown.  On the other hand, as I mentioned, we see the underlying economic fundamentals for growth this year as still very positive.  So that’s really how we’re thinking 

[SECTION]

JIM TANKERSLEY.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Jim Tankersley, New York Times.  I’m curious, you’re now a full percentage point—actually, more than a percentage point—below the White House in your projections for growth this year.  By my calculations, that’s the largest spread about it.  March 20, 2019  we’ve seen since the end of the recession between the White House and the Fed.  Why, for one,      Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  do you see—do you think you see the economy so differently than they do, and do you worry at all about implications for policy from that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I haven’t—I haven’t seen their projection.  I wouldn’t comment on their projection.  I would take it this way.  You can think of growth as being composed of two things.  And one is really growth in the workforce—more hours worked.  And the other is productivity—it’s output per hour.  You can really think of growth as those two things.  And I’ve been calling—often mentioning these days that it would be great if we had national-level policies to support higher labor force participation.  The United States is now one of the lowest countries among the advanced economies, in terms of our labor force participation by prime-age workers.  And that’s a place where we can grow faster.  If we can bring more people into the labor force and give them a chance to contribute to and benefit from our overall prosperity, that will be a great thing for the country.  So I would like to see that. Productivity is much harder.  It’s very difficult to project productivity over long stretches of time.  It’s a function of evolving technology.  So, I guess I would say, what is the potential growth rate?  It’s quite hard to know with any precision, and I just would like to see us, you know, undertake an effort to make it be as high as it can sustainably be. 

[SECTION]

JIM TANKERSLEY.  A quick follow-up on that.  Do you see the tax cuts—the 2017 tax cuts as having provided a large boost to labor force participation as the White House does? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I would say so.  I think it’s clear that the tax and spending policies that were adopted early last year supported demand in a significant way last year.  And it’s also the case, I think, that they should have some supply-side effects.  I think it’s hard to know, it’s hard to identify those with any precision, and we hope they’re—we hope they’re very large.  You  March 20, 2019  know, the idea would be that lowering corporate taxes would spur more corporate investment,      Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL which would spur more productivity, and lowering individual taxes would spur greater labor force participation.  I wouldn’t want to be handing—you know, assigning credit or blame for that, but I do think that the performance of labor force participation over the last, really, three or four years has been an upside surprise that most people didn’t see coming, and it’s extremely welcome. this meeting? dot plot today, you’ve gone from two rate hikes in 2019 to zero.  You still have one showing for next year.  The fed funds futures trading, as has been alluded to, is showing rate cuts at the end of this year.  Are they—is that a possibility in your mind, given the sharp change you’ve made at 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  As I mentioned, the data that we’re seeing are not currently sending a signal which suggests moving in either direction for me, which is really why we’re being patient.  We feel our policy rate is in the range of neutral.  The economy is growing at about trend.  Inflation is close to target.  Unemployment is under 3 percent.1  It’s a great time for us to be patient and watch and wait and see how things evolve. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  On stress testing, I wanted to ask, how do you respond to criticism that the Fed’s recent move to remove the qualitative objection from CCAR makes it less transparent to the general public?  And then, also, Governor Brainard dissented on that decision, and she’s dissented on some other decisions as well regulatorily recently.  Does it concern you, given that the Fed has traditionally been a consensus-                                                 1 Chair Powell intended to say that the unemployment rate is under 4 percent.  March 20, 2019  based organization, if you keep having these decisions where, you know, a Board member is not      Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  onboard with them? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So you mentioned the qualitative aspect of CCAR.  And U.S.—the large U.S. financial institutions have made significant progress there and are now much better at the capital planning process.  And for, really, some time now, for a couple of years, we’ve talked about moving supervision of that process—moving to a supervisory approach to that rather than having a pass/fail in the stress tests.  We’ve been talking about that for quite a while.  And I think, given the level that the banks have moved to in capital planning, we did that.  It shouldn’t be a big surprise—something we’ve been talking about doing for a couple of years.  For banks that are newer to CCAR and haven’t made that kind of progress, then they’re still going to be part of—they’re still going to have a qualitative test until they can reach similar levels of achievement. committed to that. In terms of having disparate views, I—look, we try—we are very much a consensus-driven organization.  We try very hard to reach consensus on things.  In the end, it’s very healthy to have disparate views and to state them publicly and put them on the record.  It’s nothing but healthy from my standpoint.  We’ll always be trying to reach consensus, and, you know, I’m 

[SECTION]

TREVOR HUNNICUTT.  Trevor Hunnicutt from Reuters.  Just—you mentioned that you have, kind of, a positive outlook as it regards the economy but also see slower growth on the household side and the business side.  Given how big of a part of the U.S. economy that is, what gives you, kind of, confidence that both the slowdown we’re seeing is temporary? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So on the household side, what we saw was a very weak reading on retail sales in December and then a bounceback in the January reading.  And, you know, it was a  March 20, 2019  surprise, I would say, and inconsistent with a significant amount of other data.  We’re not      Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL dismissing it in any way, but I would go back to, what is it that supports consumer spending?  It’s 70 percent of the economy, as you point out.  It’s strong economic underlying fundamentals, so, rising wages, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, high levels of job creation, confidence.  The household confidence surveys have moved back up to where they were last summer.  So we look at those fundamentals, and we think that looks like a setting in which consumption will have support from underlying economic fundamentals.  And that’s really what we’re thinking there.  So, you know, we’re also patiently watching and waiting and not assuming.  We’re not taking no signal from the incoming data; that’s why we called it out in our statement.  So I think our eyes are open on this. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, in 1998 the Fed eased policy in a way that some say may have avoided a recession, others say may have helped fuel the NASDAQ tech stock bubble.  And financial conditions have eased considerably this year since the policy pivot that you made clear in January.  The S&P, for example, is just 3 percent below last summer’s peak.  And so, I wonder, does this episode from 20 years ago bear at all on your thinking today about the risks posed by rising asset values in an environment of a shallower policy path? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We’re in a very different world today and post-crisis, because we now very carefully monitor financial conditions and financial stability concerns on an ongoing basis, and we publish a report twice a year, and we have quarterly Board meetings and briefings where we look deeply into these things.  So this is something we have very much on our radar screen.  And I would say, overall, we don’t see financial stability vulnerabilities as high.  There are some aspects of the financial markets that we’re carefully monitoring, and those are in the  March 20, 2019  nature of things that might be amplifiers to a downturn—as opposed to a financial stability      Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL concern, which might lead to a financial crisis and that kind of thing, which we don’t see.  So we do monitor that. And I would also say, you know, that the whole question of monetary policy and financial stability is an unsettled and difficult one in our world.  We do think that the principal tools for, you know, for managing financial stability are regulation, supervision, macroprudential tools, and those sorts of things as opposed to changing the interest rate.  But we’re certainly very mindful of financial conditions and those risks. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  If I could ask a follow-up—if it’s the case that we’re in a lower neutral interest rate world where you could have more asset price appreciation, do you think the Fed needs more macroprudential tools so that it doesn’t have to lean on monetary policy to do so much? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  It’s a very difficult question with a long answer.  We—in our system, we mainly rely on “through the cycle” tools like high capital and stress tests.  Our financial stability system is built on those tools:  high capital, high liquidity, resolution planning, stress testing.  So those are always on.  We also have some tools, like the countercyclical capital buffer, which we can deploy at times when vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal.  But we do rely on those tools.  And I would say, our banks are well capitalized.  They’re far better capitalized and better aware of their risks and more liquid than they were before the financial crisis.  So they’ll be more resilient in, you know, in difficult states of the economy.

DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak with CNN.  Included in the President’s fiscal 2020 budget is a new estimate that the nation’s debt will balloon to more than $31 trillion over the next decade, by 2029.  You’ve previously said that the country is on an unsustainable fiscal path.   March 20, 2019  How alarming is that number to you?  And, while the United States might not be quite there yet,      Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  when do you begin to worry about a possible credit crisis? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I do think that deficits matter, and I do think—I think it’s not really controversial to say that our debt can’t grow faster than our economy indefinitely and that’s what it’s doing now.  So this is something we will have to deal with, and I think we can’t really lose sight of that, and I’d like to see a greater focus on that over time.  It’s not in the nature of a near-term debt crisis or anything like that, and I wouldn’t want to try to predict when that would happen, but it is something that it’s important that the public discussion really come back to, if I can say that.  And we will have to deal with it eventually.

JAMES POLITI.  James Politi of the Financial Times.  There’s huge uncertainty at the moment over the fate of the Brexit negotiations.  How much of a factor has this been for the Fed in turning towards a kind of patient approach to monetary policy, and what’s your base case on that?  And on the size of the balance sheet, what’s your—do you have a numerical estimate for where it will be at the end of September once the runoff is complete? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, of course, we’re watching Brexit carefully and hoping that it can be resolved in an orderly way.  From our standpoint, the part of it that we can control is that we’ve been involved with supervising our financial institutions that are active either in the United Kingdom or the European Union or both to make sure that they’re ready for the full range of possible outcomes to the—to Brexit.  So—and in doing so, we’ve also had—we’ve also worked alongside regulators from the United Kingdom and the EU.  So we do, again, hope that that can be resolved well, but we know that our banks are well capitalized and resilient to different kinds of events.  March 20, 2019       Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL In terms of the size of the balance sheet, the balance sheet will be of a size of approximately 17 percent of GDP around the end of this year, down from 25 percent of GDP at the end of 2014—so, significantly smaller relative to GDP than it was.  I’m guessing you’re looking for a dollar number, though, probably, and that would be—so, for the size of the balance sheet, it looks like it’ll be a bit above $3.5 trillion then. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Chairman Powell, could you talk through your outlook for inflation this year?  Aren’t—you’re not concerned about it?  And rising—why aren’t rising wages feeding into inflation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Let me take wages first, if I can.  So wages have moved up in the last couple of years and are now running at healthier, higher levels, and that’s a good thing.  In fact, a lot of the wage gains have been going to lower-paid workers, as can happen late in the cycle, which is also a good thing.  So—but that’s not price inflation, that’s wage inflation.  Our mandate, sorry, is price inflation.  So what I see is inflation that’s close to 2 percent but that sort of keeps bumping up against 2 percent and then maybe moving back down a little bit. And I don’t feel that we have kind of convincingly achieved our 2 percent mandate in a symmetrical way.  Now, what do we mean by “symmetrical”?  What we really mean is that we would look at—we know that inflation will move around on both sides of the target, and what we say is that we would be equally concerned with inflation persistently above as persistently below the target. So that’s really our framework.  And I don’t think we’ve quite achieved that yet, because we’re really 10 years deep in this—almost 10 years—in this expansion, and inflation is still kind of, I’d say, not, you know, clearly meeting our target.  So that’s one of the reasons why we’re being patient.  I think, as I’ve said before, I think inflation that is a little bit below our target— March 20, 2019  particularly headline inflation this year will be, you know, meaningfully below our target for      Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL most of the year because of lower oil prices, but we project that core will be too—that gives us the ability to be patient and not move until we see that our target goals are being achieved. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  I just wanted to press a little bit about, what is the story the Committee—you know, when you get in the discussion today and yesterday about inflation, what kind of is the story that emerges? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So there are a bunch of different stories.  There’s no real easy answer.  One of them is just that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than people think.  That’s one way to think about it, that there’s still more slack in the economy.  Another is that expectations play a very—inflation expectations play a very key role in our framework and other frameworks, and, you know, there is the possibility that some people discuss of expectations being anchored but below 2 percent.  And so, either way, inflation itself has kind of bounced around a little below 2 percent.  That’s the record. 

[SECTION]

PAUL KIERNAN.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Thanks for the question.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.  I’m just kind of curious—I mean, this below-target inflation is a global phenomenon, at least across advanced economies, and I’d just like to kind of hear your thoughts about what kind of challenges that poses to policymakers like yourself and the global economy in general.  Yes, thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  It’s a major challenge.  It’s one of the major challenges of our time, really, to have inflation—you know, downward pressure on inflation, let’s say.  It gives central banks less room to, you know, to respond to downturns, right?  So if inflation expectations are below 2 percent, they’re always going to be pulling inflation down, and we’re going to be paddling upstream in trying to, you know, keep inflation at 2 percent, which gives us some room  March 20, 2019  to cut, you know, when it’s time to cut rates when the economy weakens.  And, you know, that’s      Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  something that central banks face all over the world, and we certainly face that problem too.  It’s one of the—one of the things we’re looking into as part of our strategic monetary policy review this year.  The proximity to the zero lower bound calls for more creative thinking about ways we can, you know, uphold the credibility of our inflation target, and, you know, we’re open minded about ways we can do that. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.  So I counted five downgrades in the first paragraph of the FOMC statement.  What conditions do you need to see in order for a rate cut or a rate hike on the other side of that then?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, we—I think we were—we wanted to be careful to go ahead and acknowledge the things.  I think it’s relatively little hard data so far this year, but we were careful to point out lower retail sales—the weak November meeting—BFI, all those things, and I think that was the right thing to do.2  Notwithstanding that, we do have a positive outlook for the year for the reasons I mentioned—you know, solid underlying economic fundamentals, et cetera.  So, and in terms of what it would take, I’d say, again, today we don’t see any—we don’t see data coming in that suggests that we should move in either direction.  They suggest that we should remain patient and let the situation clarify itself over time.  When the time comes, we’ll act appropriately. 

[SECTION]

MATTHEW BOESLER.  Hi.  Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg.  Fed Vice Chairman Rich Clarida has talked about how the decline in labor’s share of income and the corresponding high profit margins might mean that lower unemployment and higher wage growth is not flowing through to price inflation the way it used to.  But, so far throughout this tightening cycle, the Fed                                                  2 Chair Powell intended to point to the weak reading on retail sales for December 2018.  March 20, 2019  has not allowed wage growth to rise above longer-term interest rates until just very recently.  So      Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  I’m wondering if, going forward, given these insights about the labor share and high profit growth to continue accelerating without matching that with higher interest rates? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, let me say that we’ve had, you know, a significant move up in wages and compensation over the last few years, and I—which does not trouble me from the standpoint of inflation.  We’ve had—also had—in other cycles, we’ve had situations where, you know, unit labor costs were moving up above inflation, and that didn’t lead to price inflation.  It does—you know, in theory, it can squeeze corporate margins, and, you know, that can’t go on indefinitely.  But, nonetheless, I don’t see the current wage picture as concerning from an inflation standpoint. 

[SECTION]

MATTHEW BOESLER.  More generally, to the extent that wage growth in excess of interest rates allows households to pay down debt faster, whereas interest rates in excess of wage growth risks a further buildup in debt, how do you account for the sort of financial stability consequences of varying interest rates relative to wage growth? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I don’t think we look at—I understand what you’re asking, but we’re looking at—our mandate is price inflation and maximum employment, and that’s what we’re looking at with setting interest rates.  And we also monitor financial stability very carefully across all meaningful asset categories.  I don’t think we tie it particularly to the relationship you’re talking about. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Just a quick follow-up on Brexit.  You mentioned that you’re making sure that U.S. financial institutions are ready for whatever outcome.  I’m wondering, can you be a little more specific  March 20, 2019  about that?  And also, how are you preparing for any pressures that a hard Brexit would put on      Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL the U.S. dollar? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, as I mentioned, you know, with the stress tests that the largest financial institutions—and those are the ones that tend to be active internationally—that they undergo every year, we put them through very large financial shocks with large losses and big changes in markets every year.  And we vary that every year.  So that’s a pretty good—you know, having done that for a number of years now, that’s—and having them be required to have adequate capital and liquidity even after all that happens.  So that’s a good thing to have done, knowing that you’re going into something that’s quite unknown, which may prove stressful, it prepared our institutions well.  That said, nothing like this has happened in recent years, and so it’s really hard to be confident.  So we’re very watchful about what’s going on. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  And as far as the dollar goes? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we don’t—you know, we—the dollar is really the business of the Treasury Department.  It’s certainly a financial condition unto itself that plays into our models, but we don’t, you know, seek or model or attempt to affect the dollar directly with our policies. 

[SECTION]

JOHN HELTMAN.  Hi.  John Heltman—John Heltman with American Banker.  I have a question about the Fed’s proposal from October of last year regarding enhanced prudential standards for banks above $250 billion.  Some analysts have suggested that that proposal could encourage consolidation mergers and acquisition among banks, particularly at the upper end of the range.  I’m curious if the Fed anticipated that outcome and whether you have any reservations or whether you—the Fed cares about bank consolidation more generally.  March 20, 2019       Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We’re not motivated by a particular view of industry structure that we’re trying to achieve through our regulation.  I think we want to have banks of all different sizes and with different business models out there carrying out their functions in the economy.  So that’s how we think about that. I would also say, when banks merge and move into a larger asset category, they get stronger regulation, not weaker regulation.  So if you think about it, you know, if you’re a medium-sized bank and you merge with another medium-sized bank, you wind up being more than a medium-sized bank, you know. But the sense of our tapering is that—“tailoring,” sorry—our tailoring policy is that the highest expectations fall upon the largest, most systemically important, most complex institutions, and then at every step along the way, the expectations become more tailored to the risks that that institution actually presents to the economy.  So— 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  Thanks for taking my question.  So as the Fed remains on pause, does the central bank find the onus on fiscal policy to extend its economic recovery and fend off a slowdown—as in, is the Fed positioning itself to take on a reactionary role to whatever fiscal policy is doing?  I’m asking because we’re seeing the waning effect of tax reform and no material news on infrastructure, so just wondering kind of how you feel the monetary policy–fiscal policy balance is in swing right now. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we take—we take fiscal policy as, you know, as exogenous to what we do.  You know, in other words, whatever happens with fiscal policy, we take that.  We don’t evaluate it, we don’t criticize it, and we don’t overreact to it either.  So I think it’s just a fact.  It’s just an external fact about the economy for us.  I mean, our policy is—the reason we’re  March 20, 2019  on hold is that we think our policy rate is in a good place, and we think the economy is in a good      Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  place, and we’re watching carefully as we see these events evolve around the world and at home, and we think that’s what we need to be doing. 

[SECTION]

STEVEN BECKNER.  Steve Beckner, freelance journalist reporting for NPR, Mr. Chairman.  The Fed has been allowing the average maturity of securities in its bond portfolio to lengthen.  Is this aimed at—consciously aimed at flattening the yield curve, and is that going to be part of the Fed’s longer-run balance sheet strategy?  And if flattening the yield curve is a conscious long-term strategy, are you concerned about the side effect of the heightening concerns about a flatter or inverted yield curve being a harbinger of recession?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  The basic answer to your question is “no.”  We are—the decision about the maturity composition of the Fed’s balance sheet in the longer run lies ahead of us.  We have not made that decision, and we’re—we really haven’t begun to have a serious series of discussions over a series of meetings to grapple with that.  That, I think, will be something we turn to reasonably soon, but I think it will take some time.  It’s a consequential decision and one that needs some thought.  We’ve had a lot of balance sheet discussions, as I mentioned, over the last four meetings, but this is the next big one that—big decision that we’ll face.  And, you know, I think we’re not going to be in a rush to resolve it, but we’ll turn to it soon. 

[SECTION]

STEVEN BECKNER.  Can I just follow up, please?  Well, how do you account for the fact that the average maturity has in fact been lengthening and contributing to a flattening of the yield curve?  Is that—what’s—what’s causing that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I think, isn’t it just that as securities roll off, you wind up investing in—you know, as a 10-year rolls off, you wind up investing in a 10-year, and automatically that  March 20, 2019  lengthens things.  It’s not at all a plan to lengthen the balance sheet.  It’s just been—we try to      Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL have a practice that we don’t deviate from, and it’s transparent, and—no policy message in that. 

[SECTION]

JEAN YUNG.  Hi, Jean Yung with Market News.  I wanted to ask, at what point do you expect to begin to allow the balance sheet to grow slowly again?  What are—how will you make that decision? will shrink. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, as I—as I mentioned, the balance sheet runoff will stop at about—at September 30.  And if it is our view at that time that we’re still a ways away from—a ways above a balance sheet that is what we need to efficiently and effectively conduct monetary policy, at that time we will hold the balance sheet constant.  And then what’ll happen is, organically, very gradually, currency and other nonreserved liabilities will grow, and reserves And the question you’re asking is, how long will that go on?  The truth is, we don’t know, and we don’t really know that we’ll move past September 30th.  The level of reserve demand is something that we’ve put a lot of effort and time into creating estimates, based on evolve over time.  So we’ll just have to see.  I wouldn’t want to put a time out there for that, but—so I’ll just leave it there.

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I’m just going to say that I think we’re in a good place right now, which is, we’re being patient, we’re watching, we don’t see any data pushing us to  March 20, 2019  move rates in either direction, and we’re going to watch carefully and patiently as we allow      Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL events to evolve.  And when they do clarify, we will act appropriately.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
26,2019-05-01,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon, and welcome.  At the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we reviewed economic and financial developments in the United States and around the world and decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged.   My colleagues and I have one overarching goal:  to use our monetary policy tools to sustain the economic expansion with a strong job market and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.  Incoming data since our last meeting in March have been broadly in line with our expectations.  Economic growth and job creation have both been a bit stronger than we anticipated, while inflation has been somewhat weaker.  Overall, the economy continues on a healthy path, and the Committee believes that the current stance of policy is appropriate.  The Committee also believes that solid underlying fundamentals are supporting the economy, including accommodative financial conditions, high employment and job growth, rising wages, and strong consumer and business sentiment.  Job gains rebounded in March after a weak reading in February and averaged 180,000 per month in the first quarter, well above the pace needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force.  Although first-quarter GDP rose more than most forecasters had expected, growth in private consumption and business fixed investment slowed.  Recent data suggest that these two components will bounce back, supporting our expectation of healthy GDP growth over the rest of the year.   The Committee is strongly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  For much of this long expansion, inflation ran a bit below our 2 percent objective, alongside considerable slack in resource utilization.  But last year, with the unemployment rate at or below 4 percent, inflation moved up.  From March through December, core inflation—which excludes volatile food and energy components—was at or very close to 2 percent.  Overall inflation  May 1, 2019  fluctuated from a few tenths above 2 percent to a few tenths below over this period, with the    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL moves mostly due to changes in energy prices.  As expected, overall inflation fell at the start of this year as earlier oil price declines worked through the system.  Overall inflation for the 12 months ended in March was 1.5 percent.  Core inflation unexpectedly fell as well, however, and as of March stood at 1.6 percent for the previous 12 months.  We suspect that some transitory factors may be at work.  Thus, our baseline view remains that, with a strong job market and continued growth, inflation will return to 2 percent over time and then be roughly symmetric around our longer-term objective.   At the start of the year, a number of crosscurrents presented risks to the outlook, including weak global growth, particularly in China and Europe; the possibility of a disruptive Brexit; and uncertainty around unresolved trade negotiations.  While concerns remain in all of these areas, it appears that risks have moderated somewhat.  Global financial conditions have eased, supported in many places around the world by an accommodative shift in monetary policy and, in some cases, fiscal policy.  Recent data from China and Europe show some improvement, and the prospect of a disorderly Brexit has been pushed off for now.  Further, there are reports of progress in the trade talks between the United States and China.  The Committee views these developments, along with the outlook for continued growth, a strong job market, and muted inflation pressures, as consistent with continued patience in assessing further adjustments in monetary policy.   Over the past several months, we have made a number of consequential decisions about our balance sheet.  In January, we decided to continue implementing monetary policy using our current policy regime, which involves providing an ample supply of reserves.  In March, we  May 1, 2019  in September.  These plans support our longer-run dual-mandate objectives and also provide    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL clarity about the path of our asset holdings.  Today we had a preliminary discussion about the longer-run maturity composition of the portfolio.  Before the financial crisis, our portfolio was weighted toward shorter-term debt of the federal government.  In the wake of the crisis, the Fed bought a large amount of longer-term securities with the aim of lowering longer-term interest rates and, thus, supporting the recovery.  Because of these purchases, our portfolio is now weighted toward longer-term securities.  As part of normalization, we will have to decide what the maturity structure should be in the longer term.  This choice raises many complex issues and has possible implications for the stance of policy.   Today’s preliminary discussion laid the groundwork for more complete analysis and discussion, and we plan to return to the maturity composition question toward the end of the year.  There is no pressing need to resolve this matter, however, and any decisions we ultimately reach will be implemented with considerable advance notice and in a manner that allows for smooth adjustment.  As we have often emphasized, adjustments to the balance sheet normalization process may well be needed as the process unfolds.   Finally, we made a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy:  the interest rate on excess reserves, or IOER rate.  The change does not reflect any shift in the intended stance of monetary policy.  We use the IOER rate to help keep the federal funds rate in our target range.  As balance sheet normalization continues, we have expected that the effective federal funds rate would shift up over time relative to the IOER rate.  Last year we twice lowered the IOER rate by 5 basis points relative to the top of the target range after the federal funds rate moved toward the top of the range.  These actions helped keep the effective federal funds rate well within the target range.  And today we made one more such  May 1, 2019  change.  The target range for the federal funds rate is our main indicator of the stance of policy,    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL and it remains unchanged.   Thank you very much.  I will be glad to take your questions.

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  As the statement noted, core inflation is now running below 2 percent—it’s been falling for three straight months, and while you’ve been close, it’s only been at 2 percent or above one month since 2012.  Mr. Chair, I guess I wonder, is it time to address low inflation through policy, and can you give us some sense of your metric for when it would be time?  At what level would it require a policy response from the Committee?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, first, we are strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation objective and to achieving it on a sustained and symmetric basis.  As I mentioned, we think our policy stance is appropriate at the moment, and we don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction.  I would point out that inflation actually ran—including core inflation—actually ran pretty close to 2 percent for much of 2018.   As you point out, both headline and core, though, did come in on the soft side in the first quarter, and that was not expected as it relates to core.  So we say in our Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent.  So “persistent” carries the sense of something that’s not transient, something that will sustain over a period of time.  And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient.  And I’d point to things like portfolio management, service prices, apparel prices, and other things.  In addition, the  May 1, 2019  trimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much.  Indeed, the Dallas trimmed mean    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL is at 2 percent.   But to go back to your question, if we did see a persistent—inflation running persistently below, then that is something the Committee would be concerned about and something that we would take into account in setting policy.  

[SECTION]

SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.  Let me carry on on the same theme.  There’s obviously been a lot of speculation in the markets about the prospects for a rate reduction this year.  Do you think markets have effectively gotten ahead of themselves on this?  And what sort of economic conditions would you need to see to give serious consideration of a rate cut?  The discussion, for example, about the 1995 example—do you actually need to see a looming recession to cut rates, or could an insurance cut be appropriate?  Thanks.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So as I mentioned, we’ve just come through a two-day meeting, and we’ve done a deep dive on economic and financial conditions in the United States and around the world and thought about our policy, and we do think our policy stance is appropriate right now.  We don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction.  So— we do, of course, though—as a routine matter, as you well know—we look not only at our baseline, but we also look at alternative simulations, both better and worse, and we ask ourselves what the appropriate policy response would be.  But that’s all we do.  And I would just say that we’re comfortable—the Committee is comfortable with our current policy stance.  

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Shifting gears a little bit, I wondered if you could flesh out—I know you’re describing it as a small technical adjustment, but on the IOER federal funds spread, give us a sense of why it matters whether or  May 1, 2019  not this breaches the upper limit a little bit.  Is there any feed-through to broader credit    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL conditions and financial conditions that you worry about, or is it simply a matter of the Fed showing that it can control what it says it’s controlling?  And I do have a follow-up.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So a small, temporary deviation outside of the range would really carry no—wouldn’t be important, as your question suggests.  But we do think it’s important that we be able to control the federal funds rate and generally keep it within the range.  That’s just good monetary policy, good monetary control.  So we think it’s important, and we have the tools to do that, so we’ve used them again today.  And, again, this is just a technical fix.  It really has no implications for policy.  

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  But as a follow-up on this, it is demonstrating that you can control the market you want to control.  And I guess the question is, at what point would these steady declines in the IOER—steady widening of this spread, if it continues, essentially become the policy choice?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, I mean—so, generally speaking, the federal funds rate—we control only directly the federal funds rate in terms of the market rate.  And the transmission of the federal funds rate into other short-term rates—money market rates—has been very good over a long period of time.  And that’s important, because it’s really broader financial conditions that matter, not so much precisely the federal funds rate.  So I think the Fed controlling the federal funds rate is actually important from that standpoint, and I don’t see us not controlling it.  So I think we’ll continue to control it, and it will continue to transmit well into broader financial 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee with Bloomberg.  I’m curious about the financial conditions that you see out there.  The minutes of the March meeting tell us “a few” officials conditions.   May 1, 2019  worried about financial stability risks.  Was there a broader discussion at this meeting?  Any    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL consensus on whether such risks are growing as the markets hit new highs, and we do see some instability in short-end trading—is it possible that rates are too low at this point?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We actually have a financial stability briefing and opportunity for comment every other meeting.  So we had our quarterly briefing today—yesterday, as a matter of fact—and had that discussion as well.  And I think there haven’t been a lot of changes since the last meeting, but I’ll just go through the way we think about it.  First, we’ve developed and published our framework for assessing financial stability vulnerabilities—put it out for comment and welcome any feedback that we get from the public.  And that enables us to focus our assessments regularly on the same things so that we can be held accountable and be transparent.   So there are four aspects of it that I’ll go through quickly, but I’d say that the headline really is that while there are some concerns around nonfinancial corporate debt, really the finding is that, overall, financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate, on balance.  And, in addition, I would say that the financial system is quite resilient to shocks of various kinds with high capital and liquidity.  But the four things we look at are, first, asset prices.  And as for asset prices, some asset prices are somewhat elevated, but I would say not extremely so.   Leverage in the financial sector—I mentioned households are actually in good shape from a leverage standpoint.  Default rates are low.  Borrowing is relatively low.  Nonfinancial corporates is an area that we’ve spotlighted and focused on for attention, and there are concerns about that—not so much from a financial stability standpoint, but from the standpoint that having a highly levered corporate sector could be an amplifier for a downturn.    May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL And then the last two—the last two things are really about the leverage in the financial system and funding risk, and those are both very, very low by historic standards in the United States.  So, on balance, in my view, vulnerabilities are moderate.  

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  If I could follow up on that—I’m just curious as to whether the level of asset prices is a reason why you might not be interested in cutting rates. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we do say that risks to the financial system—we say in our longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.  I would say that, though, that really the tools for addressing those concerns are better—capital liquidity, good supervision, good stress testing, and things like that.  Those are better first-order tools to deal with these kinds of issues than monetary policy.  

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, with the benefit of hindsight, did last year’s rate increases make it harder for the Fed to credibly affirm its 2 percent symmetric inflation target is not, in fact, a ceiling?  And, if so, would it be appropriate to lower rates if core inflation remained persistently closer to 1½ percent instead of 2 percent?  And, if not, do you worry about any unwelcome tightening in real rates, given the recent softness in core inflation?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, to your first question, if you go back and think about the middle of last year, inflation was at 2 percent and appeared to be staying there.  And the economy was quite strong and was growing strong.  The fiscal changes were hitting the economy in a very positive way.  And so I think the expectation was that inflation would remain up around 2 percent.  The weak first quarter performance was not expected—of core was not expected, and I don’t think is related to anything we did, in terms of raising rates.  It appears to be more—we  May 1, 2019  don’t know this, but you never know until—with hindsight, with perfect hindsight, but some of it    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL does appear to be transient or idiosyncratic.  Now, the second part of your question?  Sorry.  

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Well, I mean, if it was an issue, would it be appropriate to lower rates if core inflation held closer to 1½ percent?  And, if not, are you worried that there is unwanted tightening from real rates, being where they are?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, I mean—so, as I said earlier, we do address this in our, sort of, constitutional document.  If inflation were to run persistently below 2 percent or persistently above 2 percent, that would be a concern for the Committee, and the Committee would take that into account in making policy.  I do think it’s important that inflation run close to and sustainably —for a sustained period of time—and symmetrically around 2 percent.  Because if it doesn’t, you run the risk that inflation expectations can—it has been the case, most of the misses are on the downside—inflation expectations over time could be pulled down, and that could put downward pressure on inflation and make it harder for us to react to downturns and harder for us to, you know, support the economy in difficult times.  

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.  So as you just mentioned, last year when you guys were kind of getting inflation coming in around 2 percent, you had this benefit of the tailwind of fiscal stimulus.  And you still have that to some extent, although the tax cuts have mostly feeded through—we’ve still got something in the pipeline from the spending cap increases.  So, I guess, how do you think about inflation as that fiscal benefit wanes toward the end of this year?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Inflation, first of all—month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter—is going to move around.  There will always be factors hitting it.  So probably the biggest single factor driving it is the rate of underlying inflation or the closely related idea of where inflation  May 1, 2019  expectations are anchored—the thought being, that’s where inflation will go in the long run if it’s    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL not been pushed by those other factors.  So we also think that slack—the level of slack in the economy does play some small role.  It’s actually still a measurable role.  It’s nothing like it was in the 1960s when the Phillips curve was quite steep, so that’s also something that plays a role.   And so we take all those things into account, and the part of it that we can control is the slack part.  And, again, we do expect that this reading will be transient and inflation will move back up.  And if it isn’t and if it runs persistently below 2 percent for a sustained period, then that’s something we’d take into account in setting policy.  

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN.  Pivoting a little bit—about wages, since 2010, women’s real earnings have gone up about 3.9 percent compared to men’s, which have risen about 2.1.  Do you think the relative increase in women’s wages is a problem for the U.S. economy?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I think, generally, I’d have to see the data on that.  It sounds like you picked a particular time frame.  Over time, I really wonder whether that’s the case.  You know, I think men and women should make the same for the same work, by and large.  So— 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Just to push a little bit on this.  But if the data shows that women’s wages are rising higher, is there a damage to the U.S. economy if male’s wages are declining or not growing as fast as women’s?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I think we’re getting in here to commenting on a nominee to the Fed indirectly, and that’s something I’d rather avoid.  It’s really not my role to engage with potential nominees to the Fed, so I’m really not going to go there.  I haven’t seen this research either, so I don’t really—really know.  Thanks.  May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  I wanted to ask—early last month, I believe it was April 2, the Fedwire® system went down.  And I was just wondering if you could talk about what happened there, how long it lasted, whether you know what happened, whether you’re still looking into it, and whether it’s something that could happen again.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So that’s right.  I want to say it was April 1, but it may have been April 2.  In any case, the Fedwire® did go down for a few hours, in the three- or four-hour range.  We were able to quickly identify the problem:  It was an internal problem, and we were able to correct it and make changes so that that problem and other problems like it cannot repeat themselves.  So, you know, we learn from these instances.  They’re fairly rare, but we learn from them, and in this case it was internal, and it’s been corrected.  

[SECTION]

STEVE MATTHEWS.  Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.  Next month, we have the 10th anniversary of the end of the recession, and there are some countries that have had expansions for 15, 20, 25 years.  Do you think that’s something that’s practical for the U.S., that we could have that kind of lengthy expansion?  And for you personally, if we had a recession during your tenure, would you consider that a failure?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I wouldn’t want to speculate.  There’s always the example of Australia that everyone, I think, is aware of, where I think they’re in year 28 of their expansion.  So things are possible.  All I can see is that we have an economy where the expansion is continuing.  Growth is at a healthy level.  The labor market is strong.  We see job creation.  We see wages moving up.  Inflation is low, which gives us the ability to be patient, and we do expect it to move up, and we want it to move up to 2 percent.  So I see us on a good path for this year.   May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

STEVE MATTHEWS.  Do you see parallels with the 1990s, when—for example, some people have pointed out, in the U.S., the longest expansion before this one, there was a rate cut in 1995, and rates went up, and then they came down, and there was that kind of management.  Do you see similarities in today’s situation?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Similarities in the length.  I mean, the situations were quite different then.  This was before inflation really was under control, but, you know, it’s very interesting to look at the history.  I find it quite interesting to look at different periods.  But I think, in our own cycle, we face a particular set of challenges that are really what’s relevant for us now.  repeatedly said that the Fed’s going to conduct monetary policy without regard to outside political pressure, but it seems like the President is intent on increasing that political pressure.  Yesterday, he said you should cut rates a full percentage point and start quantitative easing.  What do those comments do, in terms of affecting how you pursue policy and how you convey your decisions to the public?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, so, as you know, we are a nonpolitical institution, and that means we don’t think about short-term political considerations, we don’t discuss them, and we don’t consider them in making our decisions one way or the other.  And what we’re always solving for in our process, in our work, is to carry out our mission, which is to extend the economic expansion, keep the labor market strong, and get inflation around 2 percent.  So to give you an idea of what our process is like, maybe as a way of putting all that in context—so for the past maybe 10 days, all 17 FOMC members will have made extensive preparations:  catching up on the latest data, reading all the memos, talking to their colleagues and their staff.  As you also are I’m sure aware, Marty, we talk to literally thousands of  May 1, 2019  businesspeople and market people and people in the nonprofit sector and the educational sector    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL just to get a better sense of the economy.  We put all that together, and we come together for two days.  The first day begins with an economic briefing, which is, sort of, economic and financial developments in the United States and around the world.  That takes up most of the first day, and we talk about this in great detail.  We go away, we think about that, and we come back, and the next day we talk about monetary policy.  And in this particular case, we came to a unanimous And we think our monetary policy stance is in a good place, and we’re going to be patient as we consider adjustments.  And we also see, by the way, the evolving-risk picture as very consistent with that outlook.  So we don’t feel like the data’s pushing us in either direction.  Of course, we’ll not hesitate if we do feel that the data justify moving in either direction.  But that’s our process.  That’s how we think about things.  We don’t think about other factors.  We don’t let them into our decisionmaking.  We don’t discuss them.  

[SECTION]

PAUL KIERNAN.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.  Thanks for the question.  In the last 23 years, core PCE inflation has run above 2 percent only during the period that coincided with the housing bubble.  I’d like to know what you would say to people who worry that it will prove difficult for the Fed to lift inflation without potentially stoking another asset bubble of some sort.  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So you’re pointing to, really, the fact that in recent years inflation has moved down and down, and, really, many major central banks have struggled to reach their inflation goals from below.  And that includes us, although we’ve actually done— May 1, 2019  we’ve come closer, I think, than most others.  And it’s just a question, I think, of demographic    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL and other large and, in some cases, global forces that are disinflationary to some extent, and it creates significant challenges.  One, I would say, is, it means that interest rates will be lower—will be closer to the effective lower bound more of the time because that means lower interest rates.  And that’s one of the reasons we’re having a review of our monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications this year—to think about that problem.  You mentioned the connection to financial stability of lower-for-longer rates, and that is another challenge.  As I mentioned earlier, we do consider financial stability concerns to the extent they threaten achievement of our goals, but we also view, and I do take the view that macroprudential and supervisory tools, regulatory tools, things like the stress tests that we can do right through the cycle—those are really the best defense against financial instability so that the financial system is highly resilient to the kinds of financial shocks that can happen.

GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  This morning, the ISM manufacturing index fell to have its worst reading since October 2016.  So isn’t that a dark cloud on your outlook for strong growth for the rest of the year?  I mean, how much weight does it hold for you, and is it a sign that monetary policy might be too tight?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  This is the ISM reading, I guess from this morning, on manufacturing.  Yes, we see that reading as—it’s still a positive reading and consistent with what we expect from the manufacturing sector, which is moderate or perhaps modest growth.  Manufacturing has been weak all around the world.  Services have been growing faster.  So it’s—yes, it’s something that we are watching carefully, but we do expect a positive contribution to growth from the manufacturing sector.   May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for doing this.  You mentioned—talked about domestic growth a little bit with the economy.  You mentioned that the progress in the talks with China trade, progress in talks with Japanese trade, the USMCA is moving or going to move through Congress.  Could you talk about a little bit of the domestic growth that you’re seeing going forward for the rest of the year?  And could these trade deals turn into tailwinds for the economy?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Our outlook and my outlook is for—is a positive one, is a healthy one for the U.S. economy for growth for the rest of this year.  And I would say that the basis for that, really, is consumer spending and business investment.  So if you look at consumer spending, you saw stronger retail sales, stronger motor vehicle sales in March.  And, as I mentioned, the conditions, the broader economic fundamentals, are strong in support of consumer spending—that’s more accommodative financial conditions, high confidence readings, high levels of employment, wages going up.  All those things are going to support consumer spending.  So that’s a significant part of the outlook this year.  And business investment should also be positive in that sort of direction.  In terms of the effect of trade deals, I think one thing would be that the resolution of the uncertainty around these trade negotiations would, I would guess, be a positive for business sentiment.  We have been hearing from our business contacts, really, a lot since the beginning of the trade negotiations that uncertainty is a concern.  If you import metals or whatever for your product or export your product, then it’s been a challenge for you.  So that would be a positive.  And, of course, most of the gains, though, I would expect, even from a successful trade negotiation, would come in over time.  You know, I don’t think—it wouldn’t be the kind of thing where you’d immediately feel big effects right away, but they could be quite important over a  May 1, 2019  longer period.  So that, I think—that would be my expectation.  I don’t know, though.  I haven’t    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL seen—none of us, at least I haven’t seen, the details of what’s been negotiated.  

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times.  Getting back to inflation, can you talk more about the transitory factors holding down inflation, how significant they are, and why you think those factors will pass?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  Well, I would just mention a couple.  Let me say, I don’t mean to diminish concerns about too-low inflation, but I think there’s good reason to think that these readings are particularly influenced by some transitory factors.  One that I would mention is portfolio management services, which would tend to go down when asset prices go down, with a lag.  And so when asset prices went back up, probably there’ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution.  Other ones that get mentioned are things like apparel, and apparel prices were very, very low.  There was a change in the methodology.  And another one is airfares.  There are many little things.  So we don’t know until, again, until we see, but there’s reason to think that those would be transient and would turn around.  And another way to look at it is, there are models that look at inflation in different ways, like—not models, but measures, like the Dallas trimmed mean, as I mentioned.  So trimmed mean—it cuts off the big movements on the upside and the downside and looks at just the mean movements in inflation of various product categories and service categories, and it didn’t go down at all.  It’s at 2 percent—or it’s at, I don’t know whether it went down or was above that, but it’s at 2 percent now.  So there’s reason to think that these will be transient.  We, of course, will be watching very carefully to see that that is the case.  I would point to the case of cell phone services.  Many of you will remember, in March of 2017, there was a  May 1, 2019  very low reading for cell phone services—mobile phone services—and it was kind of a price    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL war, and it dragged down core inflation for a full year, but it did not look like something that would be repeated.  And we kind of thought so and said so, and then, sure enough, in 2018, we had those months of 2 percent inflation.  So, again, we’ll have to see here.  We’re going to be watching—really, I’d like to say we’re going to be watching inflation carefully to see that these things are transient, and I’ll end by saying we are strongly committed to the 2 percent inflation objective.

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Just following up, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  You were saying if inflation does stay low and these low inflation rates are not transient, you said a couple times you’ll take that into account with monetary policy.  How, specifically, will you take that into account?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, it’s hard to say, because there’s so many other variables.  Ultimately, there are many variables to be taken into account at any given time, but that’s part of our mandate.  Stable prices is half of our mandate, and we’ve defined that as 2 percent.  So we would be concerned, and we’d take it into account.

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  So a cut in interest rates would be possible?

JEAN YUNG.  Hi, Jean Yung with Market News.  If the fed funds rate keeps rising, do you see room for another IOER adjustment?  And then, can you speak to any other strategies or tools that might be useful for keeping a ceiling on short-term interest rates?  There have been other ideas floated, like the standing repo facility and targeting a different benchmark rate.  May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  If we need to, and as needed, we will use our tools to keep the federal funds rate somewhere in the target range.  We’ll do that.  Don’t expect to need to do it again, but we don’t know.  I mean, we’re—with—the balance sheet is now—the size of it is going to be driven by demand for liabilities, principally reserves, as I mentioned.  And we’re right at that point where we’re starting to learn more and more about what the real demand for reserves is over the next few months.  And so I—there is no template for this.  There’s no roadmap.  We just have to do it, and that’s why we’re moving so very gradually.  It’s why we tapered the roll-off to only $15 billion in Treasuries per month.  Effective, I guess, today, we’re cutting the roll-off rate for Treasuries in half just because we want to take our time and move gradually here.  So that’s that.  In terms of other tools, we’re actually—I’m sure at an upcoming meeting we will be looking at the idea of a repo facility.  I don’t have any presupposition that it’s something we would do, but we’ll be taking a look at it as a possible addition to our toolbox.  Again, I wouldn’t say—it would just be a way for us to do what we do, which is to do a deep dive on it, think carefully about it, look at the pros and cons, look at the different possible ways to do it, and then go away and think about it for a little while.  And then probably come back and make a decision.  But that’s something we’ll do at an upcoming meeting, I would imagine.

So given what you’ve said about the expectations for consumption and also business fixed investment perhaps bouncing back in the next GDP reading, I’m wondering if you think that continued growth in economic activity might show some sort of underlying fundamental that could flag another overheating.  For example, the median projection in the March meeting for GDP growth for 2019 was 2.1, so I’m just kind of curious about what you see going forward if we continue to see strong GDP numbers.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, we don’t see any evidence at all of overheating, for one thing.  We see inflation below 2 percent now—as I mentioned, pretty close to 2 percent for most of last year.  So, really, no signs of overheating.  If you look at the labor market, for a long time now there have been anecdotal reports of labor shortages and difficulty in finding skilled labor and that kind of thing.  Nonetheless, you have very strong job creation, and you have wages moving up at a rate that is appropriate, given inflation and given productivity, but not at all signaling any overheating at all.  It’s not higher than that rate that would incorporate both inflation and productivity.  So, really not seeing signs of overheating at the moment.  

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Are wages ever going to get back above 4 percent in this cycle?  Can you kind of give us a read on—but more substantively, can you give us a read on how the Committee views productivity growth, if it’s accelerating enough?   May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes—in terms of wages getting over 4 percent, wages have moved up pretty steadily over the last five years and are now—wages and benefits are now between 3 and 3½ percent.  Just for the last couple of years, the biggest part of the gains have come for people at the lowest end of compensation and education, which is kind of a welcome thing.  You mentioned productivity.  So productivity is really very difficult to predict.  No one has been able to predict it successfully, so I won’t really try.  But I will say this:  Productivity was very, very low in the wake of the crisis for six or seven years.  Last year, we had 1.9 percent productivity, which is much higher.  I don’t know if that level can be sustained, but we really—it’s driven, to some extent, by technological developments and, really, the diffusion of technology through the economy, and it’s very hard to predict.  So I think it’s positive.  In fact, I’ll mention, if we’re talking about the supply side, labor force participation.  Really, there has been a significant positive supply-side development over the last year and a half between the uptick in labor force participation, which goes back several years, but also productivity.  And that does suggest more room to grow.  It suggests that a less tight economy, a less, you know—may be part of the explanation for lower inflation.  Thanks very much.   ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
27,2019-06-19,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon, and welcome.  My colleagues and I have one overarching goal:  to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people.    At the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we maintained our policy interest rate but made some significant changes to our statement.  Since the beginning of the year, we have judged that our current policy stance was broadly appropriate and that we should be patient in assessing the need for any changes.  In light of increased uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, we now emphasize that the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its 2 percent objective. I’d like to step back and review how the changing economic and financial picture brings us to today’s decision.  So far this year, the economy has performed reasonably well, with solid fundamentals supporting continued growth and strong employment.  Inflation has been running somewhat below our objective, but we have expected it to pick up, supported by solid growth and a strong job market.  Along with this favorable picture, we have been mindful of some ongoing crosscurrents, including trade developments and concerns about global growth.  At the time of our last FOMC meeting, which ended on May 1, there was tentative evidence that these crosscurrents were moderating.  The latest data from China and Europe were encouraging, and there were reports of progress in trade negotiations with China.  Our continued patient stance seemed appropriate, and the Committee saw no strong case for adjusting our policy rate. In the weeks since our last meeting, the crosscurrents have reemerged.  Growth indicators from around the world have disappointed, on net, raising concerns about the strength of the  June 19, 2019  global economy.  Apparent progress on trade turned to greater uncertainty, and our contacts in    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments.  These concerns starting to show through to incoming data.  Risk sentiment in financial markets has deteriorated as well.  Against this backdrop, inflation remains muted. While the baseline outlook remains favorable, the question is whether these uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook and thus call for additional monetary policy accommodation.  Many FOMC participants now see that the case for a somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened.  Let me explain the basis for this judgment, starting with the outlook for jobs and growth. Participants see unemployment remaining low this year and next.  Monthly job gains in watching.  Still, many labor market indicators remain strong.  Community, business, and labor leaders all tell us that the prospects for job seekers have seldom been better, and that this is true even for those who have traditionally struggled to find work.  Wages are rising, and this is particularly so for lower-paying jobs. Committee participants’ growth projections from 2019 are little revised from March, with a central tendency of 2 percent to 2.2 percent, just above their estimates of longer-run normal growth.  The growth projections for the year as a whole mask some important details about the composition of growth.  Annual growth will be boosted by the surprisingly strong first quarter, which had just been reported at the time of the May FOMC meeting.  As I noted then, the unexpected strength was largely in net exports and inventories—components that are not generally reliable indicators of ongoing momentum.  The more reliable drivers of growth in the  June 19, 2019  economy are spending on consumption and business investment.  While consumption was weak    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  in the first quarter, incoming data show that it has bounced back and is now running at a solid pace.  In contrast, the limited evidence available at this time suggests that growth in business fixed income has slowed in the second quarter.1  Moreover, manufacturing production has posted participants cited the investment picture and weaker business sentiment and the crosscurrents I mentioned earlier as supporting their judgment that the risk of less favorable outcomes has risen. After running close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for most of last year, inflation inflation moving back up toward our 2 percent objective, but at a slower pace than had been expected.  The central tendency for 2019 core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy components, is between 1.7 and 1.8 percent. Setting aside short-term fluctuations, Committee participants expressed concerns about the pace of inflation’s return to 2 percent.  Wages are rising, as noted above, but not at a pace that would provide much upward impetus to inflation.  Moreover, weaker global growth may continue to hold inflation down around the world. We are firmly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, and we are well aware that inflation weakness that persists even in a healthy economy could precipitate a difficult-to-arrest downward drift in longer-run inflation expectations.  Because there are no definitive measures of inflation expectations, we must rely on imperfect proxies.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved down since our May meeting, and some survey-based expectations measures are near the bottom of their historic ranges.  Combining these                                                  1 Chair Powell intended to say that growth in business fixed investment slowed in the second quarter.  June 19, 2019  factors with the risks to growth already noted, participants expressed concerns about a more    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL sustained shortfall of inflation. Overall, our policy discussions focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment.  The projections of appropriate policy show that many participants believe that some cut in the federal funds rate will be appropriate in the scenario that they see as most likely.  Though some participants wrote down policy cuts and others did not, our deliberations made clear that a number of those who wrote down a flat rate path agree that the case for additional accommodation has strengthened since our May meeting.  This added accommodation would support economic activity and inflation’s return to our objective. Uncertainties surrounding the baseline outlook have clearly risen since our last meeting.  It is important, however, that monetary policy not overreact to any individual data point or short-term swing in sentiment.  Doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook.  Thus, my colleagues and I will be looking to see whether these uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook, and we will use our tools as appropriate to sustain the expansion. Thank you. I will be pleased to take your questions. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, did you consider a rate cut today?  Specifically, was it one of the options—the policy options in the Tealbook?  And is the Committee considering moving, given all the uncertainty you addressed, moving its—changing its policy before the next meeting? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So the Committee had, you know, our usual long discussion of global and domestic economic and financial conditions and then spent this morning talking about monetary policy.  And I came to the view that I expressed to you, which is that we’re going to be monitoring—monitoring the crosscurrents and the other items that we’ve mentioned, but that  June 19, 2019  we’d like to see more going forward.  Particularly, we’d like to see whether these risks continue    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  to weigh on the outlook. So, generally, as I mentioned, many on the Committee do see a strengthened case—eight of those, a strengthened case for cutting rates.  Eight actually wrote down rate cuts.  A number of others see that the case has strengthened.  But the Committee wanted to see more, as I mentioned.  And I also mentioned that some of these—some of these developments have been of quite recent vintage.  And so we do expect that we’ll be learning a lot more on all of these issues in the near term.  And that’s our focus. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Do you think something could change before the next meeting? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I’m sure that things will change before the next meeting.  I expect a full range of data and information on all of these issues that we are looking at.  I think we’ll learn a great deal more about them.  And I think that’s—we think that that’s the right way to move here.  Again, many of these developments happened, you know, part of the way through the last intermeeting period.  Only seven weeks ago, we had a great jobs report and came out of the last FOMC meeting feeling that the economy, and our policy, was in a good place.  So we want to see—we want to see and we want to react to developments and trends that are sustained, that are genuine, and not react just to data points or just to changes in sentiment, which can be volatile.  At the same time, we are—we’re quite mindful of the risks to the outlook and are prepared to move and use our tools as needed to sustain the expansion. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Could you walk us through your thinking about trade?  It was really the threat of tariffs against Mexico that caused at least the market to become definitively banking, or—pricing in rate cuts.  If, for example, there’s a deal with China, does that take the possibility of rate cuts off the table?  June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, so I would say that we’re not looking at any one thing.  I guess I would start by agreeing with your premise that news about trade has been an important driver of sentiment in the intermeeting period.  But we’re also looking at global growth.  It’s really trade developments and concerns about global growth that are on our minds. So we’re not exclusively focused on one event or one piece of data.  Risks seem to have grown.  In the meantime, we have incoming data in the United States that’s been pretty good, particularly for the consumer:  Consumer spending is solid supported by, you know, a healthy job market, high levels of employment, wages going up.  We do see, though, some areas that we’re looking at, such as, I mentioned, business fixed income.2  So—also, the prolonged shortfall in inflation and perhaps job growth—we don’t like to look at one job report.  We like to average over three or six months, but still that bears watching. So we’ll be monitoring the implications of all of those developments for the U.S. economic outlook.  We expect to learn a good deal more, as I mentioned.  And we’ll be asking the question whether those risks are going to continue to weigh on the outlook.  And then, in the end, we’ll use our tools as appropriate to sustain this long expansion.

HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post.  Could you clarify what you would do if the President tweets or calls you to say he would like to demote you as Fed Chair? to serve it.

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I was hoping that—this is Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.  I was hoping that you could clarify for us a little bit how you’re thinking                                                  2 Chair Powell intended to say “business fixed investment.”  June 19, 2019  about the risks of waiting too long to cut rates versus the risks of cutting rates prematurely—sort    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  of, what the balance of risks are and how you talk about that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So we’re always trying to balance that risk, but I would say that, given the quite recent nature of some of the events, I think the Committee felt, though, that the right thing to do was to wait and see more.  And we will see a lot more on all of these issues in the very near term.  So I don’t think the risk of waiting too long is prominent right now.  I would say, as a general matter, it’s always something that we have to weigh.  But I think we believe that the right thing here is to watch carefully in the near term and see how these risks unfold and see whether they continue to weigh on the outlook. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  [Inaudible] 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Obviously, we try to avoid going prematurely as well.  In this case, you know, there’s always some judgment in these things.  But I would just say that the risks that we see having emerged are risks that have gotten our attention and that have called a number of us to write down rate cuts, and a number of those who haven’t to see that the case has strengthened. forward? your time as Chairman.  Does that give us a sense that there was debate among a group that was pushing for a rate cut this time?  And how do you—do you expect further dissents going 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Let me let me say the same thing as I said the last time, before there had been any dissents, and that is that I think the process of careful, thoughtful dissent is a very healthy one, and I’ve always believed that.  And I feel like you make better decisions when you  June 19, 2019  hear a disparity of views.  So I really do look at it that way.  I would add, though, that the support    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  for the path we took for the policy statement that we adopted was quite broad. 

[SECTION]

JAMES POLITI.  James Politi with the Financial Times.  Mario Draghi at the ECB yesterday sent a strong signal of new stimulus for the euro zone.  Do you think that such actions to ease policy at other central banks around the world will put more pressure on the Fed to do the same? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, first, I think all central banks are focused on their domestic—their mandates are domestic, and they’re focused on economic conditions from a domestic standpoint.  And that goes for the European Central Bank, it goes for the Fed, it goes for all central banks.  So that’s our principal focus.  So it could cut either way.  You know, I would think that, to the extent you see stronger financial conditions and stronger activity in the ECB after a rate cut, that would support—tend to support activity.3  So we’re really focused on, you know, the risks to our—on the baseline outlook, which is still a pretty favorable one, and the risks to those outlooks.  That’s our principal focus. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks.  This is the first time that you’ve been really issuing there concern that you’ll be causing a sort of “dot deflation” by telling people, “Well, don’t buy your car now, because it’ll get cheaper in six months because we’re cutting rates,” and that that could sort of fulfill itself?  And, secondly, on inflation, that was a pretty big drop in expected PCE, yet, you know, without reacting to it, are you not sort of undermining your own credibility in terms of commitment to the 2 percent target?                                                  3 Chair Powell intended to say “stronger activity in the euro area.”     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I’ll take the inflation one first.  I didn’t quite follow your “dot” 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Well, the fact that expected inflation went from 1.8 to—Howard Schneider with Reuters—went from 1.8 to 1.5, it’s the fact that you’re not responding to  question. that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  That’s the inflation question. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Yes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I’m saying you— 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  On def—no, the fact that you’ve signaled rate cuts are coming.  Or is—was there any concern on the Committee that this would tell consumers, tell people, “Don’t borrow now, don’t spend now, because rates will get cheaper later”? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I see.  Okay, right.  Okay.  So let me let me answer the inflation question first.  So we’re saying that we know—I noted in the statement and also in my—what I said here.  We saw that market-based measures of inflation expectations, breakevens, dropped.  We noted that also in the statement.  And I noted it as a reason for us to—one of several reasons why it feels to us that the case for more accommodation has strengthened.  So we find that notable.  Not only that, the actual forecast for inflation for this year, among FOMC participants, dropped a couple of tenths.  So that means a more prolonged shortfall of inflation. Let me say, on inflation, it’s something I’ve been concerned about for quite a long time.  It’s one of the principal reasons why I called for the review.  In a world where policy rates are going to be closer to the effective lower bound, then, just as a general matter, we need to be really strong on 2 percent inflation.  So I think, you know, we certainly don’t want to be seen as weak on inflation, and I don't believe we are.  June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL In terms of the dots, you’re right, this is the first time, I believe, we’ve had—we’ve talked about cutting in the “dot era.”  I guess the dot era began in January 2012.  And, you know, we’re working our way through it.  And I think it’s just something we do.  You know that my view on the dots is that they, overall, provide useful information for people, but that we need to do our absolute best to explain what they are and what they are not. Speaking of which, they are not a forecast of the group, they’re not discussed or debated at the meeting, they’re an input to policy more than an output of policy, and they’re also only the most likely case.  So, in a situation where there’s relatively high uncertainty, there’s the most likely case, but the second most likely case might only be a little bit less likely.  But that doesn’t show up in the dot.  The dot is either one thing or it’s another.  So I just would say that, if you pay too close attention to the dots, then you may lose sight of the larger picture. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER CONDON.  Thank you.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Mr. Chairman, if and when the Committee decides to cut rates, I suspect there’ll be a debate over whether to move by 25 or 50 basis points.  Indeed, there’s a pretty substantial body of academic literature arguing that a central bank close to the zero lower bound ought to act sooner and more aggressively than it otherwise would.  I’m wondering what you think of that prescription, and if you could spend a couple of minutes discussing the pros and cons of the 50 basis point cut and how you approach that question. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  On the specific question of that, that’s just something we haven’t really engaged with yet, and it will depend very heavily on incoming data and the evolving risk  June 19, 2019  picture as we move forward.  So it would be—so nothing I can say about that is specific to the    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL near-term question that we face. More generally, though, the research you refer to essentially notes that, in a world where you are closer to the effective lower bound, it’s why—research kind of shows this—it’s wise to react, for example, to prevent a weakening from turning into a prolonged weakening.  In other words, sort of, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  So I think that is a valid way to think about policy in this era.  I don’t know—and it’s always in the—I think it’s in the minds of policymakers, you know, during this era, because it’s well understood to be correct.  Again, I don’t know what that means in terms of the size of a particular rate cut going forward.  That’s going to depend heavily upon, you know, the actual data and the evolving risk picture. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak with CNN.  Thanks, Chairman Powell.  Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has provided a proposal to revalue the U.S. dollar in order to address concerns about rising trade deficits.  The President himself has routinely complained about the strength of the U.S. dollar, saying it has resulted in, quote, “tremendous,” close quote, competitive advantage with countries like China and others.  Do you think that an overvalued dollar has been a drag on America’s global competitiveness?  And would you support an intervention of some kind on this issue? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  The U.S. Treasury has responsibility for exchange rate policy, not the Fed, and we don’t comment, in that sense, on the level of the dollar.  We have the responsibility for maximum employment and stable prices, and we use our tools to achieve that.   June 19, 2019  Of course, we do that through changing financial conditions, and one of those is the dollar, but    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL we don’t target the dollar.  It’s just something that we don’t do. In fact, central banks—or, rather, nations, when they get together, routinely adopt a communique that says we will target our domestic, economic, and financial conditions and not our exchange rate in using monetary policy, and that includes the United States, that includes the G-20 communique that we adopted 10 days ago.  So I’m not the right person to ask about that sort of dollar policy intervention. 

[SECTION]

PAUL KIERNAN.  Thank you, Chairman Powell.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones.  If the most—according to the dot plot, I mean—if the most likely case is that you will have to cut rates in the next 18 months and given some of the concerns about, you know, policy needing to react sooner and more aggressively, what would have been the downsides to cutting rates now?  Why not just cut them now? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, why not now?  And, I would say, there was not much support for cutting rates now at this meeting.  There was, as you see, a number of people wrote down rate cuts.  But all of those, but apparently one, felt that it would be better to see more to—before moving.  And I gave a couple of reasons why that is the case.  First, it’s just the fact that some of these developments are so recent that we want to see whether they’ll sustain.  So we felt that it would be better to get a clearer picture of things, and that we would, in fact, learn a lot about these developments in the near term.  Ultimately, the question we’re going to be asking ourselves is, are these risks going to be continuing to weigh on the outlook?  And we will act as needed, including promptly, if that’s appropriate, and use our tools to expand—to sustain the expansion. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Yes.  Thank you for doing this, Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.  How do you reconcile the conflicting economic data coming in?   June 19, 2019  You know, on one hand, you have strong overall growth.  Consumer spending is strong.  On the    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  other hand, manufacturing numbers were a little bit weaker, you have growth in jobs but coming in a little weaker, and then you have low inflation.  And then, specifically, what data are you looking at that you decided not to have a rate cut?  Why didn’t you do that?  [0:24:15.5] 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, you gave a pretty good picture.  I mean, it’s a complicated picture, and, you know, the answer is, we look at all of it.  But I would say, the big pieces of it are this:  The baseline outlook has been a good one, and that has basically been consumer spending coming back up in the second quarter.  That is coming true.  And consumer spending is at a healthy level, and that makes sense.  You’ve got a tight labor market.  You’ve got companies in surveys saying that labor is scarce.  You’ve got workers in surveys saying that jobs are plentiful.  You’ve got wages going up.  You’ve got high levels of household confidence.  So, all of that, underlying fundamentals for the consumer spending part of the economy, which is 70 percent of the economy, is quite solid.  Job creation, if you take a three-month average, is still well above, you know, the entry—level of entry into the workforce.  So that part of the economy is solid. You mentioned manufacturing, and we’re seeing this all around the world.  Manufacturing, investment, and trade have been weaker.  It’s not solely a domestic issue, and it China has done over the last couple of years in working to bring down its leverage.  Some of it investment, although they’re also leading to lower gas prices, which supports spending.  So there are many, many things.  There isn’t any one thing that explains it all.  But it’s something that  June 19, 2019  we’re watching.  But you do see growth in services, so you—this pattern around the world of    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL weak manufacturing but growth in the far larger part of the services economy, which has led to low unemployment, good job creation, rising wages, that’s kind of the two big pieces of it that you see. the outlook. Then you see the crosscurrents.  If you lay the crosscurrents on top of that—concerns about global growth and trade developments—you have the full picture.  And I think what that picture—what we took away from that picture is that we’d like to see more, that we do see these risks, and what we want to do is, we want to watch and see whether they continue to weigh upon 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee, Bloomberg Television and Radio.  If consumer spending is solid and business investment has been slowed by uncertainty, I’d like to get your thinking on what a Fed rate cut would do?  Have you modeled the additional growth and inflation you might get from a rate cut?  Can you identify any sectors that would benefit from a lower cost of capital?  Or is this really about the Fed being the only game in town? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, we have the tools we have, and we’re committed and sworn to use them to support economic activity.  And they do support economic activity through a number of channels that are reasonably well understood—some more directly tied to interest rates than others.  But we do generally believe that—that our interest rate policy can support demand and support business investment as well.  And so we will use those tools and use them as we see as appropriate to achieve our objectives, which really are to sustain this expansion, and I would just make a note of that. The reason why we say “sustain the expansion” is, you’re seeing now, for the first time, you know, communities that are being brought into the benefits of this expansion that hadn’t  June 19, 2019  been earlier.  You’re 10 years deep into this, and that’s something we heard quite a lot at the    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL conference in Chicago on the review.  And I just would say, that’s why we think—it’s one of the reasons why we think it’s so important to sustain the expansion, keep it going, because we really are benefiting groups that haven’t seen, you know, this kind of prosperity in a long time. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  But given your description of the crosscurrents, do you think Fed policy can solve those problems? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we take the—you know, we take the crosscurrents as a given, and we have our tools.  You know, we don’t—we react to anything in principle that could undermine our achievement of our dual-mandate goals—maximum employment, stable prices—is worthy of our attention and can call forth a policy response.  And that’s just how we look at it. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.  You’ve said that the Fed doesn’t take short-term political considerations into account, and you’ve defended the Fed’s independence.  So I was wondering, is there a point at which you think that, publicly or privately, you should push back on the President’s criticisms rather than ignoring him?  And also, do you think that you and the President have the same goals when it comes to monetary policy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I don’t—I don’t discuss elected officials publicly or privately, really.  So I would just say that we are—at the Fed, we’re deeply committed to carrying out our mission, and also that our independence from direct political control we see as an important institutional feature that has served both the economy and the country well. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, are you concerned that new digital currencies like Libra, which Facebook unveiled this  June 19, 2019  week, could undermine the Fed and erode your power to influence the economy?  And did    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL anyone from Facebook talk with anyone at the Fed before Libra was unveiled this week? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, on your specific question of digital currencies replacing central bank currencies, I think we’re a long way from that.  And, of course, the—so I think we’re a long way from that.  Digital currencies are in their infancy.  So, essentially, not too concerned about, you know, the central banks no longer being able to carry out monetary policy because of cryptocurrencies or digital currencies. You know, Facebook, I believe, has made quite broad rounds in—around the world really with regulators, supervisors, and lots of people to discuss their plans, and that certainly includes us.  And we’re—you know, it’s something we’re looking at.  We meet with a broad range of private-sector firms all the time on financial technology, and there’s just a tremendous amount of innovation going on out there.  You know, there are potential benefits here.  There are also potential risks, particularly of a currency that could, you know, that could potentially have large application.  So I would echo what Governor Carney said, which is that we will wind up having quite high expectations, from a sort of safety and soundness and regulatory standpoint, if they do Libra then?

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Chairman Powell.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  I want to take you back to Chicago and the review of your monetary policy strategy.  And something interesting, I think, is developing, is that outside experts are excited and are—like the idea of the Fed shifting your inflation target up to 4 percent—around there, roughly, I guess.  They think that that would, you know, help monetary policy, and that there’s no—2 percent is not, like, sanctimonious or anything, or whatever, sacred.  It seems that you’ve taken that off the table.  So I was wondering if you could discuss that.  Have you taken it off the table?  And then, if so, why, or—and what’s your thoughts on that?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We have—we’ve said that we wouldn’t look at raising the target rate for inflation.  We did say that.  And the reason is, it’s become a global norm, 2 percent.  Our statutory mandate is price stability.  And so we’re actually taking a less—we’re looking at less radical ideas, such as how to make the 2 percent inflation objective more credible. This gives me a chance to say a couple things about the review and Chicago, in particular.  So it’s a new thing for us.  It’s something that—I thought it was both appropriate and important for us to do.  It’ll be a yearlong, or even longer, process, looking at our strategy, tools, and communications.  And it’s meant to be a way to open ourselves up, to let the sunshine in, and have dialogue and criticism with the constituencies that we serve.  We’ve had a series of Fed Listens around the country at every Reserve Bank, and we had an academic conference earlier this month, with seven papers written and criticized, and leading global experts. But I’ll just say, again, that the heart of the conference was the two panels on—with practitioners in low and moderate income—who live in low- and moderate-income communities and are part of those communities.  And they were—there, I think, people were quite struck by their intervention, which was really uniformly around how important maximum employment is  June 19, 2019  and what it means in their communities.  You know, the idea being, they haven’t had, you know,    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL  a bull market in these communities.  They haven’t had, just, a booming economy.  What they have had is low unemployment, lots of social problems.  And just now, you have, you know, companies who want to hire and are bringing people into the—providing opportunities for people to come into the labor force to an extent not seen in quite a long time. And that is, I think, you know, for someone who does this work, that was very focusing and motivating, too.  So I think everybody thought, you know, that’s—that was really quite worth doing.  I mean, there was some thought at the beginning that we should—some people recommended that we just talk to, you know, econ Ph.D.’s about this, but, no, that’s not what we chose to do, and we’re glad this is the choice we made. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  But even those two panels that you just referenced, the people that spoke, they—when they were asked about, you know, 2 percent inflation or higher inflation, they kind of shrugged their shoulders, you know?  So—is 4 percent inflation radical?  And to who? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I don’t think it’s—I don’t think it’s a practical alternative.  And I’ll tell you why.  I think you see disinflationary pressures around the world.  You see central banks having a hard time getting inflation up to their—close to their objective.  We’ve done better than other large central banks that are not, you know, open economies, like the U.K., where you have big currency moves that move inflation around.  So—but it’s quite challenging to get inflation—it’s been—even with very high levels of resource utilization, inflation has been lingering and not getting back up to target in a sustained, symmetric kind of a way.  So saying that you’re going to go for 4 percent—I wonder how credible that will be. 

[SECTION]

JOHN HELTMAN.  John Heltman with American Banker.  I have a question about the Fed’s—or, I guess, the bank regulators’ leveraged lending guidance from 2013.  As you know,  June 19, 2019  the GAO had a letter saying that they thought it was a rule, and it sort of went away.  But yet    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL leveraged lending is a source of concern.  You yourself have said that credit underwriting quality seems to be deteriorating somewhat lately, and that the Fed has tools to supervise banks and to prevent leveraged lending from becoming too much of an issue.  I want to know what the—is the 2013 guidance still representative of the, sort of, Fed’s thinking about leveraged lending?  And does the Fed have any intent—intention to either issue, like, a leveraged lending rule or a new guidance that is less problematic?  Or is the plan to just kind of carry on with supervision as you’re—as you are? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So the 2013 guidance is not binding, and that’s what came out of the GAO review.  But that’s really the beginning of this—of the story.  You know, we have the authority we need to examine the banks for safety and soundness exposure.  So, this—the first thing you start with as a bank supervisor is the risks that the banks are taking to themselves through their portfolio, through the risks that they’re running and the pipeline—you know, the obligations that they’ve undertaken to underwrite deals.  And so we monitor that very carefully—so do the banks—and you see exposures that are much smaller than they were before the crisis.  And, by the way, we test that regularly in the stress tests.  We impose very large losses on those portfolios, so we kind of have a sense of what that is, whereas before the crisis, there was a lot of lack of knowledge about what the losses would be.  So that’s where it starts for us in supervision, is the risks that the banks are running—you know, running on their own books and to themselves and to each other.  So, in that, I feel—I feel like that is—that’s in a good place, but we never—we never say “Mission accomplished” on that.  We will keep—you know, keep monitoring that carefully.  June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL What’s happened, though, is, the paper is now owned by market-based vehicles:  collateralized loan obligations, mutual funds, and things like that.  And so we now have—you know, we have a good sense of, domestically, of where that paper is.  I think, internationally, not as much, and the Financial Stability Board is actually looking more carefully at that.  And we—you know, we monitor those vehicles to see what they are.  And they’re actually pretty stably funded, in the sense that there’s no run risk, but there’s still macroeconomic risk.  And, you know, this is something that we take very seriously and that the FSOC, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, is looking at.  And, you know, we call it out as a macroeconomic risk, but it’s not really a financial stability risk, in the sense that it could undermine the ability of the financial system to do its job of intermediating credit. 

[SECTION]

JOHN HELTMAN.  Is there any intention, is there any plan on the part of the Fed or other regulators to sort of create any additional clarity for, or—and consistency, really—that’s the other point of guidance, right?—is to make sure everyone knows kind of what the supervisory expectations are for leveraged lending and for all—for anything, for that matter.  Is anything else coming?  Or is it just going to remain kind of, like, bilateral kind of conversations with banks? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. You know, I think the issue isn’t that the banks don’t understand what the rules are.  The issue is that the risk isn’t in the banks.  It’s in—it’s out in those market-based vehicles.  So I don’t, I don’t—you know, I no longer am day-to-day involved in this as I was before I took this job.  But my sense is, though, that that’s really not the problem.  I’m not saying it’s perfect, but I think we do understand what risks the banks are running.  And really the question is, how concerned should we be about large holdings by market-based vehicles that I mentioned, and what risks do they present?  And we’re very carefully assessing that.  And we  June 19, 2019  continue to take all these risks seriously.  You know, I gave a whole speech about this a few    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL weeks ago, so. 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi.  Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  I’m just wondering if you could expand a little bit on the labor market.  So the statement noted that the labor market still remains strong, but the May jobs report that that we saw missed on estimates, but employment rates still stayed at 3.6 percent.  I’m wondering how you reconcile that with the fact that we only got 3.1 percent year-over-year wage growth in that report.  What does that tell you about employment, and by all standards compared to, say, a month ago or a year ago, are we closer or farther away from full employment or maximum employment? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we have to be closer, because more jobs are being created than people are entering the labor force.  The unemployment rate is lower.  You know, by just lots and lots of numbers, the labor market is in a good place.  You mentioned wages.  So the level of wages is very consistent with what it should be, in the sense that it’s approximately equal to inflation plus productivity increases on an hourly basis.  So what’s, I guess, a little surprising, though, is that you could reach these levels of unemployment late—you know, long into a cycle, let’s say, and not see even higher wages that are pushing up on inflation, because wages at this level, even though they’re growing at a healthy rate, at an appropriate rate, they’re not growing at a rate that would provide much upward thrust for inflation. So, you know, we watch—we watch all of this very carefully, and I think we’re very careful about not assuming that we’re, you know, that would—that there’s no more slack in the labor market.  You know, we’ve all lived through—you know, when I got to the Fed, we were in the 8 percent–plus range, and it’s just gone down and down and down, and you haven’t seen wages picked up.  You haven’t seen real signals that we’re at maximum employment.  You have  June 19, 2019  seen a tightening labor market.  You know, it—the surveys that I mentioned will all show that    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL the labor market has tightened, but not overtightened. 

[SECTION]

JEAN YUNG.  Hi, Jean Yung with Market News.  I wanted to ask—did the FOMC discuss a change to its balance sheet policy at this meeting, perhaps ending runoffs earlier than planned?  And would the Committee be inclined to do something like that if it lowers rates before September? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, of course, we haven’t made any decisions yet.  Balance sheet runoff is very close to the end of its planned life.  I would say this:  If we do provide more accommodation—again, we haven’t really addressed this—but if we do provide more accommodation, we’ll certainly keep in mind what we said earlier this year, which is that we’ll always be willing to adjust balance sheet policy so that it serves our dual-mandate objectives.  Thank you very much.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
28,2019-07-31,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon, and welcome.  We decided today to lower the target for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point to a range of 2 percent to 2¼ percent.  The outlook for the U.S. economy remains favorable, and this action is designed to support that outlook.  It is intended to insure against downside risks from weak global growth and trade policy uncertainty, to help offset the effects these factors are currently having on the economy, and to promote a faster return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective.  All of these objectives will support achievement of our overarching goal:  to sustain the expansion, with a strong job market and inflation close to our objective, for the benefit of the American people.  We also decided to conclude the runoff of our securities portfolio in August rather than in reduction and then turn to the path forward. As the year began, both the economy and monetary policy were in a good place.  The unemployment rate was below 4 percent, and inflation had been running near our 2 percent objective for nine months.  Our interest rate target was at the low end of estimates of neutral.  Over the first half of the year, the economy grew at a healthy pace and job gains pushed unemployment to near a half-century low.  Wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs.  People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives.  This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job  July 31, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL Through the course of the year, weak global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation have prompted the FOMC to adjust its assessment of the appropriate path of interest rates.  The Committee moved from expecting rate increases this year to a patient stance about any changes and then to today’s action.  The median Committee participant’s assessments of the neutral rate of interest and the longer-run normal rate of unemployment have also declined this year, reinforcing the case for a somewhat lower path for our policy rate.  These changes in the anticipated path of interest rates have eased financial conditions and have supported the economy. At our June meeting, many Committee participants saw that the case for lowering the federal funds rate had strengthened, but the Committee wanted to get a better sense of the overall direction of events.  Since then, we have seen both positive and negative developments.  Job growth was strong in June and, looking through month-to-month fluctuations, the data point to continued strength.  We expect job growth to be slower than last year but above what we believe is required to hold the unemployment rate steady. GDP growth in the second quarter came in close to expectations.  Consumption—supported by rising incomes and high household confidence—is the main engine driving the economy forward.  But manufacturing output has declined for two consecutive quarters, and business fixed investment fell in the second quarter.  Foreign growth has disappointed, particularly in manufacturing and notably in the euro area and China.  In response to this weakness, many central banks around the world are increasing policy accommodation or contemplating doing so.  After simmering early in the year, trade policy tensions nearly boiled over in May and June but now appear to have returned to a simmer.  Looking through this  July 31, 2019  variability, our business contacts tell us that the ongoing uncertainty is making some companies   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   more cautious about their capital spending. The domestic inflation shortfall has continued.  Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices and is a better gauge of future developments than is total inflation, has run at 1.6 percent over the past 12 months.  We continue to expect that inflation will return over time to 2 percent.  But domestic inflation pressures remain muted, and global disinflationary pressures persist.  Wages are rising, but not at a pace that would put much upward pressure on inflation.  We are mindful that inflation’s return to 2 percent may be further delayed, and that continued below-target inflation could lead to a worrisome and difficult-to-reverse downward slide in longer-term expectations. So taking all of that on board, the Committee still sees a favorable baseline outlook.  Over the year, however, incoming information on global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation have led the Committee to gradually lower its assessments of the path of policy interest rate that would best support that outlook.  Today, we judge that those factors warrant the policy adjustment I described:  “As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.” Thank you.  I am happy to take your questions. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.  Per your statement here, I guess the question is, is there any reason to believe that a 25 basis point cut is going to be sufficient to expediently return inflation to your 2 percent target?  And, if not,  July 31, 2019  what are you going to be looking at to convince you that you need to cut rates again?  What is   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL the hurdle rate there? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I think you have to look at not just the 25 basis point cut, but look at the Committee’s actions over the course of the year.  As I noted in my opening statement, we started off expecting some rate increases, we moved to a patient setting for a few months, and now we’ve moved here.  I think what you’ve seen over the course of the year is, as we’ve moved to a more accommodative policy, the economy has actually performed just about as expected with that gradually increasing support.  And I think—I wouldn’t take credit for all of that, but I do think that increasing policy support has kept the economy on track and kept the outlook favorable. In terms of the rest of your question, the Committee is really thinking of this as a way of adjusting policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance to further the three objectives that I mentioned:  to insure against downside risks, to provide support to the economy, that those factors are—where factors are pushing down on economic growth, and then to support inflation.  So we do think it will serve all of those goals, but again, we’re thinking of it as essentially in the nature of a midcycle adjustment to policy. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  There’s a perception out there that perhaps, in this case, the Fed is something of a hammer in search of a nail, because the latest consumer spending reports, as you suggested, don’t seem to show any kind of demand problem in the U.S.  And when you look at mortgage rates, auto lending rates, they’ve all come down.  And so, wondering exactly what problem lower capital costs will solve. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, you’re absolutely right.  The—the performance of the economy has been reasonably good.  The position of the economy is as close to our objectives as it’s been  July 31, 2019  in a long time, and the outlook is also good.  What we’ve been monitoring since the beginning of   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   the year is, effectively, downside risks to that outlook from weakening global growth, and we see that everywhere:  weak manufacturing, weak global growth now, particularly in the European Union and China.  In addition, we see trade policy developments, which at times have been disruptive and then have been less so, and also inflation running below target.  So we see those as threats to what is clearly a favorable outlook, and we see this action as designed to support them and keep that outlook favorable.  And, frankly, it is a continuation of what we’ve been doing all year to provide more support against those very same risks. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  But the follow-up question is, how does it do that?  How does cutting interest rates lower—or, how does cutting interest rates keep that going, since the cost of capital doesn’t seem to be the issue here? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I—I really think it does, and I think the evidence of my eyes tells me that our policy does support—it supports confidence, it supports economic activity, household and business confidence, and through channels that we understand.  So it will lower borrowing costs.  It will—and it will work.  And I think you see it.  Since—you know, since we noted our vigilance about the situation in June, you saw financial conditions move up, and you saw—I won’t take credit for the whole recovery, but you saw financial conditions move up.  You see confidence, which had troughed in June—you saw it move back up.  You see economic activity on a healthy basis.  It just—it seems to work through confidence channels as well as the mechanical channels that you are talking about. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post.  You always say that the Fed is data dependent, and much of the data that we’ve seen since the June meeting has surprised to the upside or at least been in line with expectations.  Can you give us a sense of how  July 31, 2019  that better-than-expected data impacted the FOMC’s thinking?  And if we keep seeing these   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL upside surprises, does that change or evolve any FOMC thinking going forward? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, yes.  I mean, I think we—of course, you know, what we do at every meeting, as I noted, is, we do a deep dive into U.S. economic activity and global activity and, certainly, carefully went through U.S. economic activity, which there has been some positive and some negative, but, overall, the U.S. economy has shown resilience during the intermeeting period.  But, again, the—the issue is more the downside risks and then the shortfall in inflation, and we’re trying to address those. So, in addition, going forward, I would say, we’re going to be monitoring those same things.  We’ll be monitoring the evolution of trade uncertainty, of global growth, and of low inflation.  And we’ll also, of course, be watching the performance of the U.S. economy.  As I mentioned, it had shown some resilience here to those issues, and we’ll be putting all of that together, and that’s how we’ll be thinking about policy going forward. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  I just want to follow up on that.  Would you say we’re sort of—you guys have gotten into a new regime here?  This is sort of an insurance cut and not a data-dependent cut?  And are we now more in the realm of watching headlines of trade talks than we are watching unemployment rate and inflation numbers, or—and growth numbers?  What—how do we know what you’re going to do next, and why now in this new regime? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So I gave three reasons for what we did, and that is to insure against downside risks to the outlook from weak global growth and trade tensions.  So that is—in a sense, that is a risk-management point, and that is a bit of insurance.  But we also feel like weak global growth and trade tensions are having an effect on the U.S. economy.  You see it  July 31, 2019  now in the second quarter:  You see weak investment, you see weak manufacturing—so support   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   demand there and also to support return of inflation to 2 percent.  But there’s definitely an insurance aspect of it. Trade is unusual.  We don’t—you know, the thing is, there isn’t a lot of experience in responding to global trade tensions.  So it is a—it’s something that we haven’t faced before and that we’re learning by doing.  And it is not—it’s not exactly the same as watching global growth, where you see growth weakening, you see central banks and governments responding with fiscal policy, and you see growth strengthening, and you see a business cycle.  With trade tensions—which do seem to be having a significant effect on financial market conditions and on the economy—they evolve in a different way, and we have to follow them. And, by the way, I want to be clear here.  We play no role whatsoever in assessing or evaluating trade policies other than as—as trade policy uncertainty has an effect on the U.S. economy in the short and medium term.  We’re not in any way criticizing trade policy.  That’s really not our job. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  So, Chair Powell, you and your colleagues have offered three reasons to cut rates:  a lower neutral rate that risk picture from the trade tensions, and this desire to re-center inflation and inflation expectations.  I wonder, which of those factors, if any, weighs most heavily on you?  And, more importantly, is a ¼ point cut really going to address all of that, let alone any one of those? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I actually think different people have different—different weightings has been my experience on those things.  You mentioned lower r*, trade slowdown—and I would actually add, lower natural rate of unemployment too has moved down, all of which  July 31, 2019  kind of point to more accommodation.  So, again, I don’t think asking about a ¼ point is really   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL the right question.  I think you have to look back over the course of the year and see the Committee moving away from rate increases to a neutral posture to, now, a rate cut. So I think we’ve been providing—and that affects the forward rate path, and it affects financial conditions, and financial conditions affect the economy.  You see an economy which is actually performing pretty well.  Growth in the first half of this year is about the same as it was in all of ’18 and actually a little better than our forecast for growth in 2019—at the end of 2019.  So I think, in a way, that’s monetary policy working.  And, again, I wouldn’t just look at the 25 basis point cut as the right question. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  If I could follow up, I guess in May—in May it seemed as if you were setting a higher bar to cut rates:  There would need to be a deterioration in the outlook.  In is that bar right now, because I think there’s some confusion about how the Committee is responding. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So we, as we noted—we noted at the bottom of the statement that language, which really says how we’re thinking about it.  So it says, as we’re contemplating the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, we’ll continue to monitor the implications of incoming information—and it talks about that language.  So, you know, I can’t—all I can tell you is, we’ll be looking at weak global growth.  We’ll be looking very carefully to see how that’s happening. And I think you see—you learn—every cycle you learn about these things.  So we will see whether growth is picking up, whether it’s bottoming out.  We’ll see that picture.  We’ll also see on trade.  You know, we’re going to be seeing—I think we’ve learned a lot on trade in this  July 31, 2019  cycle.  I think we’ll continue to learn more, and on inflation we will.  So, in addition, the U.S.   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL economy itself is—the performance of the U.S. economy will enter into that.  So I would love to be more precise, but with trade, it is a factor that we have to assess in kind of a new way.  Those are the things that we’ll be looking at, and—you know, in making our decisions going forward. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence with Fox Business Network.  So a rate hike last December was seen by some economists and the St. Louis Fed president, James Bullard, as a step too far.  Now the Fed’s waited about seven months for a rate cut.  You said today you were concerned about downside risks.  So could some of the weakness on the business side, with that fixed investment and the sluggish side on the business side, be because the Fed waited so long?  I want to get your thoughts on that and talk about why you feel that this nudge is the right level. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So we don’t hear that from businesses.  They don’t come in and say, “We’re not investing because, you know, the federal funds rate is too high.”  I haven’t heard that from a business.  What you hear is that demand is weak for their products.  You see manufacturing being weak all over the world.  Investment—business investment is weak.  And I wouldn’t lay all of that at the door of trade talks.  I think there’s a—there’s a global business cycle happening with manufacturing and investment, and that’s—that’s been, you know, definitely a bigger factor than, certainly, we expected late last year.  I think global—global growth started to slow down in the middle of last year, but that has gone on to a greater extent.  And, by the way, trade policy uncertainty has also been, I think, more elevated than we anticipated. In terms of, is this the—we believe this is the right move for today, and we think it’s—we think it will serve the three ends that I mentioned.  And I’ve already gone over how we’re thinking about going forward.  July 31, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

ANN SAPHIR.  Ann Saphir with Reuters.  You called it “a midcycle adjustment to policy.”  And, I mean, what should we take this to mean, and what message do you mean to send with this move today about future rate moves? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, the sense of that is—I mean, that refers back to other times when the FOMC has cut rates in the middle of a cycle.  And I’m contrasting it there with the beginning—for example, the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle. 

[SECTION]

ANN SAPHIR.  So we’re not at the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  That is not—that’s not what we’re seeing now.  That’s not our perspective now or outlook. 

[SECTION]

JAMES POLITI.  Hi there.  Are there any circumstances under which you would decide to pause—pause at one interest rate cut, today’s interest rate cut, and not—not, not go ahead with further monetary easing at this stage?  Or are you predicting that, you know, once you’ve embarked on this easing, you will have to at least move by one more notch going forward? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so our policy is—will depend on the implications of incoming data for the economic outlook as well as evolving risks to that outlook.  And so we’re going to be monitoring the implications of incoming information for the outlook, as I mentioned.  And, so I—that’s really where I would leave you with that. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  On capital, Vice Chairman Quarles has said that the level of capital requirements that exists right now are such that it’s basically like the countercyclical capital buffer is already turned on, and that he would like the ability to be able to turn it down in a downturn.  I was wondering if you agreed with that.  July 31, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL And then, also, just quickly, on real-time payments—larger banks have suggested that if the Fed built its own system, that would be a bait-and-switch, because the Fed asked—or called for a private-sector system.  Do you think that that is a fair assessment?

CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  So, on the first, I would say that I view the level of capital requirements and the level of capital in the system as being about right.  I do agree with that.  The idea that you’re talking about is one that’s—that Vice Chair Quarles has talked about.  It’s a—it’s one under consideration.  The idea being, in a sense, we’ve chosen, in the United States, to have high through-the-cycle capital requirements by doubling the SIFI surcharge, which is the surcharge that the largest banks have in their capital requirements.  We’ve, in effect, already put in place substantial countercyclical buffers.  And so, conceptually, you can think of—I’m not saying it’s the same thing as a countercyclical capital buffer. So that’s—that’s really the point—is that we don’t rely—our system doesn’t rely on our ability—it doesn’t mainly rely on our ability to identify the right time in the cycle to trigger a countercyclical tool.  We rely on through-the-cycle, always-on high capital and liquidity requirements.  And I think that’s a good thing to do.  The idea of putting it in place so you can cut it, that’s something some other jurisdictions have done, and it’s worth considering.  I think the United Kingdom, in particular, has a countercyclical capital buffer that’s always on, but the one point of it is that you can cut when there’s a downturn and therefore give the banks more room.  So this isn’t something we’ve decided to do.  It’s just under consideration. In terms of the real-time payment system, your second question, so this is something we—the United States is far behind other countries in terms of having real-time payments available to the general public.  The Fed, really, coming out of the Reserve System—the Reserve Banks and the Board together—convened all of the stakeholders around the table to talk about  July 31, 2019  how we can move forward.  This is consumer groups, technology companies, banks, card   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL companies—pretty much all of the groups who would be interested—and worked on a project for several years.  And one of the things that came out of that was a recommendation that the Fed should build a 24 x 7 x 365 real-time settlement system to solve that problem—to address that We put out a proposal in October of last year about, you know, should we do this, and we got quite a lot of comments.  They were overwhelmingly favorable.  And I would point out that in our payment system, in many places, the Fed operates alongside private-sector operators—for example, in wholesale payments, in ACH, and in check—so it wouldn’t be unusual or out of keeping with—with how we’ve done things in the past.  We have not made a decision on this, but it’s something we’re looking at carefully and something I do expect we’ll make a decision 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Craig Torres from Bloomberg.  I’m trying to parse what you’re saying here.  On the one hand, you say the policy tilt in the statement has eased financial conditions, and that’s helping the economy.  In that tilt, market participants are interpreting this language, “will act as appropriate,” as still being in the statement.  And, on the other hand, you say it’s not the start of a—of an easing cycle.  So what are you saying?  Does that mean, you know, with one or two more cuts you’ll be done, and this policy bias comes out of the statement?  Or simply that this policy bias will come out of the statement sooner than market participants 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So it is—as I mentioned, it’s going to depend on the evolving data and the evolving risk picture.  But as we look at the situation now and the outlook now, what we see is that it’s appropriate to make an adjustment in policy to a somewhat more accommodative problem. on soon. think?  July 31, 2019  stance.  That’s what we’re seeing.  And that’s what we’re going to be looking—you know, we’ll   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   be looking at incoming data, at all of the—at the risks that I mentioned, and the performance of the U.S. economy, and at low inflation.  We’ll be looking at that to make our decisions going 

[SECTION]

SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Scott Horsley for NPR.  You’ve talked a number of times about the people who feel like they are just recently getting to the punchbowl 10 years into this expansion.  Can you elaborate a little bit on how this rate cut is expected to forward. help them? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think the best thing for people who are—who are feeling that—and we are getting lots of feedback from people who work and live in low- and moderate-income communities to the effect that they’re now feeling the recovery, and, in fact, they haven’t felt a better labor market in anybody’s memory, so this is great to hear.  And I guess my view is, the best thing we can do for those people is to sustain the expansion, keep it going, and that’s one of the overarching goals of—of this move and all of our policy moves.  There really is no reason why the expansion can’t keep going.  Inflation is not troublingly high.  If you look at the—at the U.S. economy right now, there’s no sector that’s booming and therefore might bust.  You have a fairly well-balanced, in a sense, economy. Now, the engine, though, is really a consumer economy, which is 70 percent of the economy.  The manufacturing economy—the investment and manufacturing part of the economy—is more or less not—not growing much.  It’s at a healthy level but not growing much.  So—and we hope to help that with this rate cut.  But, I would say, overall, we’re trying to sustain the expansion and keep, you know, close to our statutory goals, which are maximum employment and stable prices.  July 31, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN.  The President has repeatedly called for this rate hike and for the Fed to end the runoff of its balance sheet.  What do you say to those that say that the Fed gave into what the President wanted today?  And could you also elaborate a little bit further on why the Fed decided to speed up its balance sheet runoff two months earlier today? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I gave my—my reasons for—our reasons, really—for doing this.  And, you know, just to touch on that again, this action is designed to insure against downside risks to the outlook from weak global growth and trade tensions, offset the negative effect that those factors are already having, and promote a faster return of inflation to 2 percent.  That’s what we’ve been talking about all year long, and we’ve gradually moved our policy in the direction of more accommodation.  I think what you see is an economy that has reacted well to that.  So that’s what we’re doing, and that’s why we’re doing it. We never take into account political considerations.  There’s no place in our discussions for that.  We also don’t conduct monetary policy in order to prove our independence.  We conduct monetary policy in order to—to move as close as possible to our statutory goals, and that’s what we’re always going to do.  We’re always going to use our tools that way.  And then, at the end, we’ll—you know, we’ll live with the results. In terms of the balance sheet, that was really just a matter of simplicity and consistency.  Really nothing more to it than that. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Chairman Powell.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  I was wondering—we weren’t in the room, but I think it’s a fair assumption to know that the two dissenters probably spoke about financial stability concerns.  So I was wondering if you could talk about what you—what was your response to them when those concerns were raised?  I’ve  July 31, 2019  collected a couple of things from the IMF, and the Bank of International Settlements said that it’s   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   just—when you have low rates, you just get more debt in the economy, and that there’s also this feeling that it makes it harder to raise rates.  So could you talk about that?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So, first, let me say—I’ll just speak for myself, but I understand those concerns very well.  I do.  I’ve—you know, I’ve studied them, I’ve spoken about them, and I take them very seriously.  But as I look at today’s situation, I don’t see them as a reason not to take this action today.  I just don’t think—that would be my point.  And one of the reasons why I think that is, if you look—if you look—so we have a financial stability framework now for the first time.  Before the crisis, we didn’t have this, but now we have it, and we publish it.  And we look at, really, four big things so that we know we can—you know, the public can hold us accountable and compare us meeting to meeting, and—you know, and see whether we got this right, because it’s transparent now. But the four things we look at are valuation pressures.  And we do see notable valuation pressures in some markets but, you know, honestly, not at a highly troubling level.  In terms of household borrowing, household and business borrowing is the second thing.  Households are in a very good shape overall.  I’ll come back to business borrowing.  Leverage in the financial system is low, and funding risk is low.  So, overall, staff’s view has been—and my view has been—that if you look overall, financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate. The place that gets all the attention right now—a lot of attention—is business borrowing, and we look very carefully at that.  What’s happening with business borrowing is, the loans have moved off the balance sheets of the banks and into market-based vehicles, which tend to be stably funded.  But, nonetheless, it’s clear that the highly leveraged business sector could act as an amplifier to a downturn.  So we’re watching that very carefully.  But, again, I think if you  July 31, 2019  look overall at the U.S. financial system, what you see is a high level of resilience—much higher   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   than it was before the crisis—and that’s something to take comfort from.  And I think all of that gives us the ability to use monetary policy for its purposes and rely on supervisory and regulatory tools to—you know, to keep the financial system resilient. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  So you’re not doing something today for—to help today, and then it’s going to cause problems down the road?  You’re not worried about that kind of dynamic? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  There are very few things that I don’t worry about at all.  So, of course, of course, we monitor.  We have—every quarter we have an extensive briefing on financial stability, and we had that yesterday.  So we look at this on an ongoing basis.  We have a great team.  We liaise with central banks around the world.  You know, one of my colleagues is the head of the Financial Stability Board globally, so we’re very, very much monitoring these things all the time.  And we worry about them all the time.  We’re always looking at the—we’re looking for that thing that we may have missed a lot of the time.  But the things we haven’t missed, I think they paint a mixed picture, but not one that should prevent us from taking monetary policy actions that we think are appropriate to support the economy. conference about being data dependent going forward, and that this is not the start of a series of rate cuts.  But the financial markets seem to think that this is the start of a series of rate cuts, and they’re predicting three, four cuts this year.  Is this your effort to try to damp down that—that 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  No.  Let me be clear.  What I said was, it’s not—it’s not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts.  I didn’t—I didn’t say it’s just one or anything like that.  What I said is, when you think about rate-cutting cycles, they go on for a long time, and the thing?  July 31, 2019  Committee is not seeing that—not seeing us in that place.  You would do that if you saw real   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL economic weakness and you thought that the federal funds rate needed to be cut a lot.  That’s not what we’re seeing.  That’s not what we’re seeing. What we’re seeing is that it’s appropriate to—to adjust policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance over time, and that’s how we’re looking at it.  What I said was, it’s not a long cutting cycle—in other words, referring to what we do when there’s a recession or a very severe downturn.  That’s—that’s really what I was ruling out.  I think, if you look back at other midcycle adjustments, you’ll see—you know, I don’t know that they’ll be, in the end, comparable or not, but you’ll see examples of these. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times.  You mentioned the difficulty of assessing trade tensions in the economic outlook.  Could you say how much of a factor the U.S.–China trade conflict was in the Fed’s decision to cut rates?  And if the current stalemate and the threat of more tariffs continue, what would that mean for future interest rates and possible cuts? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, I wouldn’t bring it down to any one trade thing or any one factor.  I think we look at a broad range of factors, and trade uncertainty—trade policy uncertainty is one of them.  That certainly includes the discussions with China, but I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t be able to tell you how much of it is due to that.  And without knowing—you know, I think we—with trade, we have to react to the developments, and we don’t know what they’ll be, and so it’s hard to exactly say.  Certainly, we’ve seen, though, that when there’s a sharp confrontation between two large economies, you can see effects on business confidence pretty quickly and on financial markets pretty quickly.  We saw that in June.  But then we saw them unwind after that, to some extent.  You’ve seen it returning to—to a much lower temperature, I  July 31, 2019  think.  Again, with—with trade policy, we’re just going to be watching and trying to assess the   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL implications for the—for the U.S. outlook. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  How much of an effect could the tariffs have? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, the mechanical effects of the tariffs are quite small.  They’re not large as it relates to the U.S. economy.  The real question is, what are the effects on the economy through the—through the confidence channel—business confidence channel?  And, again, very, very hard to tease that out.  I’ve seen some research, which—you know, which says that they are meaningful—meaningful effects on—on output.  That’s to say, not trivial.  And I think that that sounds right, but it’s quite hard to get—there is no way to get an accurate measure.  You have to look at a range of estimates, and I think businesses will tell you that it’s a factor, particularly businesses that have—manufacturing businesses that have supply chains that cross international borders will all tell you that it’s been a challenge.  Many of them have made adjustments, and they’ve gotten to a place where it’s okay, but it’s—it’s been a challenge. 

[SECTION]

PAUL KIERNAN.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.  Thanks for the question, Chairman.  As the press conference—as this press conference has gone under way, markets have more guidance around the future path of rates.  And I’m wondering if that reflects a greater lack of consensus on the Committee.  And, you know, how much consensus do you want to see around these decisions, and how split are people about this? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, you’re right.  There’s a range of views on the Committee, and—but the Committee is unified, completely unified on our dedication to making the best policy decisions that we can make.  And that means people have a responsibility to do their best thinking and to present that thinking, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.  July 31, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL In terms of the way forward, we will be monitoring the factors that I mentioned, and we laid that out in the—you know, in the postmeeting statement, and that’s the roadmap we’re going to be following going forward.  We’re going to be data dependent.  We’re going to be, as we always are, doing what we need to do—what we believe we need to do to support the economic expansion. 

[SECTION]

JOHN HELTMAN.  Hi, John Heltman with American Banker.  So it’s been about 18 months since the Fed issued its enforcement action against Wells Fargo.  And I was wondering if you could characterize the progress that the bank has made towards the shortcomings that it had in its risk-management processes.  And I’m also curious whether their lack of a permanent CEO has hampered progress, in your eyes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So the problems at Wells Fargo—that arose at Wells Fargo around risk management and consumer—the way they dealt with the consumer were actually pretty deep, and I think the company realizes that.  And they’re not going to be fixed—they haven’t been fixed quickly, and, frankly, we didn’t expect them to be fixed quickly.  So they’re—you know, they—they will be under the growth cap, our enforcement action, until the Board votes to lift it, and that’s not something we’re considering doing right now.  And the Committee—I mean, the company is working away to address these issues, but, as I said, they’re deep-seated issues, and it just takes time to address them. I wouldn’t comment on the CEO question.  I don’t really have anything for you on that. 

[SECTION]

JOHN HELTMAN.  I mean, I just—I’d like to clarify, like, are you pleased with the responsiveness you’re getting from them?  Do you feel like this is going the way that you kind of wanted it to go?  July 31, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I’m not going to characterize it.  You know—I mean, I have characterized it.  We have—we have an enforcement action in place.  The company is working away at addressing it.  They take it seriously.  I think they do see it as we do, as something that has to go deep.  And, you know, we’ll lift the growth cap when we’re satisfied. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  So when we have our next recession, the Fed will have less room—it will happen—the Fed will have less room to maneuver cutting interest rates since you’re cutting now.  How big of a problem will that be? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, the premise is not—I will question your premise for a second.  If you remember whether—again, one of the purposes of our—of our cut today is to support the expansion.  And we don’t know when—and if it really works—if that works very well and the economy gets going again, you know, you don’t know where the—where the funds, in other cycles—and I don’t know whether this will happen or not, but in other cycles, the Fed wound up raising rates again after a midcycle adjustment.  Again, I’m not predicting that, but I don’t think that we know that we won’t have—that we’ll have less ammo because of these things.  That’s one thing.  So— 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  But you won’t be able to cut as much if—if rates are low.  I mean, you will have—have less ammo, in that sense. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, but you’re assuming that we would never raise rates again, that once we’ve cut these rates that they can never go back up again.  Just as a matter of principle, I don’t think that’s right.  In other—in other long, long cycles, long U.S. business cycles have sometimes involved this kind of event where the Fed will stop hiking—in fact, will cut—and then will go back to hiking.  Again, I don’t know whether that’ll happen right here.  It doesn’t  July 31, 2019  seem—it doesn’t seem like something that’s in—you know, particularly likely, frankly, but we   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL don’t know that. comes. And the other thing is, I think by extending the cycle, you—you do have a lot of benefits from that.  And I think, you know, we will use the tools that we have.  A couple of rate hikes one way or the other isn’t going to matter so much if there is a downturn.  And you’re right, there will eventually be one.  We’ll use all of our tools aggressively, as we need to, when that time 

[SECTION]

JEAN YUNG.  Hi, Jean Yung with MNI.  Can you give us an update on the ongoing reassessment of the inflation framework?  And have the discussions so far this year had any bearing on today’s decision? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So the monetary policy review is really for—it’s really there to look at the way we make policy in the longer run.  It’s not something that enters directly into our discussions today.  We’ve had—so far we’ve had a series of meetings, called Fed Listens, at almost all the Reserve Banks.  Soon it will be all the Reserve Banks.  And we meet there with the constituencies that we serve, and they’ve been very, very successful, hearing from people—not just—not just economists, but people who are not economists, how—how their lives interact with the Fed’s work.  It’s been—it’s been great.  I’ve got to say, it’s been even better than I hoped it would be. We’re just now beginning the process of incorporating all of that feedback, and we’re going to be having a series of meetings, beginning today and yesterday, as we evaluate, you know, the questions that we’re asking about our framework.  So it’s very early to say where that’s going, but, you know, we’re setting the table now and looking at what our framework is  July 31, 2019  and looking at how it’s performed, looking at how all frameworks performed around the world   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL during the Global Financial Crisis.  I expect we’ll be at this a while. I’m very excited about it.  I think it’s been a good exercise.  I think it’s opened us up to sunlight and perspectives that we might not have gotten otherwise.  And I think it’s a good time.  You know, you have—10 years after the crisis, you’re really living in a new normal for the economy and monetary policy, and it’s a really good time to step back and ask whether there are some things that we can do to improve our framework. 

[SECTION]

COURTENAY BROWN.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Courtenay Brown from Axios.  Can you give us a sense of whether the Committee feels constrained at all by the market’s expectations for more cuts or other developments in financial markets? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I think this was—this was well telegraphed.  What we did today was—was very consistent with what we had said we were going to do.  I had mentioned the reasons for it.  They’ve been well telegraphed, and I think—you know, I think they will—they will achieve their goals. We do know that monetary policy works through communications and then actions that are consistent with those communications, and we think that the changes that we’ve made this year have really worked.  Of course, we always retain the flexibility to adjust our communications and our actions to—in light of incoming data and the evolving risk picture, but—I’ll leave it there. 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  Just to expand on that point about communication, I mean, we saw that markets have been particularly sensitive with regards to New York Fed President John Williams’s remarks before the blackout period.  So the Fed added language in the statement that says that the Committee is contemplating the future path of  July 31, 2019  the target range for the federal funds rate as it monitors implications.  I’m wondering—now   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL there’s kind of this inflection point about whether or not the downside risk, because you’ve had to cut rates, outweighs the fact that you still see a positive outlook of the U.S. economy at a baseline.  So, just wondering if you can kind of clarify all those things within the context of the challenges of communicating it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, so again, I see the U.S. outlook as being a positive one.  And we do—we have had these global, really, risks to the outlook.  There really—there really is nothing in the U.S. economy that presents a—you know, a prominent near-term threat to the U.S. economy.  As I mentioned, there’s no—there’s no segment that’s really—or sector that’s really boiling over and overheating.  Nothing like that.  It’s—it’s within—within the economy.  It’s—it’s healthy, so I would say that.  Downside risks are really coming from abroad.  And, of course, we are concerned about—about low inflation.  But—and, by the way, those risks from abroad are affecting the manufacturing sector here and business investment—fixed investment.  So—thank you.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
29,2019-09-18,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome.  My colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people.  We do this by steadfastly       pursuing the goals Congress has given us:  maximum employment and stable prices.  We are committed to making the best decisions we can based on facts and objective analysis.  Today we economy strong in the face of some notable developments and to provide insurance against ongoing risks. The U.S. economy has continued to perform well.  We are into the 11th year of this economic expansion, and the baseline outlook remains favorable.  The economy grew at a 2½ percent pace in the first half of the year.  Household spending—supported by a strong job contrast, business investment and exports have weakened amid falling manufacturing output.  The main reasons appear to be slower growth abroad and trade policy developments—two sources of uncertainty that we’ve been monitoring all year. Since the middle of last year, the global growth outlook has weakened, notably in Europe and China.  Additionally, a number of geopolitical risks, including Brexit, remain unresolved.  Trade policy tensions have waxed and waned, and elevated uncertainty is weighing on U.S. investment and exports.  Our business contacts around the country have been telling us that uncertainty about trade policy has discouraged them from investing in their businesses.  Business fixed investment posted a modest decline in the second quarter, and recent indicators point to continued softness.  Even so, with household spending remaining on a solid footing and with supportive financial conditions, we expect the economy to continue to expand at a moderate rate.    September 18, 2019  As seen from FOMC participants’ most recent projections, the median expectation for real GDP   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   growth remains near 2 percent this year and next before edging down toward its estimated longer-run value. The job market remains strong.  The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for a year and a half, and job gains have remained solid in recent months.  The pace of job gains has eased this year, but we had expected some slowing after last year’s strong pace.  Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years has been increasing.  And wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs.  People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives.  This underscores, for us, the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.  We expect the job market to remain strong.  The median of participants’ projections for the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent over the next several years. Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.  Over the 12 months through July, total PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was 1.6 percent.  We still expect inflation to rise to 2 percent; the median projection is 1.9 percent this year and 2 percent in 2021.1  However, inflation pressures clearly remain muted, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historical ranges.  We are mindful that continued below-target inflation could lead to an unwelcome downward slide in longer-term inflation expectations. Overall, as we say in our postmeeting statement, we continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent                                                  1 Chair Powell intended to say that the median projection is 1.9 percent next year.  September 18, 2019  objective as most likely.  While this has been our outlook for quite some time, our views about   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL the path of interest rates that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year.  As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade policy uncertainty have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks.  These factors, in conjunction with muted inflation pressures, have led us to shift our views about appropriate monetary policy over time toward a lower path for the federal funds rate, and this shift has supported the outlook.  Of course, this is the role of monetary policy—to adjust interest rates to maintain a strong labor Today’s decision to lower the federal funds rate target by ¼ percent, to 1.75 percent to 2 percent, is appropriate in light of the global developments I mentioned as well as muted inflation pressures.  Since our last meeting, we have seen additional signs of weakness abroad and a resurgence of trade policy tensions, including the imposition of additional tariffs.  The Fed has no role in the formulation of trade policy, but we do take into account anything that could materially affect the economy relative to our employment and inflation goals. The future course of monetary policy will depend on how the economy evolves and what developments imply for the economic outlook and risks to the outlook.  We have often said that policy is not on a preset course, and that is certainly the case today.  As I have noted, the baseline economic outlook remains positive.  The projections of appropriate policy show that participants generally anticipate only modest changes in the federal funds rate over the next couple of years.  Of course, those views are merely forecasts and, as always, will evolve with the arrival of new information. Let me say a few words about our monetary policy operations.  Funding pressures in money markets were elevated this week, and the effective federal funds rate rose above the top  September 18, 2019  of its target range yesterday.  While these issues are important for market functioning and market   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   participants, they have no implications for the economy or the stance of monetary policy.  This upward pressure emerged as funds flowed from the private sector to the Treasury to meet corporate tax payments and settle purchases of Treasury securities.  To counter these pressures, we conducted overnight repurchase operations yesterday and again today.  These temporary operations were effective in relieving funding pressures, and we expect the federal funds rate to move back into the target range.  In addition, as we have done in the past, we made a technical adjustment to the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances, setting it 20 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate.  In a related action, we also adjusted the rate on the overnight repurchase facility to 5 basis points below the bottom of the target range.  We will continue to monitor market developments and will conduct operations as necessary to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates within the target range.  Consistent with our decision earlier this year to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime, we will, over time, provide a sufficient supply of reserves so that frequent operations are not required.  To summarize, we are fully committed to pursuing our goals of maximum employment and stable prices.  As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective. Thanks.  I’ll be happy to take your questions.  September 18, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL when you cut rates in July, you characterized it as a “midcycle adjustment.”  Is that still your view of what’s happening? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, as you can see from our policy statement and from the SEP, we see a favorable economic outlook, with continued moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 percent objective.  And, by the way, that view is consistent with those of many other forecasters.  As you can see, FOMC participants generally think that these positive economic outcomes will be achieved with modest adjustments to the federal funds rate.  At the last press conference, I pointed to two episodes in, I guess, 1995 and 1998 as examples of such an approach, which was successful in both of those instances.  As our statement also highlights, though, there are risks to this positive outlook due particularly to weak global growth and trade developments.  And if the economy does turn down, then a more extensive sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate.  We don’t see that—it’s not what we expect—but we would certainly follow that path if it became appropriate.  In other words, as we say in our statement, we will continue to monitor these developments closely, and we will act as appropriate to help ensure that the expansion remains on track. 

[SECTION]

RICHARD MILLER.  [Inaudible remark]  I’m sorry.  Rich Miller with Bloomberg.  Taking the statement, your opening remarks, and the SEP,  I’m just wondering what kind of message we should take from this.  Do you still—does the FOMC—is it safe to say the FOMC still has an easing bias or not? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So the idea of having a bias is something that was a longtime practice, and we don’t actually have that practice anymore, so I can’t really adopt it right here.  But, nonetheless, I’ll respond to your question.  So we did—we made one decision today, and  September 18, 2019  that decision was to lower the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point.  We believe that action is   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   appropriate to promote our objectives, of course.  We’re going to be highly data dependent, as always.  Our decisions are going to depend on the implications of incoming information for the outlook, and I would also say, as we often do, that we’re not on a preset course.  So that’s how we’re going to look at it.  We’re going to be carefully looking at economic data.  Sometimes the path ahead is clear and sometimes less so.  So we’re going to be looking carefully, meeting by meeting, at the full range of information, and we’re going to assess the appropriate stance of policy as we go.  And, as I said, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion. 

[SECTION]

RICHARD MILLER.  If I could just follow up, you’ve also said that the favorable outlook is predicated on financial conditions, and the financial conditions are in turn predicated on an outlook for Fed policy—in this case, further cuts.  Wouldn’t that suggest that you should be inclined to—if you want those financial conditions and that favorable outlook to come about, you should be inclined to cut? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, what we do going forward is very much going to depend, Rich, on the flow of data and information.  We’ve seen—you know, if you look at the things we’re monitoring, particularly global growth and trade developments, global growth has continued to weaken.  I think it’s weakened since our last meeting.  Trade developments have been up and down and then up, I guess—or back up, perhaps—over the course of this intermeeting period.  In any case, they’ve been quite volatile.  So we do see those risks as actually more heightened now.  We’re going to be watching that carefully.  We’re also going to be watching the U.S. data quite carefully, and we’ll have to make an assessment as we go. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  I know you’re trying to speak for the Committee when you do these press conferences,  September 18, 2019  but the Committee is clearly divided right now, at least about the outlook and the appropriate   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL policy path.  Some people think you need to wait and see the labor market and the consumer crack or weaken further before acting more aggressively, and some people think that by the time that happens, you’ll need to do even more aggressive action to arrest a downturn.  Where do you stand on this? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, let me just say, on the general point of diverse perspectives, you’re right.  Sometimes the—and there have been many of those times in my now almost eight years at the Fed, many times when the direction is relatively clear and it’s relatively easy to reach unanimity.  This is a time of difficult judgments and, as you can see, disparate perspectives.  And I really do think that’s nothing but healthy, and so I see a benefit in having those diverse perspectives, really.  So your question, though, is? 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  This is to your own view, because the data is, to some extent, lagged, especially when you have these risks on the horizon, and the markets obviously think that these risks could materialize more than what you and your colleagues are projecting in the dot plot today.  So, I wonder, where are your own views about the tension between risk management, which implies some degree of data independence, and this idea of being data dependent? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So I’ll try to get at that this way.  I think that the idea that if you see trouble approaching on the horizon, you steer away from it if you can—I think that’s a good idea in principle, and I think history teaches us that it’s better to be proactive in adjusting policy if you can. I think applying that principle in a particular situation is where the challenge comes.  So I told you where the Committee—the bulk of the Committee is going, meeting by meeting, and I think the main takeaway is that this is a Committee that has shifted its policy stance repeatedly,  September 18, 2019  consistently, through the course of the year to support economic activity as it has felt that it’s   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL appropriate.  At the beginning of the year we were looking at further rate increases, then we were patient, and then we cut once, then we cut again.  And I think you’ve seen us being willing to move based on data, based on the evolving risk picture, and I have no reason to think that will change.  I think—but it will continue to be data dependent, and depend—data includes the evolving risk picture.  That’s where I am, and that’s where I think the bulk of the Committee is. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you’re—oh, sorry.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  I’ve only done this a dozen—a lot of times.  I wonder if you’re concerned about how the Federal Reserve operated through the recent liquidity crunch in markets.  We talked to many traders who said the tax date payment was known well in advance.  There were several reports of people pointing to September as a potential crunch time.  You closed Monday at the top end of the fed funds rate.  Tuesday came along, and there wasn’t an operation until nine o’clock and no announcement until—of a second operation until four o’clock in the afternoon.  Was the Fed listening to markets well ahead of time, going back a year when there were blowouts in the overnight rate at year-end and the turn of the year?  Are you concerned about how, for example, the New York Fed operated through this? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so I would say I doubt that anyone is closer to and has more invested in carefully following the—you know, the behavior of these markets.  So, of course, we were well aware of the—you know, the tax payments and also of the settlement of the large bond purchases.  And, you know, we were very much waiting for that.  But we didn’t expect—the response to that was stronger than we expected.  And, by the way, our sense is that it surprised market participants a lot, too.  You know, people were writing about this and publishing stories about it weeks ago.  It wasn’t a surprise, but it was—it was a stronger response  September 18, 2019  than—certainly than we expected.  So, no, I’m not concerned about that, to answer your   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL question.  I can go on a little bit about how we’re looking at that.  Why don’t I do that? So, as I mentioned, it doesn’t—we don’t see this as having any implications for the broader economy or for the economic outlook, nor for our ability to control rates.  The strains in the money markets reflect forces that we saw coming, and they just had a bigger effect than I think most folks anticipated—strong demand for cash to purchase Treasuries and pay corporate taxes.  We took appropriate actions to address those pressures, to keep the fed funds rate within the target range, and those measures were successful.  If we experience another episode of pressures in money markets, we have the tools to address those pressures.  We will not hesitate to use them. And since we’re talking about this, let me take a step back and say this.  Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the Committee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime.  And we’ve been operating in that regime for a full decade.  We think it works well to implement our rate rates—the IOER and RRP rates—to keep the fed fund rates in the target range.  It’s designed specifically so that we do not expect to be conducting frequent open market operations for that purpose.  So, going forward, we’re going to be very closely monitoring market developments and assessing their implications for the appropriate level of reserves, and we’re going to be assessing, you know, the question of when it will be appropriate to resume the organic growth of our balance sheet.  And I’m sure we’ll be revisiting that question during this intermeeting period and certainly at our next meeting.  September 18, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Could I just follow up here quickly?  Do you think you’ve underestimated the amount of reserves necessary for the banking system? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we’ve always said that it’s—that the level is uncertain, right?  And that’s something we’ve tried to be very clear about.  And as you know, we’ve invested lots of time talking to many of the large holders of reserves to assess their—what they say is their demand for reserves.  We try to assess what that is.  We’ve tried to combine all of that together.  We put it out so the public can react to it.  But, yes, there’s real uncertainty, and it is certainly possible that we will need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet earlier than we thought.  That’s always been a possibility, and it certainly is now.  Again, we’ll be looking at this carefully in coming days and taking it up at the next meeting. 

[SECTION]

BRENDAN GREELEY.  Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times.  Earlier this year—or, actually, in September, the Governors’ Board put out a research paper looking—trying to quantify trade uncertainty.  And it suggested that it could drag through the business investment channel on growth as much as a percentage point over the course of the next year.  How much confidence do you have in the Fed’s ability to estimate the real effects of trade uncertainty?  And if you have confidence in that paper, it would seem to suggest a—sort of a more aggressively dovish path than the one that you’ve chosen. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So I think to provide a little context, Fed economists do research all the time.  It’s generally of very high quality.  It’s their research.  It’s not an official finding of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve System.  It’s just—and, by the way, they put it out for public review so that you can see their econometrics, so you can see all of it—their whole work is exposed to critique by the whole profession.  So it’s a great tradition that we have.  And, you know, what this particular piece of work did is, it went after measuring trade  September 18, 2019  policy uncertainty through a couple of channels, including concerning tariffs, also concerning the   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   threat of more tariffs, and it looked deeply at the data to try to assess the effects on output.  And while I would say, directly answering your question, there’s real uncertainty around these—around these effects.  It’s a $22 trillion economy.  To try to isolate the effects of certain things is very challenging, but we do the best we can.  So—and this piece of research found significant effects, and that’s frankly consistent with a number of other research projects that economists have undertaken.  It’s also consistent with what we’ve been hearing in the Beige Book.  So, I mean, I think if you take a step back from that, we do feel that trade uncertainty is having an effect.  You see it in weak business investment, weak exports—hard to quantify it precisely, though. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters.  I was struck by the sort of anchored median federal funds rate here through 2020, and that in comparison to the fact that you now have sort of three very discrete groups of opinions around where the fed funds rate is heading.  And I wondered, is it fair to say that the—those opinions have become sort of firmer in their conviction, and that it’s going to take some sort of real material change in the outlook now for that to move in either direction? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  And you’re asking specifically about 2020? 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Well, the fact that this—the fed funds rate is now seen as not moving through 2020 suggests to me that these opinions are pretty—pretty well anchored right now in those groups. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, honestly, I think it’s hard to have hardened expectations about where rate policy is going to be a year from now.  I think the closer you get to the current day, the more confidence you can have.  But even then, knowing where the—knowing what the  September 18, 2019  data will say and the way geopolitical events and other events are going to evolve in the next   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL 90 days and the implications of that for the economy, I would say there’s a lot of uncertainty around that.   

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Fair enough, but if— 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Particularly, if you look at 2020, I think the use of this is, individual participants write down their forecasts.  It should give you a sense of how people are thinking about the likely path of the economy and the appropriate path for monetary policy in that individual person’s thinking, and I think that’s a good thing to know.  I think I’d be very reluctant to look at it as hardened views or a prediction, really. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  But just to follow up, if I could.  There were a number of arguments in July around the reason for cutting rates.  Have any of those gotten substantially weaker or changed around the table? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, well, I think, if you look at the U.S.—look at the U.S. economy, the U.S. economy has generally performed roughly as expected—roughly:  The consumer is spending at a healthy clip,  I’d say business fixed investment and exports have weakened further, and I’d say the manufacturing PMI suggests more weakness ahead.  The labor economy, I think, has weakened further in the EU and China, and I think, you know, trade policy developments have been a big mover of markets and of sentiment during that intermeeting period.  So that’s why I think what’s—that’s what’s happened over the intermeeting period, and, you know, different people around the table have different perspectives as you obviously know. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.  I’m just curious on your balance sheet point.  You talked about the Committee thinking about  September 18, 2019  resuming organic growth, you know, over time.  I guess the question is, if you have shrunk your   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   balance sheet maybe just a little bit too small to the point that reserves are too scarce to get through sort of these unusual periods, is organic growth in the balance sheet enough to get back to a point of ample reserves that can get us through those tough times, or would you need to see something a little bit above that?  And is that a possibility the Committee would consider? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I think it’s hard to deal with every hypothetical possibility.  I think, for the foreseeable future, we’re going to be looking at, if needed, doing the sorts of things that we did the last two days—these temporary open market operations.  That will be the tool that we use.  And the question will be, then—as we go through quarter-end, as we learn more, you know, what really—how much of this really has to do with the level of reserves?  And I think we’ll learn quite a lot in the next six weeks. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  Another money market question.  You know, banks have been pointing to liquidity rules as having contributed to some of the volatility we’ve seen in repo markets and, you know, potentially some capital rules as well.  Are you all looking at whether, you know, some tweaks to the liquidity coverage ratio might help?  And, also, what is the status of the net stable funding ratio rule?  Are you all still planning on putting that out soon? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so I think if we concluded that we needed to raise the level of required reserves for banks to meet the LCR, we’d probably raise the level of reserves rather than lower the LCR.  I mean, it’s not impossible that we would come to a view that the LCR is calibrated too high, but that’s not something that we think right now.  On the other hand, it might be that more reserves are needed, in which case we are in a position to supply them.  In  September 18, 2019  terms of the net stable funding ratio, it’s—I believe we put it out for comment and got   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL comments, and I believe we’re looking at—at finalizing that in the relatively near future. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Just—just to follow up, I mean, in terms of tweaks to the LCR, I mean, there’s also been some talk about potentially giving banks some room in times of stress to 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I think we want banks to, you know—to use their liquidity buffers in times of stress rather than pull back from the markets and pull back from serving their clients as a general rule. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  So, about a month ago—Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  About a month ago or so you said that there’s no precedent to integrate trade uncertainty into monetary policy.  In the last few weeks, have you figured out how to incorporate trade uncertainty—and this level of trade uncertainty—into monetary policy going forward?  You’ve talked about uncertainty many times today. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So my point, really, was that—to start, that trade policy is not the business of the Fed, it’s the business of Congress and the Administration.  But—so why are we talking about it?  We’re talking about it because anything that affects the achievement of our goals can, in principle, be something that monetary policy should take into consideration.  And our discussions and the research we have suggests that trade policy is something that’s weighing on the outlook.  So I pointed out in recent remarks that the thing we can’t address, really, is what businesses would like, which is a settled roadmap for international trade.  We can’t do that.  We don’t have that tool.  But we do have a very powerful tool which can counteract weakness, to some extent, by supporting demand through sound monetary policy.  And we think our policy tools support economic activity through fairly well-understood channels:  by reducing interest  September 18, 2019  burden and encouraging consumer purchase of durables, of homes, and other interest-sensitive   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL items; by creating broadly more accommodative financial conditions, which support spending and also investment by businesses; and also by boosting household and business confidence.  So, you know, I don’t want to be heard to say that our tools don’t have an effect.  They do.  But I was making the point that there is a piece of this that we really can’t address. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  So have you figured out how to navigatge it? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think, yeah.  I mean, it’s a challenge.  There’s no simple bottom-line answer where I can say, yes, I’ve got it for you here.  But what it amounts to is this:  What you see is probably the kind of volatility that’s typical of an important, complex, ongoing negotiation.  And I think what we need to do is to try to look through the volatility and react to the underlying forces, the underlying things that are happening that are relevant to our mandate.  We don’t—we have nothing to do with setting trade policy or negotiating trade agreements.  We’re supposed to be reacting on behalf of the American economy to support maximum employment and stable prices.  So we need to look through what’s a pretty volatile situation.  So that means not overreacting quickly.  It means not underreacting, too.  So that’s really what we’re trying to do.  And, you know, I would say, the outlook is positive in the face of these crosswinds we’ve felt.  And so, to some extent, I do believe that our shifting to a more accommodative stance over the course of the year has been one of the reasons why the outlook has remained favorable. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Fed funds—Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  Fed funds futures trading since the statement was released shows that investors still think that another rate cut is coming this year.  On their behalf, let me ask, what is going to guide Fed policy to either pull them towards where the dot plot suggests no more moves this year or  September 18, 2019  keep them in place?  Are you reacting to data now?  Are you reacting to your gut feeling about   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL what trade tweets might mean?  Should they just watch for Jay Powell speeches to decide what’s going to happen going forward?  What’s the Fed’s reaction function now? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So what we are looking for through all of the data, all the events that are going on around the world, we’ll be looking at, you know, the evolving geopolitical events, we’ll be looking at global growth, we’ll be looking at trade policy uncertainty.  Most importantly, we’ll be looking at the performance of the U.S. economy.  We’ll be looking for things that are affecting the outlook for the U.S. economy, particularly the outlook as it relates to maximum employment and stable prices.  So all of those things in principle can affect the achievement of our goals.  It’s an unusual situation, because, you know, the U.S. economy itself—the largest part of it, the consumer part of it—is in strong shape.  The manufacturing part, less so.  But, overall, you see an economy that—I think, generally, forecasts show growth similar to our own, forecasts coming in about 2 percent, which is a good, solid year.  So the difference here is, we have significant, really, risks to that outlook from not just the geopolitical events, but also from slowing global growth and trade policy uncertainty.  So we’ll be looking at all of that and also financial market conditions and how they are affecting the outlook.  I can’t—it’s a challenging time, I admit it, but we really have to be open to all those things.  We’re not on a preset course.  We’re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting as we see this, and, you know, we’ll try to be as transparent as we can as we go. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Donna Borak with CNN.  With the rate cut today and potentially another modest adjustment coming down the road, do you worry about lessening the Fed’s firepower should there be a recession?  And is there any  September 18, 2019  scenario in which you would envision rates drifting lower into negative territory?  And are there   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   any other tools that you could use before having to go there?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, in terms of firepower, I think the general principle, as I mentioned earlier, is, it can be a mistake to try to hold onto your firepower until a downturn gains momentum, and then—so there’s a fair amount of research that would show that that’s the case.  Now, I think that principle needs to be applied carefully to the situation at hand.  What we believe we’re facing here—what we think we’re facing here is a situation which can be addressed and should be addressed with moderate adjustments to the federal funds rate.  As I mentioned, we are watching carefully to see whether that is the case.  If, in fact, the economy weakens more, then we’re prepared to be aggressive, and we’ll do so if it turns out to be appropriate. You mentioned negative interest rates.  So negative interest rates is something that we looked at during the financial crisis and chose not to do.  We chose to—after we got to the effective lower bound, we chose to do a lot of aggressive forward guidance and also large-scale asset purchases, and those were the two unconventional monetary policy tools that we used extensively.  We feel that they worked fairly well.  We did not use negative rates.  And I think if we were to find ourselves at some future date again at the effective lower bound—again, not something we are expecting—then I think we would look at using large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance.  I do not think we’d be looking at using negative rates.  I just don’t think those will be at the top of our list. By the way, we are in the middle of a monetary policy review where we’re looking through all of these questions about the longer-run framework—the strategy, tools, and communications—and we expect that to be completed sometime around the middle of next year.  September 18, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times.  How much—can you talk about the mechanism in which the two rate cuts will affect the real economy?  And how much—to what extent will it offset the negative effects of the trade uncertainty and tensions? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, in terms of how our rate cuts will affect the real economy, first, we think monetary policy works with, as Friedman said, long and variable lags.  So I think the real effects will be felt over time.  But, you know, we think that lower interest rates will reduce interest burden for borrowers, so that interest-sensitive things like housing and durable goods and other things like that—cars—it supports purchases of those.  Just, again, broadly, more accommodative financial conditions—higher asset prices.  That’s—the models and the data show that that’s another powerful channel. I also think there’s a confidence channel.  You see—you see household and business confidence turn up when financial conditions become more accommodative.  So I think, through all of those channels, monetary policy works.  It isn’t, you know, precisely the right tool for every single possible negative thing that can happen to the economy, but, nonetheless, it broadly works, and, you know, we’re going to use the tool we have.  And if it comes to it, we’ll use all of our tools.  So that’s how we think it works and how we think it’s working. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  And how much will it offset the trade impact, do you think? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  It’s very hard to say.  It’s—you know, it’s tough to say.  We’ll—we’ll use our tools to offset negative—that’s really the job of monetary policy, is, to the extent it can, to offset, you know, things that drive us away from maximum employment and stable 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  I’m Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, are you worried that the low interest rates are adding to, or could create a bubble of, prices.  September 18, 2019  consumer and corporate debt that could make it more difficult for, especially, consumers to   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL recover from the next recession or survive the next recession? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so, if you look at—if you actually look at households, households are in very strong shape.  They’re less levered.  They’ve got less debt.  They’ve got more income relative to their interest requirements.  And they’re in very good shape—much better shape than they were in before the financial crisis.  So the household sector as a sort of aggregate matter is in very good shape.  That doesn’t mean that every single person in the household sector is in good shape, but, overall, it’s really not a concern. The business sector is something that, you know, we’ve talked about a lot and studied a lot, and the situation there is that the level of debt relative to GDP in the business sector is at a high level.  However, so is the size of the business sector.  So, actually, the business sector itself is not materially higher leveraged than it was.  Nonetheless, there are a lot of highly levered companies, and that’s the kind of thing that happens during a long cycle when there aren’t downturns for, now, into our 11th year.  You get—you know, you do get that kind of phenomenon in a long cycle. So that’s something we’re monitoring, and I think our view still is that that’s a real issue, but what it really represents is a potential amplifier of a macroeconomic downturn.  It does not have the makings of anything that would undermine the workings of the financial system, for example, or itself create a shock that would turn the economy down.  It’s more of—it’s more of an amplifier.  We take it very seriously, though, and, you know, we’re monitoring it carefully.  We’re actually looking—the Financial Stability Board is actually conducting a project right now to identify where these loans are held all around the world.  So it’s the subject of a lot of study and work, and, you know, we’re trying to keep on top of it.  September 18, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Chairman Powell.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  I’m kind of hearing two things from you.  You’re saying that the economy is doing well, but there’s this sense with people that the economy is actually starting to slow now.  And people are—more and more, you talk—there’s talk about recession, so you—and even the Fed thinks the downside risks are rising.  So is the economy over the next year—between now and the end of next year, do you think GDP growth is going to hold steady, and the unemployment rate—could you talk about, just, how do you see the economy evolving over the next year? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so, I think—and my colleagues and I, I think, all think that the most likely case is for continued moderate growth, continued strong labor market, and inflation moving back up to 2 percent.  And I think that’s, by the way, widely shared among forecasters.  You know, the issue is more the risks to that.  You have downside risks here, and we’ve talked about them.  It’s that global growth will have an effect on U.S. growth over time— less so than for many other economies, but, still, there’s a sector of our economy that’s exposed to that.  Trade policy uncertainty also has—apparently has an effect.  So—and you can see some weakness in the U.S. economy because of all that.  But, nonetheless—so the job of monetary policy is to adjust both to ensure against those downside risks, but also to support the economy in light of the existing weakness that we do see.  So we’re not—as I mentioned, we’re not—we don’t see a recession.  We’re not forecasting a recession.  But we are adjusting monetary policy in a more accommodative direction to try to support what is, in fact, a favorable outlook. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  And the inverted yield curve that we hear is the bond market signaling recession—what do you—is that—so that’s not—that signal is not pertinent to you?  Or where do you—  September 18, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  No, we do—so we monitor the yield curve carefully, along with a large, wide range of financial conditions.  We don’t—so, it’s not—there’s no one thing that is dispositive among all financial conditions.  The yield curve is something that we follow carefully.  And, again, based on our assessment of all the data, we still think it’s a positive outlook.  The thing—so, just to talk about the current situation, you see—you saw long-term rates move down a whole lot and then retrace two-thirds of that move in the space of a few days.  So I think what really matters for all financial conditions generally is when there are changes—material changes that are sustained for a period of time. So—but why are long-term rates low?  There are a number—there can be a signal about expectations about growth there for sure, but there can also just be low term premiums.  For example, just—well, it can just be that there’s this large quantity of negative-yielding and very low-yielding sovereign debt around the world, and, inevitably, that’s exerting downward pressure on U.S. sovereign rates without really necessarily having an independent signal.  Nonetheless, that is a signal about weak global growth, probably, and weak global growth would affect us.  So global capital markets and the global economy are quite integrated, so this is something we pay careful—we’re not going to be dismissive about the yield curve, but—and I think you can tell, on the Committee, there’s a range of views—there are some who are very focused on the yield curve, others not so much.  You know, from my perspective, you watch it carefully, and, you know, I think you need to be asking yourself a lot of questions if the yield curve is inverted as to why that is and how long it’s sustained.

PAUL KIERNAN.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.  You mentioned trade policy being a complex, ongoing discussion.  What is your rule for stopping as far as interest rate cuts go?  You referred to this as a “midcycle adjustment.”  The  September 18, 2019  median dot suggests no more rate cuts, but, you know, if we get continued kind of back-and-  Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL forth between the U.S. and China, trade policy uncertainty is going to remain heightened.  So, you know, under what circumstances would you say, “You know what, I think we’ve cut enough, we stop now”?  And, secondly, as leader of this institution, have you felt a need to take any steps to boost, like, employee morale at a time when the President is constantly criticizing the Fed?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I’d love to be able to articulate a simple, straightforward stopping rule, but it’s really just going to be when we think we’ve done enough.  And, you know, our eyes are open.  We’re watching the situation.  We’ve cut rates twice.  We’ve moved, really, through the course of this year, as I discussed, and, you know, we see ourselves as taking actions to sustain the expansion and thereby achieve our goals.  And if you look at sort of the things that are happening in the economy, I think I personally see a high value in sustaining the expansion, because we really are reaching—this positive economy is reaching communities that haven’t been reached in a long time.  There would be great benefit in having that last as long as possible, that’s all.  So I don’t have a specific stopping rule for you, but I think we’re watching carefully, and there will come a time, I suspect, when we think we’ve done enough, but there may also come a time when the economy worsens, and we would then have to cut more aggressively.  We don’t know.  We’re going to be watching things carefully.  The incoming data and the evolving situation and—that’s what’s going to guide our—guide us on that path. In terms of the morale of the institution, I would say it’s very high.  We’re very unified.  We feel like we’re doing the best job we can in serving the American people. 

[SECTION]

HANNAH LANG.  Hi, Chairman.  Hannah Lang with American Banker.  It’s been reported that the CFPB is investigating Bank of America for opening unauthorized accounts.   September 18, 2019  I’m wondering if the Fed is also investigating this and, given the pending order against Wells   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL Fargo, if you’re concerned that these banks are too big to manage. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so I saw the headline, like, this morning during all of the preparation and everything and this morning’s meeting.  I really don’t have anything for you on that.  I will say about Wells Fargo that, you know, there were quite wide breakdowns in risk management which resulted in, you know, mistreatment of consumers that we know was quite harmful to the consumers and to the image of the institution.  I have no idea whether that’s what happened at Bank of America.  I really don’t know, standing here today. 

[SECTION]

STEVEN BECKNER.  Steve Beckner filing for NPR, freelance.  The Fed and your fellow central banks have been sort of exploring the far reaches of what’s possible for monetary policy, even going so far as to make rates negative in some cases, with mixed results.  Meanwhile, fiscal and regulatory, not to mention trade, policy are pursuing their own separate courses.  As you and your colleagues do this monetary policy framework review, do you ever consider the limitations of monetary policy?  Should you be more explicit about what monetary policy can and cannot do in this environment? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we try to be clear about that, but, really, I think our job is to use our tools as best we can to achieve—you know, to do the jobs that Congress has assigned us, which is achieve maximum employment and stable prices.  That’s our real job. In terms of giving the fiscal authorities—who, by the way, are the ones who created us—advice about how to do their job, you know, we keep that at a high level, I think.  And, at a high level, yes, I would say, and I’ve said before, that it’s really fiscal policy that is more powerful and that has much more to do with—fiscal policy can do those things that will increase the longer-run growth rate of the United States by improving productivity and labor force  September 18, 2019  participation and the skills and aptitudes of workers.  All of that comes from the private sector,   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL but also from more of the kinds of things that can be done with fiscal policy. Over the long run, we can’t really affect the growth rate of the United States.  The potential growth rate of the United States is not a function of monetary policy.  It’s a function of other things.  So I—I try to be clear about that, and so—but, ultimately, fiscal—fiscal authorities will do what they seem—deem appropriate. 

[SECTION]

SAMIRA HUSSAIN.  Samira Hussain, BBC News.  Mr. Trump has been a very vocal critic of you and your colleagues, recently calling you “boneheads” and just now has called you a “terrible communicator.”  How do you respond to these criticisms?  And any regrets to have this many press conferences? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I don’t.  I’m not going to change my practice here today of not responding to comments or addressing comments made by elected officials.  I will just say that I continue to believe that the independence of the Federal Reserve from direct political control has served the public well over time.  And I assure you that my colleagues and I will continue to conduct monetary policy without regard to political considerations.  We’re going to use our best judgment based on facts, evidence, and objective analysis in pursuing our goals, and that’s what I have to say on it. 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  Thanks for taking my question.  As we saw with falling yields, at least up until the beginning of this month, there’s been a lot of demand for U.S. Treasuries, and even that was partly maybe to blame for the liquidity crunch in repo markets that we saw this week.  I mean, does the Fed have concerns over the impacts of a global glut for U.S. debt?  Is that a conversation that you also  September 18, 2019  have with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin—about what the proper way to maybe address some of   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL the challenges down the road with that type of, kind of, heavy interest globally? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Not really, no.  That’s really—that’s really Treasury’s job and Congress’s job, in terms of, well, there’s how much to spend, and how big the deficits are, and then there’s how to finance it.  And, you know, none of that really calls for advice from the Fed.  We take—we take fiscal policy pretty much as exogenous to our work.  Now, that doesn’t stop us, from time to time, from saying that we think it’s important that the U.S. fiscal picture return to a sustainable footing, and, you know, right now it’s not.  That’s been the case for a long time, and that’s something we will have to address, and a good time to do it is when the economy is strong.  So we limit ourselves to high-level statements like that. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post.  Mr. Chairman, in your view, is there any risk to the United States having much higher interest rates than Europe and Japan and other parts of the world?  Is there any risk to the U.S. economy to that divergence or any risk to the global economy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, so I guess I would say it this way.  Global capital markets are highly integrated, and, you know, our rates—our long rates are definitely being pulled down by the very, very low rates that are abroad.  And, you know, the way I would characterize it is this:  that low rates abroad are a symbol—or a sign, rather, of weak global growth, expectations of low inflation, low growth, and, you know, just kind of a lack of policy space to move against or ideas about how to break out of that low equilibrium.  Now, that has implications for us.  You know, we—in a world where economies and financial markets are tightly integrated, that matters for the U.S. economy.  So that’s going to pull down U.S. rates, and U.S. financial conditions can tighten because of that.  And so I think we put all—all of that goes into our thinking and into our  September 18, 2019  models.  We do understand how the—you know, how the international sector interfaces with the   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   U.S. economy.  We take that into account in setting our interest rate policy.  Thank you very much.   ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
30,2019-10-30,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon, and welcome.  My colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people.  We do this by steadfastly pursuing the goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and stable prices.  We’re committed to making the best decisions we can based on facts and objective analysis. Today we decided to lower the interest rates for the third time this year.  We took this step to help keep the U.S. economy strong in the face of global developments and to provide some insurance against ongoing risks.  As I will explain shortly, the policy adjustments we have made since last year are providing—and will continue to provide—meaningful support to the economy.  We believe that monetary policy is in a good place. The U.S. economy is in its 11th year of expansion, and the baseline outlook remains favorable.  The overall economy is growing at a moderate rate.  Household spending continues to be strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence.  In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the past year.  Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on those sectors.  Looking ahead, we continue to expect the economy to expand at a moderate rate, reflecting solid household spending and supportive financial conditions. The job market remains strong.  The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for a year and a half.  The pace of job gains has eased this year but has remained solid; we had expected some slowing after last year’s strong pace.  Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years has been increasing, and wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs.  People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better  October 30, 2019  chapters to their lives.  This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   the strong job market reaches more of those left behind. Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.  Over the 12 months through August, total PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation was 1.8 percent.  Inflation pressures remain muted, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historic ranges.  We’re mindful that continued below-target inflation could lead to an unwelcome downward slide in long-term inflation expectations.  However, against the backdrop of a strong economy and supportive monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent. Overall, we continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, a strong labor our outlook for quite some time, our views about the path of interest rates that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year.  As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade developments have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks.  These factors, in conjunction with muted inflation pressures, have led us to lower our assessment of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the past year.  In both July and September, we reduced the target rate [range] for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, and we did so again today, bringing the range to 1½ to 1¾ percent. The policy adjustments we’ve made to date will continue to provide significant support for the economy.  Since monetary policy operates with a lag, the full effects of these adjustments on economic growth, the job market, and inflation will be realized over time.  We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective.  We believe monetary policy  October 30, 2019  is in a good place to achieve these outcomes.  Looking ahead, we’ll be monitoring the effects of   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   our policy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the fed funds rate.  Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.  Policy is not on a preset course. Let me end with a few words about our technical monetary policy operations.  In January, we made the key decision to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime.  In that operating framework, we control the federal funds rate primarily by setting our administered rates, not through frequent interventions to actively manage the supply of reserves.  In the transition to the efficient and effective level of reserves in this regime, we slowed the gradual decline in our balance sheet in March and we stopped it in July. In response to the funding pressures in money markets that emerged in mid-September, we concluded that it would be appropriate to maintain, over a time—over time, a level of reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September of this year.  To achieve this ample level, we announced on October 11 that we would purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year as well as continue temporary open market operations at least through January. These actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of monetary policy as we continue to learn about the appropriate level of reserves.  They do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.  In particular, our Treasury bill purchases should not be confused with the large-scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis.  In those programs, we purchased longer-term securities to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and ease broader financial conditions.  In contrast,  October 30, 2019  increasing the supply of reserves by purchasing Treasury bills only alters the mix of short-term   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL assets held by the public and should not materially affect demand and supply for longer-term securities or financial conditions more broadly. Thank you.  I will be happy to take your questions. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.  So I guess the question is, is this it?  Do you consider rates to be accommodative enough now to achieve your goal of sustaining the expansion?  And as far as global Wall Street’s primary question, what kind of change in the economy would cause you to reassess—some sort of significant deterioration in what? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So what we’ve said, to repeat, is that we see the current stance of policy as “likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook.”  And we say that, really, because both of the performance of the economy and the stance of policy.  The performance of the economy has been—particularly the household sector—has been strong, has been resilient, with low unemployment, attractive levels of job creation, wages moving up, labor force participation moving up, household confidence, and solid gains in many measures of consumer spending.  The manufacturing sector, particularly manufacturing, and also investment and exports have been weaker.  But, overall, we’ve seen moderate growth, a strong labor market, inflation moving up.  We see the outlook as for more of the same.  We also see the risks to the outlook as perhaps having moved in a positive direction over the course of this intermeeting period, although, some remain—some things remain to be seen.  So that’s the economy. Turning to policy, we’ve moved the stance of policy over the course of the year to a more accommodative stance, and, after the cuts at the last three meetings, the federal funds rate is now  October 30, 2019  in a range between 1½ and 1¾ percent.  We feel that policy is well positioned to support the   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL outlook that I described.  So you asked what it would take, you know, to move, and, as I mentioned, we’re going to be watching all factors,  And if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.  But that’s what it would take:  a material reassessment of our outlook. rates again, will you be forced to follow? 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  If I could follow up—if the markets decide that you need to cut 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We’ll be looking at a full range of data about the economy and about the risks to the outlook, and I’ve given you a sense of what our outlook is.  It’s for moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 percent objective.  If something happens to cause us to materially reassess that outlook, that’s what would cause us to change our views on the appropriate stance of policy. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post.  You just said that the risks to the outlook are moving in a positive direction.  I’m wondering if you could specify—is that on trade, or are there other matters?  This morning we obviously learned that we’ve now had two quarters of contracting business investment, which would seem to be moving the outlook in the other direction. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, in terms of risks, what I was referring to there—the principal risks that we’ve been monitoring have been, really, slowing global growth and trade policy developments as well as muted inflation pressure.  So I was really referring there to trade developments.  We have that phase-one potential agreement with China, which, if signed and put into effect, could have the effect of reducing trade tensions and reducing uncertainty, and that would bode well, we think, for business confidence and perhaps activity over time.  So that has  October 30, 2019  the potential for being an improvement in the risk picture.  Brexit, I would say, as well—it   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL appears that the risk of a no-deal Brexit seems to have materially declined.  I think on both situations there’s plenty of risk left, but I’d have to say that the risks seem to have subsided. You asked about business investment, and that’s right.  Business investment has been weak, and today’s reading was weak as well.  And it was broad across equipment and other parts of—all parts of business fixed investment were weak.  That’s consistent with what we’ve seen, but that’s the economy we’ve had this year.  What we’ve had is an economy where the consumer is really driving growth, and, you know, personal consumption expenditures were almost 3 percent in this quarter—in this first reading for the quarter.  So, overall, we see the economy as having been resilient to the—you know, the winds that have been blowing this year. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Can I just follow up quickly?  I mean, there’s this concern that I sometimes hear that, with business, businesses have cut investment, and are they going to turn around and cut employment?  You know, sort of, if they continue to be concerned.  Can you give a sense of how the Committee is thinking—thinking through that possibility? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, so that is a risk.  That’s a risk that we’ve been monitoring, but we don’t see it yet.  We don’t see rising initial claims or layoffs or anything like that.  But the risk you mention of the weakness in the manufacturing—in export investment, business investment, parts of the economy getting into the consumer side of the economy, we really don’t see that. What we continue to see is good job creation.  Unemployment has declined again, and the household survey is now at a 50-year low—has been, you know, very close to 50-year lows for 18 months now.  So it’s very positive.  The consumer-facing companies that we talk to in our vast network of contacts report, you know, that consumers are doing well and are focused on,  October 30, 2019  you know, the good job market and rising incomes, and that’s their principle focus.  So that is the   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   thing that’s pushing the economy forward, and it doesn’t seem to have been affected so far by weakness in the other areas. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.  Thanks for taking our questions.  So you’ve previously sort of compared this rate-cutting cycle to the insurance cuts in the ’90s, and in both of those instances, the Greenspan Fed took those cuts back after a while.  They raised rates again fairly quickly.  And I guess I’m just curious what the onus is for doing that in this cycle.  What would make you guys decide it’s appropriate to raise interest rates again? see that risk. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So the reason why we raised interest rates is because—generally is because we see inflation as moving up—or, in danger of moving up significantly, and we really don’t see that now.  Inflation moved down in the first quarter of this year.  We thought that that was due, to some extent, to idiosyncratic or transient factors.  That turns out to have been the case, so it’s moved back up.  But it seems to be settling in below 2 percent.  So we really don’t And inflation expectations have also kind of moved down and sideways—both surveys and market based over the course of this—of, really, the recent months.  And, you know, we think that inflation expectations are very important in driving actual inflation, and we’re strongly committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation objective on a symmetric basis.  We think it’s essential that we do that. So we’re not thinking about raising rates right now.  There obviously will be times in the future where that will be appropriate.  What we’re really thinking now is that our current stance  October 30, 2019  of policy is appropriate and will remain so as long as the outlook is broadly in keeping with our   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   expectations. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr.—Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, I’m—not to make light of it, but I’m a little bit—I wonder if you could help me out with the appropriate understanding of the word “appropriate” here.  So the statement says that the Committee is going “to monitor the implications of incoming information for the outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range.”  That tells me you could go either way.  You came in, and you used the word “appropriate,” that the current rate is “likely to remain appropriate,” which means you’re on hold.  So how do I walk away from this, and what should we walk away from this believing what “appropriate” means?  Are you on hold and need to be proved wrong that you should remain on hold, or is it, really, you could go either way here?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we think that the current stance of policy is likely to remain appropriate—likely to remain appropriate—as long as incoming information about the economy is broadly consistent with our outlook, which is a positive one of moderate economic growth, strong labor market, and inflation moving close to 2 percent.  That’s—so that’s what we’re saying about that.  We also say, of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of that outlook, we would respond accordingly.  So that’s really how we’re thinking about it.  I can’t point to one data point or one thing that would change our minds.  It really—it would be a reassessment of—a material reassessment of our overall outlook, which is what I described. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  I’m sorry, just to—why isn’t the phrase “likely to remain appropriate” in the statement if that’s the sense of the Committee?  October 30, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, there’s—there’s a lot of, you know, practice and science and history, in terms of how much you put in the actual postmeeting statement as opposed to what we say in the press conference statement.  It’s a—you know, it’s a judgment call.  You know, I’m saying it now, so— 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos with the Wall Street Journal.  You described the recent slide, Chair Powell, in inflation expectations as “unwelcome.”  You said that inflation expectations are “very important.”  What, if anything, would the Committee be prepared to do to address this slide in inflation expectations if it continued? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, as I mentioned, we do think that inflation expectations are—they’re quite essential, quite central in our framework of how we think about inflation.  We need them to be anchored in a level—at a level that’s consistent with our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal.  And we think that we need to conduct policy in a way that supports that outcome.  That’s what we’re doing now. We’re also, as part of our review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us—that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent—on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time.  That’s at the very heart of what we’re doing in the review.  It’s too early to be announcing can make that symmetric 2 percent inflation objective more credible by achieving symmetric 2 percent inflation.  And it comes down to using your policy tools to achieve 2 percent inflation, and that is the—that is the thing that must happen for credibility in this area.  So we’re committed to doing that.     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  How soon do you think that review might be announced to the  public? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we’re in the middle—we’re really quite in the middle of it now, and my thinking is still that it will run into the middle of next year.  These are—you know, these changes to monetary policy frameworks happen—they don’t happen really quickly, let’s say.  Inflation targeting took many years to evolve.  I don’t think we’ll take many years here.  I think we’ll wrap it up around the middle of next year, would be my guess.  I have some confidence in that. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence of Fox Business.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking this.  So how big of a change, then, to monetary policy would there be if you get some of that uncertainty cleared up—specifically, the phase-one China trade deal finished and USMCA ratified?  How big of a change could that be to the monetary policy as it stands here, and could we see rate cuts next year—or, rate hikes next year?  I’m sorry. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Rate hikes for next year. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Yes, because I’ve heard the argument that trade’s causing the uncertainty.  Uncertainty is keeping the prices low.  I’ve heard that argument from a Fed president from one of the Districts.  So you remove that uncertainty, prices, then, would naturally rise.  So could there be a point, or how—I guess my question is, how big of an impact on monetary policy would removing that uncertainty be? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So I would just say that a—if we were to have a sustained reduction in trade tensions—broad reduction in trade tensions and a resolution of these uncertainties, that would bode well for business sentiment, which is—trade uncertainty’s been weighing on business sentiment, in our judgment, in the judgment of many analysts.  And,  October 30, 2019  ultimately, it could affect activity.  I wouldn’t expect that the effects on activity or confidence   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL would be immediate, or—would there be immediate effects in economic activity.  I think it would take some time after the recent things, but I do think it would be quite positive over time. You come back to the question of raising rates.  So that’s really about inflation.  And you know, we haven’t yet—we just touched 2 percent core inflation, to pick one measure—just touched it for a few months, and then we’ve fallen back.  So I think we would need to see a really significant move up in inflation that’s persistent before we would consider raising rates to address inflation concerns. 

[SECTION]

BRENDAN GREELEY.  Brendan Greeley, the Financial Times.  The other thing you’ve talked about in this review is the gains that a super high-pressure labor market have, particularly for the communities that you’re talking about.  You mentioned it just now when you were talking.  If that’s something that you’re identifying, and that’s something that the Fed is learning more about this year, why not continue to push those gains, particularly for people who are reentering the labor force? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think we’re doing that.  I mean, I think we’re keeping—I think we’ve made very substantial adjustments to policy over the course of this year, if you think about it.  We entered the year expecting some further rate increases, we went to “patient,” now we’ve done three rate cuts.  It’s a very substantial shift, and the effects of it will be felt over time.  So we feel like those shifts are appropriate to support exactly the outcomes you’re talking about, which are a continuing strong labor market, continued strong job creation. 

[SECTION]

BRENDAN GREELEY.  So if you were to describe the shifts that you’ve made so far, it wasn’t just about trade uncertainty.  It was about, specifically, these kinds of high-pressure labor gains that you’ve talked about.  October 30, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, no.  It was—so we’ve said it was about three things.  It’s been about the slowing global economy.  You have a synchronized slowdown in economic activity around the globe.  It’s been building for just about 18 months now, and that’s having an effect on U.S. activity.  That’s part of the weakness in manufacturing, export, and business investment.  We’ve had trade policy uncertainty, which we think also has been weighing on activity and investment and sentiment.  And we’ve had inflation, which—we’ve called out the risk of inflation running persistently below 2 percent as a risk that we needed to address.  So we’ve been doing it to address all of those things. I would say, the gains in the labor market have been great to see.  It’s particularly the fact that people at the lower end of wages have been getting most of the benefit of most of the wage gains in the last couple of years.  That’s a great thing.  You know from our Fed Listens events that we’ve been hearing from people who live and work in low- and moderate-income communities that this is the best labor market they’ve seen in their lifetime, things like that. And, by the way, that there’s also—there’s still so many people who are, you know, still not in the labor market yet, and that—there’s just a lot more good that can be done there.  At the same time, we have to think about the whole economy, and—but, yes, those gains are very positive.  We do call them out.  They are a reason for us to want to extend the expansion, and that’s something we’re committed to doing. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  On the Fed’s balance sheet—you all recently resumed purchases of Treasury bills, and I was just wondering, how long do you expect that to continue?  And, given the fact that, you know, the repo operations—it seems like the Fed is having to increase the amount of liquidity—temporary liquidity that it’s injecting into the system.  You know, do you  October 30, 2019  still feel like it’s just—that there is not enough reserves in the system?  Do you feel like you have   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   a good sense of what’s going on there? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  So, on the “how long,” what we’ve said is that we expect bill purchases to continue at least into the second quarter of next year.  And we’ve said that temporary open market operations we expect to continue, I think, at least until the end of In terms of the causes, so there’s a lot of forensic work going on by us and by market participants and all kinds of analysts.  And, you know, one thing is that we think we need reserves to be back up to the level—the minimum level of reserves that we can have during the various fluctuations that you see with reserves is something like $1.45 trillion or a little higher, and that’s the level in early September.  So we’re going to be adding reserves to get back to that place.  That’s one thing. There are also—it may be—one thing that was surprising about the episode was that liquidity didn’t seem to flow as one might have expected.  We had surveyed the banks carefully about what was their lowest comfortable level of reserves, and many banks that were well above that level did not take that excess cash and invest it in the repo market at much higher rates.  They just—they didn’t do that, and so the question is why.  And are there things that we can do that would—adjustments that we could make that would allow liquidity to flow more easily in the system without in any way sacrificing safety and soundness or financial stability?  So we’re looking at those.  Those are not things that can happen that can really address the situation in the short term, but those are a range of things that we’re looking at as well. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the questions.  I wonder if you could give us a little more texture on, sort of, what the strongest or most  October 30, 2019  important case is for feeling that you’ve now taken out adequate insurance.  Is it the response   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL you’re seeing in housing and other parts of the economy, arguably, to the cuts made so far?  Is it the fact that the risk environment out there globally has shifted a bit and abated a bit?  Or is it something different, you know, in the financial markets, the fact that the yield curve has righted itself, et cetera? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Honestly, it’s really the—there isn’t any one factor.  It’s really the whole range of economic data and also what we see as—about our stance of policy, which we believe is the appropriate stance.  It’s really both of those things.  Again, if you look at the performance of the economy through this, the consumer sector has been quite resilient.  Witness today’s GDP report.  And it’s just—again, all the things I went through earlier suggest that that sector continues to be strong.  We know that the manufacturing, investment, trade, export sector has been weak.  That continues, but nonetheless, overall, we’ve got an economy that is showing moderate growth, and we think that today’s setting—we’re now at 1.5 to 1.75 percent.  That is, we believe, an accommodative level and a level that will support that outlook that we have. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  But are you concerned—just to follow up, really.  This is kind of a one-legged recovery, that unless you get some impetus from other things—exports, investment—that it’s going to weaken further at some point? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we don’t see any evidence of that.  What we see is—what we see is that the consumer sector continues strong.  Again, low initial claims.  It’s all—the data we monitor, obviously, is a very broad range of data.  We also see now, I think, more clearly the effects of more accommodative monetary policy on various kinds of consumer activity.  You’re seeing strong durable goods sales.  You’re seeing housing now contributing to growth for the first time in a while—two-tenths, I think, this quarter.  And you’re seeing retail sales—the retail  October 30, 2019  sales number, the PCE number, as I mentioned, in today’s release was 2.9 percent.  So that’s   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL good.  And I think, more broadly, monetary policy is also supporting household spending and home buying by keeping the labor market strong, keeping workers’ incomes rising, and keeping consumer confidence at high levels, where it currently is. 

[SECTION]

SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You were just talking about how the lower rates have affected consumer behavior.  Is there a concern that there’s just less potency on the business investment side that you’re, in effect, pushing on a string? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think monetary policy works through the channels that we understand.  I think the effects are clear in what we think of as the interest-rate-sensitive sectors, which are the ones—some of the ones that I mentioned.  I think it’s—I think interest rates are a factor in business investment, but I don’t believe they’re the main factor and main driver.  And I think, you know, what one would like to see for—to support greater manufacturing activity, business investment, and exports would be a global recovery.  And, you know, there’s a lot of monetary policy accommodation and some fiscal accommodation, maybe, in the global economy now.  Not here, but perhaps elsewhere.  And that should turn—that should support growth in the global economy.  And, again, resolution of our trade issues would contribute to that over time as well. 

[SECTION]

CHRIS RUGABER.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  You mentioned Fed Listens a couple of times, and what you’ve heard from people there about how it’s benefited the disadvantaged or lower-income workers—the hot job market we have.  Has the Fed thought about institutionalizing something like Fed Listens and maybe taking in some of this input from people that you don’t always hear from—things like the Beige Book focus on  October 30, 2019  businesses?  Has there been thought of bringing in folks, say, from community groups more   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL regularly?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We think—we think that Fed Listens has been a great success for us, and I’m sure we will repeat it.  In fact, I would imagine that this entire monetary policy review will become institutionalized and be done every few years.  I would say this:  In the Beige Book, we talk to educational institutions, health-care institutions, community groups, labor groups—it’s not just businesses.  And, by the way, all of those groups are also represented on the boards of our regional banks. We also meet quite regularly at the Board with representatives of low- and moderate-income communities.  And so we’re—we’re very conscious of—you know, that we represent all Americans, and we need to hear all of their perspectives.  That’s why we—you know, we talk about how low the unemployment rate is, the aggregate unemployment, but we also talk about groups that haven’t experienced that yet.  And so we’re—we try to remind ourselves that we serve everybody. year and next year? 

[SECTION]

STEVE MATTHEWS.  Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.  You mentioned housing and today’s GDP data.  When you look at that, do you believe that you have achieved a soft landing or are achieving a soft landing, in the sense that we’re moving to trend growth for the rest of the 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So that is—our outlook overall is for moderate growth of around 2 percent, which is pretty close to trend.  That’s our outlook:  could be better, could be worse.  You know, it’s—you never say you’ve achieved it.  But that’s our outlook.  And we feel like our current stance of policy is appropriate as long as that remains broadly our outlook.  October 30, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak with CNN.  Chair Powell, setting aside market expectations for today’s rate cut—obviously, 97 percent sort of expected that this would happen today—can you tell us a little bit more about the rationale behind moving at this particular meeting as opposed to waiting six weeks and cutting in December, and if there was any discussion about that around the table?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  I think this seems to be the right movement.  You can see that we had our usual range of perspectives, range of views.  But, in the end, we had a strong vote in favor of this action.  I strongly believe it’s the right action.  I strongly believe that the actions we’ve taken over the course of this year have been the right things to do for this economy and are supporting economic growth and will do so in the future.  So— 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Chairman Powell, it seems that the differences all across the country—that different regions are reacting differently to the China trade, and some regions are much weaker than others.  There’s this urban versus rural divide, the coasts versus the middle of the country.  How does that factor into your policy 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, it’s—monetary policy is famously a blunt instrument.  So we can’t—obviously, we can’t raise interest rates some place and lower them other places.  But we’re very conscious.  The first thing to know is to understand that, that—and we’ve called that out, as you, I’m sure, know, in one of our recent Monetary Policy Reports to Congress.  The sort of rural–urban disparities in—you know, in employment, in growth, in all kinds of things, in health outcomes.  You know, it’s a big and growing difference—set of differences.  We don’t really have, you know, the tools to address that, but we call things out that are important to our economy that we may not be—that we might have—may not have the right tools to best address  October 30, 2019  them, but we call them out because, you know, we’re spending all of our time with the economy,   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   and those are issues that maybe have to be addressed by legislatures and, you know, by—at the national level and at the state level. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Oh, could I follow?  Sorry, could I follow?  Could—sorry.  Just, so—so are you asking Congress to do something now, or will you ask them to do something down the road? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I’m not asking Congress to do anything right now.  I sometimes have noted that it would be appropriate.  Let me put it this way:  We do what we do, which is, we’re assigned a job, which is maximum employment and stable prices.  We do financial stability.  We do bank regulation.  The U.S. economy faces significant longer-term challenges around potential growth, around labor force participation, around disparities of income and wealth, around all kinds of things.  And those are issues for Congress, and they’re not issues for us.  But if you really want the U.S. economy to be all it can be and raise the potential growth rate of the United States, you need—you need proper monetary policy.  But, really, it isn’t monetary policy.  Really, it’s fiscal policy that supports, you know, inclusive growth. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times.  I think you said, Chair Powell, that the primary positive development in risks to the outlook was on trade and, specifically, the prospects for a phase-one agreement with China.  But, given the ups and downs of the trade dispute and that, you know, several truces and tentative deals have fallen through, are you concerned about developing monetary policy guidance, if you will, that’s dependent a good part on the wins of the trade negotiations? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, I know, that’s—I wouldn’t—that’s not how I would characterize it.  I would just—I noted that it may be that there’s been progress there toward— October 30, 2019  away from bad outcomes and confrontational outcomes, and it seems like there’s the makings of   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   a possible settlement there.  I didn’t say we’re baking that in or anything, but I’m just noting that that’s the case.  As with Brexit—it’s still quite uncertain what will be the result of the election and what the ultimate result will be.  But I would say that the tail risk of a nonnegotiated no-deal Brexit seems to have decreased, just as I would say that the situation in our trade negotiations with China seems to have taken a step closer to resolution.  That’s all I’m saying. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  If I could follow up, if the phase-one agreement, then, doesn’t work out, then would we be back at, you know, making, you know, monetary policy that— 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  That’s one factor among many, many factors that factor into our assessment of the outlook.  And if we see—if we have—if we—if things happen that cause us to materially reassess the outlook, change our assessment of the outlook in a material way, then we would act accordingly. 

[SECTION]

VIRGINIE MONTET.  Virginie Montet with the Agence France-Presse.  Thank you.  The Fed has pointed out many times in the past the rising inequality over those past decades and how that could be a factor behind sluggish growth.  In light of the recent outcome of the strike at General Motors, do you see the union having a role to play, helping to raise lower and middle incomes and promoting more shared growth in the long run? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, not for us to say what the appropriate labor arrangements will be.  I will just say, on the General Motors strike, it’s—it’s likely to have taken away a couple of tenths of growth this quarter.  That’s likely to come back, maybe, over the first half of next year.  And I think it’s good to see it settled.  But I’m not going to comment on what the appropriate labor arrangements are.  That’s a little bit far afield from our task here.  Thank you.  October 30, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL

PAUL KIERNAN.  Thank you, Chairman.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.  [Inaudible] Oh, I was wondering what that was.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.  Thank you—thank you, Chairman.  Wondering if you would categorize the current stance of monetary policy as accommodative, or if it’s just, you know, that neutral was lower than we thought at this time last year.  Secondly, you know, we’re now two years removed from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the economy is growing at about the same pace it was before—2 percent.  So, given your mention of fiscal policy and the role it plays in supporting long-term growth, you know, is it fair to say that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act worked the way it was supposed to?  Thanks. can’t—  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sorry, say again what your first question was?  I wrote it down, I 

[SECTION]

PAUL KIERNAN.  Sorry—if policy is accommodative right now. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Ah, yes.  Okay.  So if you look at where the federal funds rate is trading, it should be in the middle of, or maybe the lower half of, the range of 150 to 175.  So that means the real rate is probably modestly below zero.  I think my own sense would be that that’s somewhat accommodative policy.  I would say, though, that there’s a range of plausible estimates of what the neutral rate of interest is, and I think many of those who make such estimates have moved their estimate down over the course of many years, and that process continues.  But, nonetheless, that seems to me to be very likely to be an accommodative stance of policy, and an appropriate stance, given the situation we’re in with continuing downside risks and—that I mentioned.  So— 

[SECTION]

JEAN YUNG.  Hi.  Jean Yung from Market News.  I wanted to ask about financial stability risks.  Recently, the IMF and some other global policymakers have been expressing  October 30, 2019  concerns over the high level of risky corporate debt.  So as rates get lower in the U.S. and around   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   the world, are you more worried about financial stability risks and reach-for-yield? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we monitor financial stability risks very carefully all of the time.  It’s what we do since the financial crisis, as I’ve mentioned before.  Currently, we don’t see large imbalances.  This long expansion is notable for the lack of large financial imbalances like the ones we’ve seen certainly before the crisis happened. So we have a four-part framework, I’ll quickly mention.  The first is leverage in the financial system, which is low by historical standards.  The second is funding risk, which is the risk of runnable funding, and that risk is also quite low for banks but also for, you know, the nonbanking financial sector.  If you look at asset prices, we see some high asset prices but not broadly across a range.  We don’t see bubbles and that kind of thing.  And that leaves the fourth, which is leverage in the nonfinancial sector, and that’s households and businesses.  So with households, again, we don’t see leverage.  We see them actually getting in very good shape financially in the aggregate.  Obviously, plenty of households are not in great shape financially, but in the aggregate, the household sector is in a very good place.  That leaves businesses, which is where the issue has been.  Leverage among corporations and other forms of business, private businesses, is historically high.  We’ve been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate steps. So that’s what I would say, but it’s—corporate debt is one part of a larger part of our framework, and it is something that we’re paying quite a bit of attention to.  And it’s been part of the last couple of Shared National Credit exams, and we’ve been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate action.  October 30, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Hi.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Have the problems in the repo market led you to look into whether the liquidity and capital requirements for banks are too high?  Is that something that the Fed might review? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we’re—I think, again, I think the most important basic thing is to get the level of reserves back up so that—reserves move up and down with some volatility.  We don’t want them to move below the level they were at in the beginning of September, which is, again, between $1.45 and $1.5 trillion.  That’s the main thing, that’s the first thing.  And we’re on a path to do that, between our temporary open market operations and also our bill purchases. In addition to that—in addition to that, we’re looking at—there are—it’s a big, complicated marketplace, and there was the—one of the surprises, as I mentioned, was that banks that had told us that their lowest comfortable level of reserves was here.  They were well above that, and yet they didn’t deploy that liquidity when there seemed to be great opportunities to do that.  That didn’t happen.  So why is that?  And so, we’re doing careful analysis of that. You ask, would we lower capital and liquidity requirements because of this?  I don’t think so.  I don’t think that’s where this goes.  I think where it may go, though, is to look at, for example, intraday liquidity, which used to be a common thing.  It used to be a common thing for banks to have intraday liquidity from the Fed, what are called “daylight overdrafts.”  That’s something we can look at.  Also, there are just a few technical things that we can look at that would perhaps make the liquidity that we have—which we think is ample in the financial system—move more freely and be more liquid, if you will.  And those are things we would do, but only if we can do it without compromising safety or soundness or financial stability. 

[SECTION]

NAOATSU AOYAMA.  Thank you very much, Chairman Powell.  Naoatsu Aoyama from the Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper.  Given this sustained level of low inflation, even  October 30, 2019  in—even in this country, do you think—so there seems to be a higher possibility that lower   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL inflation expectations will remain going forward.  So do you think a Japan-like situation, or “Japanification” of chronically low inflation and interest rates—the U.S. is getting trapped by the Japanification of this situation?  Do you think so? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we—we, of course, have watched the situation in Japan and now the situation in Europe, and we—we note that there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world.  And we don’t think we’re exempt from those.  But, of course, if you look at our current inflation performance, it hasn’t been anything like what we’ve seen in those other places.  But we don’t think—again, we don’t think we’re exempt from those pressures, and we are, therefore, strongly committed to having inflation expectations anchored at the level that is consistent with the symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  That’s what we’re committed to, and we’ll use our tools to achieve.  So we take—we take the risk very seriously. It’s not—the risk isn’t that inflation might run a couple tenths below 2 percent.  The risk is that what we’ve seen is other economies getting on a disinflationary path, that it’s been very hard for them to get off.  Once inflation expectations start sliding down, inflation moves down.  You have less—interest rates move down as well, because there’s an inflation component in interest rates.  And, you know, we think that the right thing to do is to do what we can now to hold and really move inflation expectations up so that they’re squarely and firmly anchored at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation. 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi.  Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  Another type of balance sheet question, but not necessarily focused on the repo crunch—there was a discussion before that, that maybe we should move—or, rather, the Fed should move to a more neutral balance sheet, trying to remove some of the agency mortgage-backed securities that are on the balance  October 30, 2019  sheet and maybe replace them with shorter-term Treasuries.  Not any—I haven’t really heard an   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   update on the composure or the composition of the balance sheet for right now.  I’m just wondering if the Fed is actively thinking about that right now, and, if so, when we might expect to hear something on that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, it’s a—it’s an issue, but it’s not an issue that we’re currently working on and—or reaching a decision on or anything like that.  The question of the longer-run maturity composition of the balance sheet is a—is a big one, and it’s one we’ll return to over time, but not—not imminently.

VIVIENNE NUNIS.  Chairman Powell, this morning, the President tweeted that we’re seeing the greatest economy in American history.  I just wondered, as the Chair of America’s central bank, what you made of that characterization.

CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks very much.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
31,2019-12-11,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon, everyone.  To begin, I’d like to say a few words about Paul Volcker, who, as you know, passed away earlier this week.  Paul Volcker served as Federal Reserve Chair from 1979 to 1987.  He accomplished many things during his long and distinguished career at the Fed and elsewhere.  Of course, he’s best known for leading the fight to tame the double-digit inflation that he inherited as Chair, thus laying the foundation for the prosperity and price stability we enjoy today.  But what is perhaps most admirable about him—more than his many accomplishments—was his character.  He believed that there is no higher calling than public service, and he dedicated the lion’s share of his life to it.  With courage, integrity, and tenacity, he always pursued the policies that he believed would ultimately benefit all Americans.  My colleagues and I continue to draw inspiration from his example. Turning to today’s meeting, my colleagues and I decided to leave our policy rate unchanged after lowering it a total of ¾ percentage point at the previous three meetings.  As always, we base our decisions on judgment of how best to achieve the goals Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability.  Our economic outlook remains a favorable one despite global developments and ongoing risks.  With our decisions through the course of the past year, we believe that monetary policy is well positioned to serve the American people by supporting continued economic growth, a strong job market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent goal. The economic expansion is in its 11th year, the longest on record.  Household spending has been strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence.  In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the past year.  As has been the case for some time, sluggish growth  December 11, 2019  abroad and trade developments have been weighing on those sectors.  Even so, the overall   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL economy has been growing moderately.  And with a strong household sector and supportive monetary and financial conditions, we expect moderate growth to continue.  As seen from FOMC participants’ most recent projections, the median expectation for real GDP growth slows slightly over the next few years but remains near 2 percent. The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for well more than a year, and the pace of job gains remains solid.  Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years, ages 25 through 54, has been increasing.  And wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs.  People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now finding new opportunities.  Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of education.  These developments underscore for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.  We expect the job remains below 4 percent over the next several years. Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.  Over the 12 months through October, total PCE inflation was 1.3 percent, and core inflation—which excludes volatile food and energy prices and is a better indicator of future inflation—was 1.6 percent.  While low and stable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our objective can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which longer-term inflation expectations drift down, pulling actual inflation even lower.  In turn, interest rates would be lower as well and closer to their effective lower bound.  As a result, the scope for interest rate reductions to support the economy in a future downturn would be diminished, resulting in worse economic outcomes  December 11, 2019  for American families and businesses.  Against the backdrop of a strong economy and supportive   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent.  The median of participants’ projection rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2021.  We’re strongly committed to achieving our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal. Over the course of the past year, our views about the path of interest rates that would best achieve our employment and inflation objectives changed significantly, as the economy faced some important challenges from weaker global growth and trade developments.  As the year progressed, we adjusted the stance of monetary policy to cushion the economy from these developments and to provide some insurance against the associated risks.  In addition, inflation pressures were unexpectedly muted, strengthening the case for a more supportive stance of policy.  Rather than modestly increasing the target rate for the federal funds rate this year, as seemed appropriate a year ago, we reduced it by ¾ percentage point.  This shift has helped support the economy and has kept the outlook on track.  The medians of participants’ projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation are little changed from a year ago, aside from a lower inflation projection for 2019.  Of course, that is the function of monetary policy—to adjust interest rates to promote employment and price stability in response to forces acting on the economy. We believe that the current stance of monetary policy will support sustained growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective.  As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy likely will remain appropriate.  Looking ahead, we will be monitoring the effects of our recent policy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate.  Of course, if  December 11, 2019  developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL accordingly.  Policy is not on a preset course. Finally, I wanted to note that we’ve been purchasing Treasury bills and conducting repurchase operations, consistent with the plan we announced in December.1  These technical operations are aimed at maintaining an ample level of reserves and addressing money market pressures that could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy.  Our operations have gone well so far; pressures in money markets over recent weeks have been subdued.  To address possible pressures in money markets over the year-end, we’ve been conducting term repo operations spanning year-end.  We stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as appropriate to keep the federal funds rate in the target range.  Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions.

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  [Inaudible remark]  Sorry—Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Sorry about that.  So I was struck by the, sort of, disconnect that exists here between the behavior of unemployment and inflation.  You seem to have unemployment penciled in here now for three years running—more—underneath the longer-run level, yet inflation never really accelerates.  So what are we to make of that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, that’s—what’s happening there is the fact that the relationship between resource utilization, or unemployment, and inflation has just gotten weaker and weaker over the years.  If you go back 50 years, you would have seen that, when there was—when labor got control of inflation, the connection got weaker and weaker and weaker, to the point where there’s still a connection, but it’s—it’s a very faint one.  And I—what that suggests is that you                                                  1 Chair Powell intended to say the repurchase operations were announced in October.  December 11, 2019  would need to keep policy somewhat accommodative.  And we believe that policy is somewhat   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   accommodative, and we think that that’s the appropriate place for policy to be in order to drive up inflation. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  If I could follow up on that—I mean, it’s faint to nonexistent, though, it seems to me, so this suggests that, really, your policy lever as it exists now isn’t really influencing prices at all.  So, in that case, what do you do to reach your target? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I don’t think that’s right.  I mean, we—the—again, the relationship between slack in the economy and inflation is weak, has been weak.  The coefficient is something like 0.1.  So it’s much, much lower than it used to be, but I don’t know that it’s gone down any more in the last decade.  It just is quite faint.  But it’s still there.  I mean, you can see it.  If you look—look at where wages were three or four years ago, they were running around 2 percent.  And now the whole group of different wage measures that we monitor has moved up to 3 and 3½ percent, and that suggests tightening.  The same thing is true, but much less true, of inflation, the relationship between—in a way, the wage Phillips curve has a higher coefficient than the price Phillips curve does.  But we do still see some relationship, and that’s what you’re seeing in those numbers. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman CNBC.  You’ve used the analogy to 1998 to describe the rate cuts we just went through, and I’m wondering if we can sort of continue the analogy.  Within seven months of those ’98 rate cuts, the Fed took them back and then some.  So, were these those kind of rate cuts, the kind that you need to take back, or are we at a place now where we’re at a neutral rate—“take back,” I mean if those risks that you say we’re cushioning from don’t materialize in the way you think—or is this now a new sort of steady state  December 11, 2019  for the economy at this rate, this is the right rate for the economy that you see going forward and   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   don’t need to take those rate cuts back? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So there’s similarities, conceptual similarities, I think, between the two instances during that long expansion, I guess in ’95 and ’98, when the Fed cut three times only to resume raising rates.  And the notion just is that it’s a—the economy needed slightly more accommodative policy, but it wasn’t the end of the expansion, right?  And that’s the same situation we believe we’re in here.  So this is that we did, in fact, turn out to do three rate cuts.  That wasn’t in the plan, you know, in any kind of specific way at the beginning.  So that’s the same. What’s different is, you have a very different—you have very different structural characteristics in the economy, particularly around inflation.  So now, as you can see, inflation is barely moving up, notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50-year lows and expected to remain there.  So the need for rate increases is less.  And, by the way, this is—it’s a good thing that, you know, we think we can—I think we’ve learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation.  In fact, we need some upward pressure on inflation to get back to 2 percent.  It’s quite different in ’95 and ’98 when there were those two adjustments.  So, I would say, similarities and differences.

MICHAEL MCKEE.  The BIS concluded in—I did the same thing as Howard.  Michael McKee, Bloomberg radio and television.  The BIS concluded in September that the repo spike was not a one-off confluence of random events but reflected structural and regulatory issues that could lead to a recurrence.  I’d like to ask you if you agree with the BIS findings. And, given that we’re approaching year-end for the markets, will you be taking any extra steps to ensure that funding is available in the repo and FX swaps markets?  There was a report  December 11, 2019  yesterday from Credit Suisse suggesting there’s a good chance that we will see disruptions, and   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   one of the reasons they put for it is that the Fed is at this point buying only T-bills, and the 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I’m going to take a little step back, and I will—I will get to your specific questions on the year-end and on T-bills.  So I guess I want to start by stressing that these are very important operational matters but that are not likely to have any macroeconomic implications.  We’d decided back in January to remain an ample-reserves regime, and that means we will be setting the federal funds rate—the range for the federal funds rate through our administered rates and not through active management of the level of reserves.  We’re committed to robustly implementing that framework, as you can see by our actions.  And the purpose of all this, let’s remember, is to assure that our monetary policy decisions will be transmitted to the federal funds rate, which in turn affects other short-term rates.  We have the tools to accomplish that, and we will use them.  The purpose of all this is not to eliminate all volatility, particularly in the repo market. So, taking you back, this—as you know, we had very gradually allowed the balance sheet to shrink, we slowed that gradual pace by half in March, and then we ended it in July.  Meanwhile, we had surveyed all of the banks, and particularly the large banks who hold a lot of the reserves, and said, “What’s your lowest comfortable level of reserves?”  We got those numbers, we added them up, we added a buffer, and it came out sort of at a level that was well below where we were in September.  And yet we saw, actually, in September that reserves—the So what had happened was that liquidity, which actually existed, didn’t flow into the repo  December 11, 2019  And we’ve been very carefully looking at the reasons why that might have happened.  There   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL are—there are payments issues, there have been a number of supervisory and regulatory issues raised—we’re looking carefully at those.  We’re open to ideas for modifying supervisory and regulatory practice in ways that don’t undermine safety and soundness, and a number of ideas are under—under examination there.  To go through it sort of by—in time, we started off, really, on plan.  That plan is in effect.  It’s working.  I think, for the last couple of months, repo markets have been functioning well, short-term rates are stable, markets are functioning. So you asked about year-end.  Temporary upward pressures on short-term money market rates are not unusual around year-end.  And our—both our repo operations and Treasury bill purchases are intended to mitigate the risks that such pressures pose to our control of the federal funds rate.  We think that the pressures appear manageable, and we stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as necessary to keep the federal funds rate in the target range.  Our strategy has been—essentially, the key to our strategy is to supply reserves in the near term through—through both overnight and term repo, and, at the same time, we’re raising the underlying level of reserves through bill purchases.  I’ll take that now. We’ve said bills—bill purchases.  We’ve also said that we were willing to adapt our strategy.  We’re not at this place, but if it does become appropriate for us to purchase other short-term coupon securities, then we would be prepared to do that if—if the need arises.  So—but we don’t—we don’t—we’re not in that place.  It looks—it very much looks like the bill—so those bill purchases are going well, just according to expectations.  I mean, the other thing I’ll say is that we’re in, you know, very regular contact with market participants all the time.  We’ll be  December 11, 2019  providing—we’ll be continuing that, and we’re prepared to adjust our tactics.  We’re—we’re   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL focused on—on year-end as well and prepared to adjust our operations as appropriate. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  The follow-up to that would be, where are we with the possibility of a standing repo facility? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, on the standing repo facility, as you know, we’ve actually had a couple of meetings where we’ve discussed that.  I think the standing repo facility is something that’ll take some time to evaluate and create the parameters of and put into place.  At the moment what we’re focused on is, you know—we’re now focused on year-end.  I should also mention that after the year-end, the sense of it is that as the underlying level of reserves moves up because of bill purchases, as that happens, there will come a time when it will be appropriate for overnight and term repo to gradually decline.  We don’t know—we can’t know today what the timing of that will be, but that’s the way—that’s the way we see it going over time. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long from the Washington Post.  A number of your colleagues have said explicitly that they do not think the FOMC should raise interest rates until core inflation is back at 2 percent.  They think there should be a rule.  Where do you personally stand on that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, as I mentioned, actually, at the last press conference, we think our policy rate is appropriate and will remain appropriate as long as incoming data are broadly in keeping with our—with our outlook.  And in order to move rates up, I would want to see inflation that’s persistent and that’s significant—a significant move-up in inflation that’s also persistent before raising rates to address inflation concerns.  That’s my view. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  So is this de facto policy of the Committee then?  I guess I’m wondering why it’s not sort of codified in a statement.  December 11, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We haven’t—we haven’t tried to turn it into some sort of, you know, official forward guidance.  It happens to be my view that that’s what it would take to want to move interest rates up in order to deal with inflation. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.  Just following up on Heather’s question—so if you look at the SEP today, it looks like inflation is never overshooting 2 percent and is only getting up to 2 percent by the end of 2021, yet rates are increasing in 2021.  So, I guess, how do we square that circle, with interest rates increasing before inflation ever really moves up in some meaningful overshooting way? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I think what you’re seeing is, you’ve got a full year of the median being flat, which is, we think, accommodative, modestly accommodative, and inflation not moving up very much, as we’ve discussed.  And that underscores, I think, the challenge of getting inflation to move up.  The Committee has wanted inflation to be at 2 percent, squarely at 2 percent, for—ever since I arrived in 2012.  And it hasn’t happened, and it’s just—it’s because there are disinflationary forces around the world, and they’ve been stronger than, I think, people understood them to be. In terms of those out-year rate increases, what’s you’re—you’re looking at rate increases more than a year into the future, and, you know, people will have their own explanations for why they do that, but we—really, none of us have much of a sense of what the economy will be like in 2021.  So I think what may be behind some of that is just the thought that, over time, it would be appropriate—if you believe that the neutral rate is 2½ percent, it would be appropriate for your rates to move up in that direction.  I will also say to you that a number of people wrote down, and you can’t see this at this level of detail, but—today—but a number of people did write down overshoots of inflation as appropriate—under appropriate policy.  December 11, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

BRENDAN GREELEY.  Brendan Greeley from the Financial Times.  Given that inflation—whichever measure you choose—has either sort of remained where it is or not increased over the past year as you’ve been dropping the policy rate, what is it that gives you confidence that the Fed has the tools to get inflation back up to target or even overshoot as you just indicated that some people are considering doing? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, it’s just that there is still, empirically, by many, many different—by the work of many different analysts, there is a relationship between resource utilization, by which I mean unemployment, and inflation.  It’s just relatively weak.  And, by the way, that’s not a bad thing.  That means that we can run at low levels of unemployment and have a historically good—in some dimensions—labor market without having to worry about inflation.  It also means, though, that it’s not easy to move inflation up. Now, you say, why is there confidence?  I mean, I would say there’s more humility than there is confidence in this at this point.  It’s been very challenging to get inflation to be at target.  If you look around the world, the United States, of all major economies, has been closest to it but still hasn’t quite been able to achieve it.  And I would also point out that this year, which has been a good year for the economy, inflation—core inflation is actually running at 1.6 percent, whereas it ran close to 2 percent most of last year.  So it’s—it’s a real challenge, and—but I think we’re using our tools as best we can to meet that challenge. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.  So, Chair Powell, I want to ask about the framework review, which obviously entails some kind of debate around allowing an overshoot of the 2 percent target.  And in that—in that context, is merely saying that you want inflation to rise above 2 percent a sufficient strategy for getting inflation to stay at the target, or would it compel some kind of policy action beyond deferring future rate increases to achieve that  December 11, 2019  outcome if that’s the direction in which the Committee goes?  In other words, it’s one thing to   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL accept inflation rising on its own opportunistically.  But if inflation does not materialize, would a change in the framework necessarily make it easier to generate higher inflation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I—you know, I think the answer to the question of whether saying it is enough to create credibility, the answer to that is “no.”  And I think you have to back that up with policy that supports the outcome, and that’s what we’re trying to do.  And so the—the changes that we’re looking at to the framework are—I think they take all of that on board, and—but they’re—what they’re—what they are designed to do is to strengthen the credibility of that—of that inflation target, but only if followed by policy.  Ultimately, it will take time to establish—to move inflation expectations up from where they are, which appears to be a bit below 2 percent, will not happen overnight.  It’ll have to happen over time as credibility is built.  You know, the Fed has great inflation credibility, but inflation expectations are anchored at about their 25-year average, which is a few ticks below 2 percent. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  We talked a lot about inflation—Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.  We talked a lot about inflation.  I want to ask you about uncertainty.  With the House announcing that they will ratify USMCA and Canada and Mexico signing off on it, do you see that uncertainty easing now so the business investment could pick up, or are the trade tensions with China just that big elephant in the room where you might not see those business investments pick up? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I did see the news today that it appears there’s an agreement to move forward to vote on USMCA, and, of course, it’s not our role to comment on particular trade policies or criticize them one way or the other or evaluate them.  I will say, though, that getting—if the deal were to be enacted, then it would certainly remove some of the trade policy  December 11, 2019  uncertainty, and that would be, I believe, a positive for the economy.  And I’ll say the same thing   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   about the negotiations with China, which haven’t reached that point yet. We’ve been hearing from our people that we talked to—the many, many people and businesses that we talked to in—through the Reserve Banks that wind up being written up in the Beige Book, and they’ve been telling us all year—for a year and a half, really, that trade policy uncertainty is weighing on the outlook.  And I do think that, again, without commenting on it—in any way on the process or the content of the agreement, I think that uncertainty—removal of uncertainty around that would be a positive for the economy as well. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Is one uncertainty bigger than the other?  Is—do you see—not commenting on the deals themselves, is one uncertainty— 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think you can—you know, it’s—I think you can see that what’s been moving—one way to look at it is, what’s been moving financial markets?  It’s been news about the negotiations with China, not so much USMCA.  I think the difference between NAFTA and USMCA is—is smaller than the difference between current, you know, arrangements with China and what’s being negotiated. 

[SECTION]

MATTHEW BOESLER.  Hi, Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg.  Chair Powell, the Fed policy review this year has largely been discussed in terms of the inflation side of the mandate and the need to shore up inflation expectations.  But it seems like the message you’ve been getting from the Fed Listens events and also something else you’ve recently acknowledged is that, you know, the Fed has also been systematically overestimating labor utilization throughout this expansion.  So I’m wondering if you could talk a little bit about the extent to which the review is looking at the employment side of the mandate as well.  Are there any possibilities, you  December 11, 2019  know, for perhaps systematizing a more asymmetric reaction function with regard to   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL unemployment?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So the—you know, the focus really is on how to use our strategies, tools, and communications to achieve both sides of the mandate.  And you’re right, though, that we’ve talked here a lot about inflation.  And I think that the—I think, more broadly, over a period of years—many years—we’ve been learning that the natural rate of unemployment is lower.  It’s just been—it’s in estimates not just at the Fed, but among—broadly among economists—labor economists have seen that the connection—that we can sustain much lower levels of unemployment than had been thought.  And, as I mentioned, that’s a good thing because that means we—we don’t have to worry so much about inflation.  And that’s—and you see the benefits of that in today’s labor market. I—you know, the Fed Listens events are about inflation to a much lesser extent than they are about maximum employment.  If you’ve—if you’ve listened to or attended any of those, the discussion—we always focus on inflation as well, but the discussion is really around what’s happening in low- and moderate-income communities and among small businesses.  And I think you—you get a perspective, which—you know, we were already getting that from our extensive outreach to community groups and such.  But it was help to get—helpful to get it in the context of a monetary policy review.  And I think that the fact that these communities have so much—such high levels of unemployment and low levels of labor force participation tells you that there is slack out there.  And I think that does also inform our understanding of what we mean by “maximum employment.” And it’s been a very positive—I would say that the Fed Listens events have been—have been extraordinarily positive, and they’re certainly something we’ll repeat.  You also see from  December 11, 2019  the business perspective that companies are taking all kinds of measures to—you know, to look   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   through things on people’s résumés that would have perhaps disqualified them in other kinds of environments, training is moving up—you hear just a lot—there are a lot of things going on that suggest that people at the margins of the labor force are being pulled in and being given chances, which is a great thing. 

[SECTION]

MATTHEW BOESLER.  Thanks.  Sorry, if I could just follow up briefly—is there any way to sort of systematize these insights, do you think, with, you know, in terms of—we talk a lot about, for example, makeup strategies on the inflation side.  Is there anything similar you could do on the employment side? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I—I think we have kind of internalized—and this isn’t—this isn’t news for today, this is something we’ve been saying for, you know, for several years—you’ve seen us moving down our estimates of the—of maximum employment.  In fact, it’s already—it’s already understood, I think, that—that there’s more—even though we’re at 3½ percent unemployment, there’s actually more slack out there, in a sense.  And—and the risks of, you know, using accommodative monetary policy, our tool, to explore that are relatively low.  And I think we know that, and I think the review certainly underscores that, but that’s—that’s a very important insight. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.  I wanted to ask more about the—the repo issues and what you all are doing beyond open market operations.  Are you currently, for example, telling examiners not to prefer reserves over Treasuries for supervisory purposes?  Are you talking to the Treasury Department about maybe reducing the level of volatility in their account at the Fed?  And on the standing repo facility, is it, you know, that you would be  December 11, 2019  inclined to do it, but you need to figure out the details?  Or—or what would kind of drive the   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, on Treasuries versus reserves, we’ve done a ton of work on that.  We’ve talked to supervisors, and—it’s interesting, if you look at the banks, they’re all over the place on the composition of their—of their buffer.  So you have to have—you have a business model, and that business model suggests what your stress outflows will be, and that suggests what your buffer should be.  And you see them making quite different choices.  Some of them have lots of reserves and, you know, fewer Treasuries, and then they change their mind and they switch, so it’s not obvious that there’s one thing happening there.  Notwithstanding that, we have—we’ve gone out to try to understand that, talking to supervisors. In terms of the—the TGA, you know, we have not tried to pull the TGA into this yet; we’ve taken it as exogenous.  I don’t know that at some point we won’t have those discussions, but, you know, Treasury—we want Treasury to be able to have the cash that it needs.  And then we should—we are essentially taking that as exogenous to our—to our work.  And, you know, there may come a time when we—when we talk about that, but we haven’t done much of that. Standing repo facility—so your question on that is, what are we thinking about it?  What are we—I mean, I—so I think we’re—we are more focused, frankly, on the T—the bill purchases, the year-end, and also the review of supervisory and regulatory issues that we’re digging into, and—because we think, you know, there’s—these are structural things—right?—where you could, without sacrificing safety and soundness, just allow the—allow the liquidity that is already there to flow more freely, perhaps by making fairly straightforward, noncontroversial changes.  And we think there is some of that, though—and so we’re working hard and fast.  But those are things, you know, the—if they take rule changes, it’ll take, you  December 11, 2019  know, a notice of public rulemaking—it’ll take three months and things like that.  Those things   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL take time.  These things that we’re working on now, though—like, you know, going through year-end with the overnight facilities and the bill purchases and the term repo—those are—those are things we have to do right now and are doing. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  I wanted to ask, the only change in the statement was a drop in the reference to uncertainties around the economy.  You seem very confident that—or it implies there’s a lot of confidence that those uncertainties have gone away.  What caused you to make that change for the statement?  What were you looking at that seemed to be so much lower? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, we did, actually—if you look at the statement, you’ll notice that we—we did call out global developments and muted inflation pressures later in the statement.  And why did we do that?  You know, those are the things that we’ve been monitoring all year.  We’ve put now in place policies that we think are appropriate to address those things, so we’re not revisiting that.  But those are—those are just key things, and they haven’t gone away, so we thought it was appropriate to mention them there—still subject to the idea that, for us to change our stance, we would want to see a material reassessment of the outlook. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Well, just to follow real quick, on the material—material reassessment aspect, are you worried that that has set too high a bar for potential cuts next year?  We were talking about rate hikes, but no—no Fed policymaker seems to foresee any cuts next year.  Some economists do.  Does a material reassessment mean you need to see data actually worsen?  Does it reduce your ability to act preemptively the way, arguably, you did this year? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, I mean, one thing that we’re mindful of is that we’ve cut rates three times since July.  That’s 75 basis points’ worth of cuts.  And we do believe that monetary  December 11, 2019  policy operates with long and variable lags, and that it will take some time before the full effects   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   of those actions are seen in the economy.  So that’ll take some time.  So that’s one reason to hold back and—and wait.  And we thought—I think we took strong measures.  In fact, if you look at—more broadly at the Treasury yield curve, it has moved more than 75 basis points.  So you’ve—you’ve had quite a significant move in the direction of higher accommodation. In terms of what’s—you know, what is material at the end of the day, well, I would just say, whether or not a change in the outlook merits a policy response will be a collective judgment of the FOMC.  There isn’t any single factor that will determine our decisions.  We’ll—we’ll look at a full range of data and other information bearing on the economic outlook. 

[SECTION]

SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thank you Mr. Chairman, Scott Horsley for NPR.  You started out by talking about Paul Volcker, who obviously cast a—a long shadow.  I wonder if, in hindsight, that shadow was—was too long, and if—in the decades since his tenure and, in particular, last year, if the Fed was too quick to raise interest rates to attack an inflation bogeyman that didn’t materialize. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I—this wouldn’t be a—my response will not be about Paul Volcker, but—so, well, you started with Paul Volcker.  So, if you look back at 2018—I’ll just take you back to the beginning of 2018.  We had an economy growing at 3 percent, we had inflation at 2 percent, and we had a trillion and a half dollars’ worth of stimulus arriving, and the federal funds rate was 1.4 percent.  So it wasn’t that—so we moved—we moved policy up during the course of the year.  We never got policy even at the level of what we thought the neutral rate was at the time.  So there was no sense of it being restrictive.  We took steps to make it less accommodative, and that seemed to be the right thing.  It still seems to me to be the right thing in hindsight.  The idea that we were trying to, you know, slow the economy down—we  December 11, 2019  were really just trying to get near neutral.  And even with the last rate increase a year ago, we   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL were still meaningfully below the median estimate on the Committee of what the neutral rate was.  So policy was always accommodative during the course of that year. I think what’s happened is, the—obviously, the facts on the ground have changed.  You saw the global economic slowdown begin in the middle of last year, gather force, and then continue to go on this year, so you’ve seen a continual weakening.  Just look at the IMF’s forecasts of growth from, you know, the spring of 2018 and compare them to now.  You’ve had quite a significant—that does affect us.  I think, also, the trade situation was just beginning in the middle of ’18, and I think it had—has had—you know, I think there’ll be a very, very wide range of estimates of the effect, but I think it’s had a meaningful effect on output just through the uncertainty channel and, to a lesser extent, through—through, you know, the tariff effects.  And, again, that’s not to make a judgment.  It’s not up to us to make a judgment about that.  So, that’s what—that would be my story.

DONNA BORAK.  Chair Powell, Donna Borak with CNN.  To follow up on Edward’s trade question, could you talk about what you would imagine the economic effect would be if negotiations with China were to fall apart and how the Fed might be able to support the economy in that event? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I wouldn’t want to speculate on—on a hypothetical.  I would say—we’ll just have to see.  We’re—we look at a range of factors and we’ve—as I’ve said before, we try to look through the volatility in trade news and trade negotiations.  We try not to react.  We can’t react.  Monetary policy is not the right tool to react in the very short term to volatility and, you know, things that can change back and forth and back and forth as this has  December 11, 2019  happened, as is probably typical of a—of a large complex negotiation.  So, in terms of—you   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL know, I—again, I don’t want to get into hypothetical outcomes, though, if that’s all right. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  I’m just wondering, you met with the President last month.  Did you have any advice for him when it came to this, and did you express some concerns about the potential volatility and the impact of the economy on—given all this? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I—I’m going to stick with my and my predecessors’ longtime practice of not discussing private meetings with elected officials—or other officials, really.  But thank you. 

[SECTION]

VIRGINIE MONTET.  Thank you.  Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse.  Yesterday, Democratic leaders in the House have launched an impeachment process against the President.  Have you mentioned these developments within the Committee, as—today as potentially presenting some risks for their confidence in the economy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  No.  We have not.  We don’t consider things like that. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Mike Derby with Dow Jones Newswires.  Does the Fed’s dot plot still serve a useful communications purpose, or do you feel that it might be time to retire it or change it in some fashion? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  With—I think properly understood, it can be useful, but that’s been a challenge.  You know, I think “properly understood” to me means looking at what it is and not at what it isn’t.  And what it is is, it’s an expression of the thinking about individual Committee members about appropriate monetary policy and the path of the economy.  Remember that we write all that down, and we send it in, and it gets compiled.  But we don’t discuss it at the meeting, and we don’t negotiate a plan.  There is no—there’s no agreement.  There’s no plan.  December 11, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL And I think, particularly at inflection points, it’s hard to convey the reality, which is that policy is always going to depend on the economic outlook and changes in the economic outlook.  And when the economic outlook is changing, the dots are—they’re just not a consideration.  We’re going to do what we think is the right thing for the economy.  And if the fact—dots that we did six months ago or three months ago don’t agree with that, that’s not even in the conversation.  So its more—but it can it be useful if—and I think—but, as I said, it’s been a challenge, and so I—I do—I do like to say, if you focus too much on the dots, you can—you can miss the broader picture. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Chairman Powell, many people seem worried that the framework that you guys are working on is going to be—the results are going to be less rather than more.  And I—people keep coming back and saying why—asking why you took off, like, a 4 percent inflation rate off the table even when it started.  I mean, as you said, going around the country for all the Listen events, I don’t think I heard anybody worry about a 4 percent inflation rate or think that a higher inflation rate was going to be a problem.  So where does that concern come from?  Is it members of Congress that have—have said this? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  No.  So let me say, we’re—we’ve been working on this all year.  And we’re just at the stage where we’ve had a really interesting discussion about the various tools that we have at the October meeting.  At this meeting, we talked about the way monetary policy affects different groups in the economy.  So we had a—we talked about the Fed Listens events and some very interesting research.  So we’re just getting to the stage where we’re looking at conclusions.  You know, what do we take away from all this?  And those things—many of those things would wind up as changes, if you will, modifications to the “Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”  I think that process will take until the middle  December 11, 2019  of the year where—but we want to approach it very thoroughly and very carefully.  And that is—  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   in effect, that is our framework document.  And I wouldn’t prejudge.  No one—I believe we will be able to—to reach a successful conclusion and make meaningful improvements.  I do. In terms of “4 percent”—so that’s—I think it’s premature for people to be saying that this isn’t going anywhere.  You know—and if you define going anywhere as a 4 percent inflation target—let me talk about the 4 percent inflation target.  So I’ll go back to the point that just saying words is not itself credible.  So I think if you said, “We’re raising the inflation target to 4,” what would be the effect of that?  I mean, where’s the credibility in that, really?  You haven’t been able to get it to 2.  So I think we—I think you need to lower your sights a little bit.  I also think, is 4 percent—you’d have to ask the question, is that really, you know, price stability?  Is that really price stability?  Is that within our legal mandate?  I mean, I think it’s a fair question. So, you know, I think—I’d like for this review to come out with very—a set of positive results—you know, meaningful improvements.  It doesn’t mean it has to solve every problem going forward.  We want to—we want to have this be a successful exercise where we meaningfully improve our monetary policy framework.  These things don’t tend to move in—you know, in a lurchy way, they tend to evolve.  But I think—and if we do this, then in a few years, again and again and things like that, then we can—at least we’re moving in a good direction.  And I think we will be.  I’m confident we will be. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times.  Chair Powell, you’ve had a busy year, and I’m wondering, as you look back, what things you might have done differently.  And are there any lessons that you would take into next year? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, you know, I have to say, my total focus is on right now and getting policy right and thinking about next year—you know, thinking about what’s the economy  December 11, 2019  going to be doing.  I like where we are on policy, as I mentioned.  I think our policy stance is   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL appropriate and likely to remain so as long as the outlook is broadly like this.  You know—I mean, it’s too long of a question.  You know, I don’t know how to get after that.  There’s—there’s a lot of learning that comes into—from the economy every year and in the way we do our jobs.  And, you know, we’re always going to be trying to learn lessons. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  I mean, are there any particular surprises, whether it’s the economy or how 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I—so, yes.  I didn’t—obviously, you know, didn’t see and I don’t think anybody saw coming the—the challenges that we faced this year.  I think they were a surprise.  I think that, toward the end of 2018, there was still a sense the economy was growing at around 3 percent.  And I didn’t expect the—to face the challenges, but I think we did face them, and I think we—I’m pleased that we moved to support the economy in the way that we did.  I think our moves will prove appropriate.  And, again, I think both the economy and monetary policy right now, I think, are in a good place. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  I’m Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace.  Chair Powell, why aren’t we seeing stronger wage gains?  Wages are growing more slowly now than they were toward the beginning of the year.  Why is that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, wage gains have moved up a bit.  If you look back three, four years, you’ll see wages are growing around 2 percent.  Now you see them moving up, you know, more at 3, 3½ percent.  So why aren’t they growing higher, at a faster rate?  And it’s a couple of things.  I think there are a range of explanations.  For instance, one would be that productivity has just been low.  So wages should go up to cover inflation and productivity.  Productivity has been low, and that—that is very likely to be holding back wages.  I also think there are other  December 11, 2019  possible potential explanations, such as, you know, globalization can be—the idea that you can   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL make, manufacture, or even provide services anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world.  I think that hangs over the wage-setting process—and everywhere, pretty much.  You don’t see—there isn’t the kind of traction in the wage market that—even in a tight labor market. Another thing is, though, that the labor market may not be as tight as we had thought it was.  And, you know, I think there—there are many, many possible explanations.  I will say, though, if you look, for example, at nonsupervisory employees in the labor report, there are—their wages are going up at 3.7 percent.  And so, you do see—and wages are going up the most for people at the lower end of the—that’s been true for the last couple of years—lower end of the wage spectrum.  So you do see wages moving up.  It’s just—they’re not moving up at—at very high rates.  And, again, at the end of the day, that probably has most to do with productivity. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Can I ask a quick follow-up?  Just as far as the market not being as tight as you thought, are you saying there are still more people on the sidelines who could join the labor force? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, yes.  And I would also say that we—if you ask people, and we did ask people, what do you think the natural rate of unemployment is?  People were writing down numbers in the fives, and then they were writing down numbers in the fours.  And now, unemployment has been in the threes for a year and a half, and we still see wage inflation, as you mentioned.  The level of wage inflation has actually moved down, although, there may be compositional effects in that number that may—that may be, to some extent, about younger workers coming in at lower wages that—than retiring workers. But you wouldn’t—that shouldn’t have much of an effect, actually.  So why is that?  It  December 11, 2019  seeing—really, it showed up through higher participation.  For many years, we’ve thought that   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL there’s a trend decline in participation.  Notwithstanding that, against that trend, we’ve seen prime-age participation moving up pretty steadily over the last two or three years.  And it’s a very positive thing, but it does sort of provide more labor supply, meaning a less tight labor without the Fed?

HANNAH LANG.  Hi.  Hannah Lang with American Banker.  Thanks for being here today.  I just wanted to ask about the Community Reinvestment Act, since the FDIC and OCC this might cause confusion, and how would the mechanics work if this proposal is finalized 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, we think the CRA—we know the CRA is a very important law, and we’re strongly committed to the mission of ensuring that banks provide credit to their—throughout their communities, particularly addressing the needs of low- and moderate-income households and neighborhoods.  We also think it’s time for modernization.  We’ve thought that for some time, and we worked very hard to try to get aligned with the OCC, really, on—on a proposal.  And my hope is that we can still do that.  You know, I don’t know whether that’ll be possible or not.  It will have to—well, we’ll just have to see, but—and if we—if we can’t, I don’t—I’m not sure what the path forward would be.  We would certainly not want to create confusion or, you know, sort of tension between the regimes if they do turn out to be slightly different regimes.  So that’s something we—I hope we don’t have to face, but we will if

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi there.  Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  So, before the July meeting, you said something kind of colorful.  You said, “To call something ‘hot,’ you would we have to.  December 11, 2019  need to see some heat,” referring to the labor market.  So to expand a bit, I guess, on Nancy’s   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL question, it seems like the wage Phillips curve has been pretty well explored already, but what would you need to see to call the labor market “hot” in that case?  Would it be a contract—or, rather, some sort of change in either the headline number of gains or in the unemployment rate? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Really, wages.  I mean, we—there’s so many other measures that suggest that the labor market is—I like to say the labor market is strong.  I don’t really want to say that it’s tight.  Someone asked me a question about a hot labor market—that was in the Humphrey-Hawkins hearings.  So I’ll say that the labor market is strong.  I don’t know that it’s tight, because you’re not seeing wage increases, you know.  Ultimately, if it’s tight, those should be—should be reflected in higher wage increases, so it does come down to that.  You know, we look at countless measures of labor market—you know, labor utilization, and there’s so many—it’s too many to count.  But the one that has—that is kind of suggesting that you’re—it’s a healthy number that, you know, the sort of 3.1 percent average hourly earnings number is a Ultimately, though, we’d like to see—to call it “hot,” you’d want to see heat.  You’d want to see, you know, higher wages.  Thanks.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
32,2020-01-29,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon, everyone.  Thanks for being here.  At today’s meeting, my colleagues and I decided to leave our policy rate unchanged.  As always, we base our decisions on our judgment of how best to achieve the goals Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability.  We believe monetary policy is well positioned to serve the American people by supporting continued economic growth, a strong job market, and a return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent goal. The expansion is in its 11th year, the longest on record.  Growth in household spending moderated toward the end of last year, but with a healthy job market, rising incomes, and upbeat consumer confidence, the fundamentals supporting household spending are solid.  In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the past year.  Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on activity in these sectors.  However, some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished recently, and there are some signs that global growth may be stabilizing after declining since mid-2018.  Nonetheless, uncertainties about the outlook remain, including those posed by the new coronavirus.  Overall, with monetary and financial conditions supportive, we expect moderate economic growth to continue. The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for well more than a year, and the pace of job gains remains solid.  Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years, ages 25 to 54, is at its highest level in more than a decade.  And wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs.  People who live and work in middle-income communities and low-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now finding new opportunities.  Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL ethnic groups and all levels of education.  These developments underscore for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind. Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.  Over the 12 months through November, total PCE inflation was 1.5 percent, and core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was 1.6 percent.  Available data suggest similar inflation readings for December, though we expect inflation to move closer to 2 percent over the next few months as unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out of the calculation.  While low and stable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our objective can lead longer-term inflation expectations to drift down, pulling actual inflation even lower.  In turn, interest rates would be lower as well—closer to their effective lower bound.  As a result, we would have less room to reduce interest rates to support the economy in a future downturn to the detriment of American families and businesses.  We have seen this dynamic play out in other economies around the world, and we are determined to avoid it here in the United States. In particular, we believe the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation returning to our 2 percent—symmetric 2 percent objective.  As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy likely will remain appropriate.  We will be monitoring the effects of the policy actions we took last year, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate.  Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.  Policy is not on a preset course. I will conclude with a brief overview of our current plans for our technical operations to implement monetary policy.  The plan the FOMC announced back in October to purchase  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL Treasury bills and conduct repo operations has proceeded smoothly and has succeeded in providing an ample supply of reserves to the banking system and effectively controlling the federal funds rate.  In light of the resulting stability in the federal funds rate and money market conditions more generally, we decided to make a small technical upward adjustment to administered rates to ensure that the federal funds rate trades well within the target range.  This action reverses the small downward adjustment made in September when money markets were volatile. As our bill purchases continue to build reserves toward levels that maintain ample conditions, the role played by active repo operations will naturally recede.  Over the first half of this year, we intend to adjust the size and pricing of repo operations as we transition away from their active use in supplying reserves.  This process will take place gradually, and, as indicated in today’s FOMC directive to the Desk, we expect to continue offering repos at least through April to ensure a consistently ample supply of reserves.  Based on current projections, we expect that the underlying level of reserves will durably reach ample levels sometime in the second quarter of this year.  As we get close to that point, we intend to slow the pace of purchases and transition to a program of smaller reserve management purchases that maintains an ample level of reserves without the active use of repos.  At that point, as in the pre-crisis period, our balance sheet will be expanding gradually over time, reflecting the trend growth in the demand for currency and other Federal Reserve liabilities. All of these technical measures are designed to support the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy and are not intended to represent a chance—a change in the stance of monetary policy.  We are committed to completing the transition to our longer-run ample-reserves regime smoothly and predictably.  Of course, we will continue to closely monitor  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL conditions in money markets, and we will adjust these plans as conditions warrant.  Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER CONDON.  Thank you.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Mr. Chairman, I would like you to comment in a little bit more depth about one small change I’ve noted in the statement.  It notes that policy will be appropriate to bring—the Committee believes—inflation back to the Committee’s 2 percent symmetric inflation objective.  That’s a slight change from the last time, when you were expecting it to bring inflation outcomes back near the objective.  And I would put this also in the context of a comment you made at the last press conference where you drew attention to the fact that a number of policymakers had projected inflation overshoots two or three years out under appropriate monetary policy.  Should we take all of this together to mean simply that the Committee is more confident that a 2 percent outcome for inflation is already baked in the cake, or that this is a signal that the Committee has a stronger resolution to bring inflation at least to the 2 percent objective and put—bring into play an informal makeup strategy for inflation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So, in making that change, our goal was, really—that was, changing “near” to “returning to”—was to avoid possible misinterpretation.  So you may remember, in the December minutes we noted that a few Committee members suggested that the language that stated that monetary policy would support inflation near 2 percent could be misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers were comfortable with inflation running below that level. So we thought about that in the intermeeting period and concluded that it would be appropriate to adjust that language to send a clearer signal that we’re not comfortable with inflation rising persistently—running persistently below our 2 percent symmetric objective.  So,  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL yes, there is something in that.  It’s just that we wanted to underscore our commitment to 2 percent not being a ceiling to inflation running around—symmetrically around 2 percent, and that we’re not satisfied with inflation running below 2 percent, particularly at a time such as now where we’re a long way into an expansion and a long way into a period of very low unemployment when, in theory, inflation should be moving up. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  I want to ask about the balance sheet.  How many reserves are “ample”?  How many reserves does the Fed now think it will need to conduct policy in its current framework?  And can you walk me through how you and your colleagues are arriving at that answer? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So, thanks for that question.  Why don’t I say a few things about repos, since I know that’ll be of interest.  So, just to bring you back, after last September’s brief turmoil, we took prompt and decisive action, and a result—as a result, money markets have been operating smoothly since then.  Just to review, those two adjustments were Treasury bill purchases of at least—of $60 billion—sorry—at least into the second quarter, and term and overnight repo at least through April.  And I will get to your specific question. The purpose of the adjustments has been to assure that our policy is transmitted smoothly to the federal funds rate, which requires well-functioning money markets.  It doesn’t mean we’re trying to eliminate all volatility in the repo markets.  We know that some volatility is normal and expected in well-functioning markets.  And, as I mentioned, these adjustments have been successful in supplying an ample quantity of reserves.  Money markets operated smoothly, including right through year-end, and the fed funds rate has remained in our target range.  So we know—we will know when these adjustments have run their course when reserves are durably at  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL a level that enables us to control the federal funds rate using our administered rates, the interest on reserves and reverse repo, without the need for frequent use of open market operations. Based on current projections, we expect that the bill purchases will durably bring the underlying level of reserves to the ample level sometime in the second quarter of this year.  And when we see that we’ve reached that level, we’ll begin to gradually reduce our asset purchases to the level of the underlying trend growth of demand for our liabilities.  As our bill purchases bring the underlying level of reserves up to an ample level on a sustained basis, the necessary quantity of overnight and term repo will gradually decline.  We’ve already begun the gradual reduction in the quantity of repo, and we’ll continue to reduce those offering amounts gradually as conditions permit.  At some point, we’ll also raise the minimum bid rate.  Even after we reach an ample level of reserves, it’s possible that repo operations might play a role as a backstop and support effective control of the federal funds rate.  And we’ll continue to discuss that issue and review it under our implementation framework. Coming to your question, in terms of the actually desired reserve level, we know that reserves will continue to move up and down over the course of the calendar year in a wide range depending on volatility in nonreserve liabilities, particularly the Treasury General Account, or TGA.  In particular, reserve levels will need to be at a level high enough to remain ample even when the TGA peaks during the April tax season.  Effectively, what that means is that we need reserves at all times to be no lower than they were in early September—and, I would say, around $1½ trillion, subject to learning more.  Reserves are going to move in a broad range, as I mentioned, and we want to be clear, that will be the bottom end of the range.  We want $1½ trillion or thereabouts to be the bottom end of the range.  So, most of the time, reserves will be moving in a range substantially higher than that but not going below $1½ trillion.  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL So it’s not an—it’s not something that we’re aiming at all the time.  We know that reserves will fluctuate and be substantially higher than that most of the time.  We also want interest on excess reserves and the fed funds rate to be well within the FOMC’s target range.  And we think that’ll be the case now that we made our technical adjustment. Last points—we’re committed to making this adjustment process a smooth one.  We’ll provide more details as we go, and we expect to learn as we go, as we always have.  And we’re prepared to adjust the details of the plan as necessary to foster efficient and effective monetary policy implementation.

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question.  Following up on Nick’s question, I know you said it’s not QE, but it’s $390 billion over five months, which is a lot to expand the balance sheet.  I guess I’d ask one more time on Nick’s question—is there a number that you have in mind? Secondly, a lot of people in the market are sort of concerned that it looks like QE, and they’re trading that way.  Are you concerned that the market is embracing this like a QE program, and that the rise in the stock market is linked to it, and you may then experience something of a “taper tantrum” the way Chairman Bernanke did when he tried to roll it off? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I’ll just—I’ll repeat that—we think that the—we think we need to continue purchases until the—until reserves are at a level at which they will not go below $1½ trillion, roughly, during the course of the calendar year.  And we know that the TGA will move up and down there.  So they’ll be much higher than that some of the time, but that’s kind of the number, and we think we’ll reach that sometime in the second quarter.  That’s our estimate.  But we will—we’ll know it when we get there.  We’ll know it because we’ll be able to  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL be—to control the federal funds rate without use of—without active use, ongoing use of open You know, our intention of these—for these adjustments is just to raise the level of reserves and to allow us to conduct monetary policy in an efficient and effective manner.  And that’s—that is our sole intention.  I pointed out on other occasions, more than once, the differences—the really specific differences between this and the large-scale asset purchase programs.  We’ve been over that. In terms of what affects markets, you know, I think many things affect markets.  It’s very hard to say with any precision at any time what is affecting markets.  What I can tell you is that you know what our intention is.  It is to return reserves to an ample level.  We expect that to happen during the second quarter.  And our plan as we do that is, as those purchases get to that level, we believe we can gradually reduce them, and we believe we can also gradually reduce repo as—as we reach an ample level, as we’re satisfying demand now more from underlying reserves from bill purchases rather than from repo. And, again, the last thing I’ll say is, we’re prepared to adjust the details of this plan as we’ve shown ourselves willing to do depending on conditions. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.  I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the labor market.  We’ve recently seen wages moderating a little bit by some measures, maybe even declining a little bit by others.  As you mentioned, at the lower end of the sort of talent pool, it seems like we are seeing those wages climb up a little bit, but it doesn’t seem to be consistent across the entire sort of average.  I was wondering if you’d talk a little bit about whether you guys are noticing any cracks, or whether you’re worried about that, or how you’re thinking about it.  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  The labor market continues to—to perform well.  The labor market continues to be strong.  We see strong job creation.  We see low unemployment.  Very importantly, we see labor force participation continuing to move up, really, against expectations.  If you go back a few years, you will not find a lot of forecasts suggesting that we could have been at 63.2 percent overall labor force participation or the levels of employment to population that we’re seeing now, let alone the unemployment level.  So I think we’ve learned quite a lot of good things about the labor market, good things suggesting that there’s been more room to run. The performance of wages, I think, has to be seen in that context.  We saw—if you go back four or five years, the four or five major wage statistics that we track were running at around 2 percent, and now they’re running at around 3 percent, which is theoretically about where they might be at full employment.  It would consist of inflation plus—plus productivity growth.  The—it’s a bit surprising that, with sustained levels of historically low unemployment, we haven’t seen wages moving up above that level as we have in other long expansions and other periods of low unemployment. So you asked, what can be explaining that?  You know, one thing can be that the natural rate of unemployment is still lower than we think, that the labor market is not as tight as it would appear just from the 3½ percent number.  And the other can be, I think, that—as I mentioned, the sort of supply-side shock or surprise that we’re receiving from higher labor force participation.  People are coming in to the labor market and providing more labor supply, and that is—that’s a great thing.  That’s a very healthy thing.  We’re a country that has low labor force participation compared to essentially all of our advanced-economy peers, and it’s a very good, positive thing.  Nonetheless, it represents more labor supply, and it may be holding down wages.  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  In terms of the framework review and a little bit on Chris’s question earlier, there is a general feeling now in the markets and among analysts that you’re basically setting us up for some form of inflation-target averaging where you let the inflation rate run above the 2 percent target for some time to make up for the time that it has spent below that.  Is that a fair or reasonable assessment of where you think you’re going to end up?  What would you, Chairman Powell, think of that idea personally?  And, as long as I’m asking, do you have any more details on when we can expect the results of the review? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks.  I’ll just say that we undertook the review because we felt, and I felt, that it was time to incorporate the realities of what we could call the “new normal” into our policy framework.  And some aspects of that new normal would include ongoing powerful global disinflationary trends, which have led to lower-than-target inflation many places in the world; secondly, a flat Phillips curve, by which I mean low levels of sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization—for example, low unemployment; and, thirdly, a much lower neutral real interest rate here and around the world.  So those are challenging conditions for monetary policy to deliver on our statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices, although I would say that, under our existing framework, we’ve been able to succeed or get close to succeeding it for most of the time lately to achieve those goals, although we do struggle, as other central banks do, with the inflation goal. So this is about reviewing our strategy, tools, and communications to assure that they’re the best that we can do to achieve those goals in this environment on a sustained basis.  And we continued our discussions at this meeting.  I’m very, very pleased at the process so far.  It’s included the 14 Fed Listens events around the country, at which we’ve engaged with a full range  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL of people and groups across American society.  That was a very, very positive experience, and I think we learned a lot.  We’ve now had a series of—a number of FOMC meetings at which we’ve reviewed what we’ve learned and also dug deeply into strategy, tools, and communications.  I expect that we will conclude the review and announce our conclusions around the middle of the year.  Right now, we are just at the point of coming together to put all that together. So I think I’m not the person who should be telling you my personal preferences right now.  I’m trying to—and we were trying to come together as a group around a set of answers.  I feel very positive about—that we’re going to come up with some good results, and I’m just going to have to wait until we get to that point to announce them. 

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak with CNN.  Going back to your outlook for global growth, we’ve seen some significant headwinds, as you mentioned earlier, with the easing—with the partial U.S.–China trade deal, but now that there’s some new concern following the outbreak of the coronavirus—that it might shake global growth.  We’re already seeing reports from Ford and Toyota that they’re planning to shut down their assembly plants for an extra week.  Apple is rerouting their supply chains.  Starbucks is shutting down close to thousands of stores.  Are you worried at all about what the impact would be on the U.S. economy, and do you see that as a significant risk—excuse me—to the outlook at this point? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So let me talk about the coronavirus specifically, and then I’ll turn more to global growth more generally.  First, it’s a—it’s a very serious issue, and I want to start by acknowledging the significant and considerable human suffering that the virus is already causing.  There is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and possibly globally based on  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL the spread of the virus to date and the travel restrictions and business closures that have already been imposed. Of course, the situation is really in its early stages, and it’s very uncertain about how far it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be in China and its immediate trading partners and neighbors and around the world.  So, in light of that uncertainty, I’m not going to speculate about it at this point.  I will just tell you that, of course, we are very carefully monitoring the situation. And, you know, as you suggested, our framework ultimately is, what are the potential ramifications for the U.S. economy and for the achievement of our dual mandate?  More broadly, though, if I can talk about the global economy for a second—and if you look at the backdrop, you know, if you go back to 2017, that was the year of synchronized growth that lasted into the middle of 2018, and then you saw slowing in growth, which lasted right through the end of last year.  The fourth-quarter growth globally was quite weak last year, and a number of factors played into that.  It wasn’t any one factor.  There was trade policy uncertainty, absolutely, but also there was the decision by the Chinese authorities to try to rein in leverage and financial excesses.  There was a turn—downturn in the global high-tech manufacturing cycle in global auto production.  There were some idiosyncratic strains in some countries like Argentina, Turkey.  And then, later, in Hong Kong and Chile, you had social unrest.  So, all of those things were playing into that cycle of weakening growth over the course of 2019 and the last half I would say, now there are grounds for what I would call “cautious optimism” about the outlook now for the global economy.  Many analysts are predicting a pickup in growth this year, although still to relatively modest growth rates.  And I would—people are pointing to, and we of ’18.  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL would point to, supportive financial conditions, the easing of trade tensions, the lower odds of a hard Brexit.  The high-tech manufacturing industry does appear to be rebounding well in Asia, including in China.  The latest indicators—manufacturing PMIs, for example—suggest that manufacturing may have bottomed out, that they’re still below 50 in many jurisdictions, but they have moved up off of their lows. I would—I would just say, none of this is assured.  As I mentioned, we saw the fourth quarter of last year came in quite weak—weaker than expected.  We are not at all assured of a global rebound, but there are signs and reasons to expect it.  And then comes the coronavirus, which, again, it’s too early to say what the effects will be.  Of course, we’re, as I mentioned, monitoring it carefully.  There will clearly be implications, at least in the near term, for Chinese output and, I would guess, for some of their close-in neighbors, and we’ll just have to see what the effect is globally. 

[SECTION]

BRENDAN GREELEY.  Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times.  As recently as 2018, interest on excess reserves was at the top of the band, sort of dragging the fed funds rate up.  Over the course of the adjustments since last year, it’s moved steadily down, closer to the bottom of the band.  So, if you’re moving it back up, how high do you want to get it?  Are we looking to get interest on excess reserves at the top of the band again as the fed funds rate moves to the middle of the band?  And should we see movements in IOER as an indicator that we’re approaching “ample”? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So our stated goal is to keep IOER and the federal funds rate well within the range.  That’s it.  Well within the range.  And that, clearly, you know—5 basis points from the bottom or from the top isn’t that.  So that’s why we moved back up.  You’re right.  Last year we were—we saw some tightness as reserves were draining out of the system.  We saw  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL the—gradually moving up.  And, in hindsight, we know what was happening.  With ample reserves, we see—we see that it’s possible to bring the interest on reserves rate up to 10 basis points.  So now we’re—now we are well within the range, I would say. 

[SECTION]

BRENDAN GREELEY.  We are.  So you don’t think that, as the fed funds goes back up towards the center of the range, that IOER is going to end up at the top? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Don’t know that.  We want it to be well within the range.  I think we’ll continue to adjust it to the extent it’s appropriate.  Ultimately, what we’re trying to do is deliver a federal funds rate that’s well within the range.  IOER is just a tool to do that.  If we—if we need to make changes to keep it well within the range, we’ll do that.  It just means—I mean, the thing that matters for the economy is that we keep the federal funds rate—which is the rate that, of course, transmits into other money market rates, which ultimately transmit into all kinds of financial conditions—that’s what we care about.  So, ultimately, we will—we will use that tool to keep it well within the range. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Just to sort of close the loop on one thing, where do discussions stand on a standing repo facility?  Because what you’ve said so far sort of implies that there won’t be one or that it will be a limited one.  So if you could just, you know, let us know where that discussion stands.  And also— 

[SECTION]

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER.  Can you turn mic over?  Turn the mic over. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Sorry about that.  Sorry about that.  Did you get the question?  Did you hear the question okay? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I did.  I don’t think—I’m not sure your colleagues did.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Where do the discussions stand on standing repo?  [Aside]  That was great.  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL And the other thing is, on the, you know, on the standing repo facility and on the purchases—Treasury bill purchases, as you enter this new regime later in the second quarter or later in the year, will that be preannounced by amounts?  Will there be preset amounts like you’re doing now, or will that just be something that people will have to sort of intuit and figure out as you go along? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I’ll go in reverse order.  When we—when we make decisions about the steps we’re going to be taking in that adjustment process that I described at some length, we’ll be making them as early as we can and as transparently as we can—and specifically.  But we’re not at that stage.  It’s January, and we’re several months away from—from that. In terms of the standing repo facility, as I mentioned in, I guess, in my answer to an earlier question, there may well be a role for repo in this system even after we’re at an ample-reserves level.  Now, we haven’t decided what that role is, we have not decided—we haven’t at all made a decision on a standing repo facility.  We haven’t.  We’ve had a couple of discussions about it, as you know, back in, I guess, June and October.  And there’s a range of views.  We’re going to return, I would say, fairly soon to this question. And I think it was wise to wait, because we’re still getting a better sense of what that—what that world looks like.  And, you know, it’s really going to be a question of, how useful will it be?  What will be the costs and benefits?  And my thinking is, we will return to that fairly soon, and I wouldn’t assume a decision one way or the other.  Really, we haven’t made one, because we haven’t had to.  And I think you—when you delay, you get more information by waiting.  It’s good to wait.  We don’t have any urgency in making that decision, because we’re still trying to find that sort of stable equilibrium where we’re in an ample-reserves regime.  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long from the Washington Post.  I’m wondering, do you think that there is a financial stability risk from climate change?  You’ve spoken several times that you think severe weather events are happening more often and that the Fed is monitoring what that could physically do to a bank or a financial institution, but that’s sort of one institution.  Do you think there’s a systemwide risk that may—that could develop from climate change? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So that’s an interesting question—the question being, is there a systemwide financial stability risk?  I’d say, over—over the longer term, it’s certainly possible, and I would say that sort of feeds into the way we’re thinking about climate change as an institution.  So, as I’ve mentioned, climate change is an important issue, a very important issue, but it’s essentially assigned to many other agencies in the federal government and state governments for leadership on that.  And, importantly, society’s overall response to climate change needs to be decided by elected officials and not by the Fed. All of that said, if you look at our mandate, we’ve got a monetary policy mandate and, more immediately perhaps, a supervisory mandate where we’re supervising financial markets, utilities, and financial institutions, banks.  And we haven’t—we share overall responsibility for financial stability with a number of agencies.  And that latter part—I think the public has every right to expect and will expect that we will assure that the financial system is resilient and robust against the risks from climate change. Now, I think that’s got to be right.  We are in the very early stages, as are other central banks, in understanding just what that means.  And there’s quite a lot of work going on around the world at other central banks and at the Fed, too, to think that through.  But I do think it’s—in that sense, it has to be part of our role, and—but not the overall response of society to climate change.  That’s not us.  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  And if I could follow up, can you clarify why the Fed hasn’t signed on to the Network for Greening the Financial System like 40 other central banks have? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we’ve attended all of their meetings and taken part in them, and we’ve been looking at joining in one form or another and talking to them about that.  We probably will do that at some point.  So that’s—that’s an ongoing question.  But we’re very much attending those meetings and taking part in them. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.  So there was a signing of a ratified USMCA at the White House today.  Mid-pick up at all?  If not, what will it take to get that business investment going as this uncertainty is—is being cleared up? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So I guess I’d start by saying that the fact that we’ve reached a phase-one deal with China and the fact that we’ve moved ahead closer to getting USM[C]A agreed—those are potentially positive things for the economy without question.  Without question.  And financial markets—the reaction of financial markets is very consistent with that perception.  A sustained reduction in uncertainty over time should improve business sentiment, investment, which would provide some additional support for the economy. It’s important, though, to bear in mind a couple of things.  First, trade policy uncertainty remains elevated.  Businesses continue to identify it as an ongoing risk.  We still have two or even three active trade discussions that are going on in the public square right now.  So it hasn’t gone away, and we’ve just come through a round of talking to our vast network of comments—sorry, contacts in the business world.  And I think, clearly, these are seen as positive developments going forward, but there’s a bit of a wait-and-see attitude—is this going to be  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL sustained?  The agreements have to be implemented, too, and that’ll take quite some time.  So, I would say, we need to be a little bit patient about the effect on the economy. There’s also the global economy.  You could—you could well see manufacturing—as I mentioned, manufacturing PMIs have started to tick up consistently among both advanced economies and emerging market economies.  We do not see a decisive recovery, but it’s possible that this mix of positive developments and also accommodative financial conditions could spur further growth. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Hi, Mike Derby with Dow Jones.  Do you have any greater sense of what—what was going wrong with the repo market starting in September?  There seemed to be, you know—whether it was a one-off event, you know, too tight around tax payments and debt settlement, or whether there’s a more enduring issue going on with the market, more structural forces that are basically gumming up the repo sector. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  As for those forces, so, as we indicated, we would undertake a, you know, serious review of that question and look at both our regulations and also supervisory practices.  And we’d be prepared to adjust those in ways that might encourage liquidity to flow more easily in the system as long as it didn’t undermine safety and soundness.  And so we’ve undertaken that, and we’ve done a ton of work, actually.  We don’t have anything to announce here today, but I feel good about the—what we’ve learned there.  I think—you mentioned other factors.  We will be announcing our findings.  I’m not going to give you a time, but we’re—we’re well along in that assessment at this time. I think we also found out, though, that the level of reserves that we need in the system to conduct our operations without frequent resort to open market operations was higher than we had thought and was higher than others had thought, too.  We learned that we can’t let reserves—we  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL shouldn’t let reserves go below $1½ trillion—roughly, the level of early September—at any point.  And that means that reserves will move through in a range over the course of the year that will be substantially higher than $1½ [trillion], but they won’t ever go below.  So $1½ [trillion] is not a target level.  It is the bottom of a range in which reserves will be expected to move. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  I just wanted to ask about how your balance sheet operations and repo—temporary repos—how they affect the system and who they’re helping.  Clearly, they’re mostly designed, as you said, to get—keep the fed funds rate in the range you’re looking for.  But, certainly, the repo market is also used heavily by hedge funds and other Wall Street institutions.  And so, how would you explain to, sort of, Main Street why you’re doing all this for that market?  And how would you address criticism that it is helping mostly Wall Street, along with everything else?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, let me just stress that we have a very specific and important reason for caring about money market operations generally, and that just is that we are—our monetary policy decisions are transmitted through the financial markets—through the money money markets are operating smoothly.  And they stopped operating smoothly, briefly, back in reserves so that the money markets will be able to operate smoothly on an ongoing basis. Repo markets are important, because that’s where Treasury securities—the purchase of Treasury securities, which is the way—you know, the federal—part of the way the federal government is funding its operations.  It’s the way those are financed.  So these are largely Treasury securities that have been purchased by dealers to—for distribution to—and buyers, to a substantial extent.  That’s what’s going on in the Treasury repo market.  So it’s just the financing  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL for—for that.  Now, again, we don’t—that activity is a—is a market activity.  We’re not looking to eliminate volatility or protect anybody from volatility at all.  What we care about is that volatility in the repo market can affect the transmission of—of our policy decisions to federal funds rate, and that really is important for the public. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, is the Fed going to vote tomorrow on changes to the Volcker rule restrictions on banks investing in venture capital funds?  What can you tell us about what the Fed is considering?  And why make those changes? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So we will be looking tomorrow and voting on a—a new part of—part of the existing Volcker rule, and that is the covered fund provisions of the rule.  And we’ll be making a bunch of proposed revisions that we believe are faithful to both the letter and the spirit of the law.  We’re going to put those proposals out for public discussion, and we’re going to listen carefully, as we always do, to public comments on those proposals.  Again, we believe that they will be—and you’ll see them tomorrow—will be public—you know, will be publicly—we have a Board meeting tomorrow to do that. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Now, is this just the venture capital funds, or are also you changing the rules for hedge funds and private equity funds? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  It’s covered funds.  It’s—so it’s that covered—so it’s not the proprietary trading part of Volcker.  It’s the covered funds part. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  And is there a chance that banks could take this and run and maybe even get involved in mortgage-backed securities again and risky investments? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we’ll—we think that what we’re doing is—is very consistent with safety and soundness and absolutely consistent with the letter and spirit of the  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL Volcker rule.  We’ll be—we’ll be getting comments from people, and we’ll be looking into that question, among many others. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  Thank you, Chairman Powell.  I’d like to turn your attention back to China and the health of its financial sector in particular.  And I guess I’m basing my question on reading the transcripts from 2014 that came out earlier this month.  Just—in March of that year, there was concern about the Chinese economy, and one of your colleagues on the FOMC at that time asked the staff about how the Chinese economy would hurt—hit the U.S. economy.  And the staffer said that there was a—what they were worried about was that not only was the Chinese economy slowing down, but there was the financial sector.  And the quote was:  “There’s a tremendous amount of dodgy loans in China.”  Now, I was wondering if you could give us an update on these problems in the Chinese financial sector.  And how do you think it might impact the economy, particularly now that they’ve been hit by this unexpected shock? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, China has had a problem for some years, including from that period—2014 up until, I guess, ’17 or ’18, and I thought—which was essentially just a lot of debt for an emerging market.  For an economy at the—at the stage of evolution of the Chinese economy, they had very high levels of debt—not sovereign debt the way we think of it, but more business debt—debt of state-owned enterprises and also just private businesses. And a couple of years ago the authorities decided to try to get that under control—to stop the growth and to control it.  And that—as I mentioned, that’s one of the reasons why Chinese growth slowed, and it’s one of the reasons why global growth slowed, because we felt that.  And they’ve actually stuck to that even during this difficult period when they were experiencing, you know, strains from trade negotiations and that kind of thing.  The authorities have stuck to that  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL and have, again, continued to try to do that, so—to try to control the growth of debt.  And that’s important that they do that. We don’t think that—that there’s any imminent risk there, although you—as you point out, the coronavirus thing is a significant thing, which will—will have some effects on the Chinese economy, at least in the short term.  The Chinese economy is very important in the global economy now.  And, you know, we—when China’s economy slows down, we do feel that—not as much as countries, though, that are near China or that trade more actively with China, like some of the Western European countries.  We still have—you know, 85 percent of our economy is domestic.  And we have a much smaller external sector, trade sector, than other economies just because of our physical location. 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi.  Brian Cheung here, Yahoo Finance.  So the combination of T-bill purchases and repo operations have been described colloquially as “liquidity.”  I’m just wondering if you semantically agree with that description—then, secondly, what the impact of that has been on risk assets.  I don’t know if that’s something that, you know, the Board or Reserve Banks are formally looking into or just looking at what the effect of it has been.  How are you kind of thinking about that going forward?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so, two questions.  I mean, in terms of liquidity, I think what we’re doing is what I said:  We’re trying to raise the level of reserves back up to a level so that banks can meet their reserve requirements, and that there’s enough reserves in the system that we don’t see reserve scarcity, and we don’t have to use repo operations to provide additional reserves.  So I think, as I mentioned, we believe we can get to that state at the current pace sometime in the second quarter.  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL In terms of effects on risk assets, as I said earlier, it’s very hard to say what is affecting financial markets with any precision or confidence at a given time.  It’s not our intention to change the stance of monetary policy.  These were designed to provide more reserves and, really, to do that in order to enable better transmission of our—of our rate decisions into the economy under our chosen framework.  That’s really the purpose of what we’re doing. 

[SECTION]

JEAN YUNG.  Hi.  Jean Yung with MNI.  I wanted to ask about the framework review again.  Would a shift of focus to inflation over an average period—would that call for a different policy stance if you made that shift?  And whether or not we know the answer to that question, would the Fed consider changing the stance of monetary policy for that reason even if there was no change to the economic outlook? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, as you know, we’re comfortable with our current policy stance.  We think it’s appropriate.  We think it’ll remain appropriate as long as data coming in are broadly in keeping with our outlook.  Over time—over time, though—let me take a step back.  Over time, an average inflation-targeting framework would be different than our current framework, in the sense that it wouldn’t be a—there would be some aspect of trying to make inflation average 2 percent over time, which means, if it runs below 2 percent for a time, it has to run above to bring the average up.  So that is a different framework. Our current framework is one where we say—or we’d be equally concerned with deviations of inflation from target on either side.  But that isn’t—that doesn’t suggest an intention specifically to have those deviations be symmetric.  In other words, that would—consistent with that would be having all the deviations be on one side, which is what we’ve had, actually.  So I think it is a change in framework, and over time it would lead to a different  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL approach to policy.  Again, I’m not trying to—I don’t want to comment on the current stance of policy, which we do think is appropriate. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times.  I wanted to ask you about the stock market.  By historical comparisons, as you know, valuations are considerably high.  And I just wonder how much discussion and concern you and your colleagues have about that and what risks you see for the economy. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we—we look at a very broad range of financial conditions where—there isn’t any one financial condition that we—that we look at.  And when we look at financial conditions, what matters for the real economy is substantial changes in—or, material changes in financial conditions that are sustained over a period of time. If I can, maybe I’ll—maybe I’ll answer that in the context of our overall financial stability framework.  That’s one way to look at it.  So we look at—when we look at financial stability, we look at—really, we’ve got four pillars to that, the first of which is leverage in the financial system that is at a comfortable level.  Our banks, particularly our large banks, have high levels of capital. The second is leverage in the nonfinancial sector, and that divides into households and businesses.  Households’ debt to GDP is—has been coming down since the financial crisis.  It’s not moving up.  It’s at low—low levels compared to what it was before the crisis.  So not every household—but, in the aggregate, household debt is in a good place, a very good place.  Business debt has been moving up.  We’ve been calling that out for more than a year—substantially more than a year, and it’s something we’re focused on.  And we’ve taken appropriate measures and are monitoring carefully.  But we think it’s not something that would threaten financial stability, but more be an amplifier.  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL The other one is asset purchases, getting to your—sorry, asset prices, getting to your question.  We do see asset valuations as being somewhat elevated—I do—somewhat elevated.  If you look at risk spreads, they’re narrow.  If you look at P/Es, they’re high.  I think the way to think about—a good way—one way to think about equity prices, though, is, what’s the premium you’re getting paid to own equities rather than risk-free debt?  And that’s also at fairly low levels, but not extremely low levels.  So valuations are high, but not at extremes. The final factor is funding risk.  Are big financial institutions and other players in the financial system funded with stable funding, or is there a lot of run risk?  And the answer is, very stable funding, for the most part.  So if you look at, overall—what you see, in my view, is, vulnerabilities to the financial—to financial stability are moderate overall. 

[SECTION]

KATY O’DONNELL.  Hi.  Katy O’Donnell, Politico.  I wanted to know, do you support Governor Brainard’s vision for the Community Reinvestment Act reform?  And is this something that we could see the Fed formally propose at some point? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So let me say that I think this is a good time to do—to update CRA, really, in a way that is a win–win both for the intended beneficiaries—low- and moderate-income communities—and also for banks that would like to have more certainty about—about what does and doesn’t qualify and that sort of thing.  The law can both be more effective and more efficient is—it comes down to.  And we think this is a good way.  It’s also just a good time to take on board the way the delivery of banking services has changed through technology and demographic change as well. We worked very hard to try to get on the same page with the other two agencies.  We think that an interagency final rule together would be the best outcome.  We’re sorry we haven’t been able to get there, and we still hold out some hope that we will be able to.  We spent a lot of  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL time on research and analysis and looking at meaningful reform.  You saw Governor Brainard’s recent speech presenting some of the thinking and the analysis.  And we haven’t made any been entirely on trying to get to agreement with the OCC, really.  So we haven’t made any In terms of, you know—Governor Brainard led our oversight committee over these activities for many years, and I asked her to take the lead on CRA modernization, which is a high priority for us.  I was comfortable with her speech, and I’m comfortable with the work we’ve done and with the Fed’s position on this.  As I said, we haven’t chosen to bring a proposal forward.  We haven’t decided what to do, whether—going forward.  And we’re not going to comment on the other proposal.  It’s just not appropriate to do.  It’s not about us.  It’s not about our views.  It’s about the views of the interested parties. 

[SECTION]

HANNAH LANG.  Hannah Lang with American Banker.  Thank you for being here today.  I wanted to ask about Vice Chair Quarles’s recent speech on bank supervision in which he laid out some suggestions for making changes to the supervisory regime.  I wanted to ask, do you agree with his approach?  And are there any plans to codify some of these suggestions later in the year? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I do agree that—the principles that he articulated of firm and fair supervision and effective transparency in communications.  I also think it’s a good thing that we would have brighter lines to define our LISCC supervisory portfolio, which we haven’t really had to date.  Remember that when a firm moves from one portfolio to another, that doesn’t mean that its level of scrutiny or supervision will change.  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL So—and I also thought that, you know, the—he’s raising some very interesting questions about, if you—in the first part of the speech, where he’s talking about regulation and supervision and, you know, how to—how to balance the desire for transparency and due process in everything the government does with the needs of confidential supervision.  It’s a very challenging question.  It’s one that could use further thought.  And as far as the specific, you know, proposals, there’s—you know, they’re interesting, you know, and need further development and will need lots of comment and that sort of thing. down.  That’s not too good. Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.  Thank you.  I wanted to ask you a question about the—one of the unintended consequences over the years-long low interest rate environment, and that is that savers haven’t gotten as much return as would have otherwise been the case.  What would you say to those individuals who’ve seen the Fed again cutting rates, eroding their ability to get a higher return on their savings?  And how much would you take their plight into consideration?  How much can you sympathize with them? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So we—we are assigned a job by Congress, and that is to use our tools to pursue maximum employment and stable prices.  And that’s what—that’s our focus.  Now, monetary policy is a blunt instrument, but it’s a powerful one.  So I think if you look—look at the time since the financial crisis.  That was—in the week [wake] of fairly modest growth, it was a powerful recovery in the labor market.  And part of that just is the effect of lower interest rates.  So, if—so many, many people benefit from low interest rates.  In fact, you don’t hear—when you talk to the low- and moderate-income communities, one thing you don’t  January 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL hear is, “You ought to raise rates.”  That’s not what you hear.  You hear quite the opposite, which is, you know, “Please do whatever you can to keep this expansion going.” I absolutely sympathize with people.  If you’re living on just the interest in a bank or on fixed-income generally, then that’s a challenging thing.  On the other hand, if you own a home, home values—the housing market has recovered, other financial assets have recovered, so—but, yes, for some people who are limited to those sources plus whatever other help they get, it can be challenging.  I mean, we have to do what’s best for the—for the overall society and the economy.  That’s—those are our orders from Congress.  Thanks very much.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
33,2020-03-03,"CHAIR POWELL.  Earlier today the Federal Open Market Committee announced a ½ percentage point reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate, bringing that range to 1 to 1¼ percent.  My colleagues and I took this action to help the U.S. economy keep strong in the face of new risks to the economic outlook. The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.  The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for well more than a year, the pace of job gains has been solid, and wages have been rising.  These strong labor market conditions have underpinned solid household spending, which has been the key driver of economic growth over the past year.  At the time of our FOMC meeting in January, prospects for continued economic growth remained favorable, and we judged that monetary policy was well positioned to support that outlook. Since then, the spread of the coronavirus has brought new challenges and risks.  The virus has afflicted many communities around the world, and our thoughts and prayers go out to those who’ve been harmed.  The outbreak has also disrupted economic activity in many countries and has prompted significant movements in financial markets.  The virus and the measures that are being taken to contain it will surely weigh on economic activity both here and abroad for some time.  We are beginning to see the effects on the tourism and travel industries, and we are hearing concerns from industries that rely on global supply chains.  The magnitude and persistence of the overall effects on the economy, however, remain highly uncertain, and the situation remains a fluid one. Against this background, the Committee judged that the risks to the U.S. outlook have changed materially.  In response, we have eased the stance of monetary policy to provide some more support to the economy.  Of course, the ultimate solutions to this challenge will come from  March 3, 2020  others, particularly health professionals.  We can and will do our part, however, to keep the U.S.   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   economy strong as we meet this challenge.  As always, our actions are guided by our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. In the weeks and months ahead, we will continue to closely monitor developments and their implications for the economic outlook, and we will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.  Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take a few questions. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos with the Wall Street Journal.  Two questions.  First, what changed between last week, when many of your colleagues seemed to indicate it was still too soon to tell how this might influence the outlook—what changed between last week and today?  And then, how much confidence do you have that there will be a quick and relatively complete recovery of economic activity after the peak of this virus has passed? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, what changed?  Of course, we’ve been carefully monitoring the situation since it first became known and waiting to see how it would evolve.  And I think we’ve come to the view now that this—that it is time for us to act in support of the economy.  And once you reach that decision, we decided to go ahead.  So what changed, really, was, I would say, over the course of the last couple weeks, we’ve seen a broader spread of the virus—we’ve seen it begin to spread a bit here in the United States.  But, for us, what really matters, of course, is not the epidemiology, but the risk to the economy.  So we saw a risk to the outlook for the economy and chose to act.  In terms of my confidence that we will return to—what was your question?  

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  How do you expect this to—the economy to recover from this?  Do you see it as a persistent decline in activity or something that will be relatively temporary and Was that a question? short lived?  March 3, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I don’t think anybody knows how long it will be.  I do know that the U.S. economy is strong, and we will get to the other side of this.  And I fully expect it will return to solid growth and a solid labor market as well. 

[SECTION]

JIM TANKERSLEY.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Jim Tankersley, New York Times.  You said that “the ultimate solutions” will come from others, and I have two questions about that.  First, is this a coordinated—part of a coordinated action with other central banks, and should we be expecting to see more as part of that?  And, second, what would you like to see from American fiscal policymakers in response to these new threats? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  So, first question.  We—we’re in active discussions with central banks around the world on an ongoing basis, as you would guess.  I’ve been in regular contact with central bank leaders from around the world.  That will continue.  Central banks are doing what makes sense in their particular institutional contexts, but we’re all talking to each other on an ongoing basis.  And our action today represents what we think is the right policy for us in our particular institutional context under our domestic mandate.  You saw this morning’s G-7 statement of finance ministers and governors, and I think that statement does reflect coordination at a high level in the form of a commitment to use all available tools, including health-care policy, fiscal policy, and monetary policy as “appropriate.”  So, in terms of fiscal policy, again, not our role.  We have—we have a full plate with monetary policy.  Not our role to give advice to the fiscal policymakers, but you saw the mention in the G-7 statement—as “appropriate” as well. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER SCOTT.  The G-7—Heather Scott with AFP.  The G-7 statement seemed to indicate that—I’m sorry.  I was away from the mic.  Sorry, Heather Scott with AFP.  The G-7 statement seemed to indicate that—that policymakers would use tools but were not going to do  March 3, 2020  anything imminent.  Does this contradict that, or is this in keeping with the action—the statement   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   by the G-7 this morning?  And, can I ask, what would cause you to make—take another step?  What would you be looking for, in terms of the economic outlook or data? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So the sense of the G-7, you know, is to—we have seven countries, obviously, and different policies, different situations, different mandates—a lot of overlap.  And the sense of that is to get together as a group and say at a high level that “These are the things we’re going to do.  We are going to use our tools—all of our tools in a strong way to—to try to support the economy.”  So that’s a statement of general support.  I think within that you will see actions.  You’ve seen our action.  And I think it’s up to individual countries—individual fiscal policies and individual central banks—to do what they’re going to do.  I would think it will be—it’s possible there will be some more—more formal considered coordination as we move forward. change that? In terms of—in terms of moving forward, I would say that we do like our current policy stance.  We think—we think it’s appropriate to—to support achievement of our dual-mandate goals.  But as I said in my—in my statement, we’re prepared to use our tools—tools and act appropriately, depending on the flow of events. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER SCOTT.  But anything you’ll be particularly watching that would 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I can’t point to any one thing.  It’s always a range of things. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long from the Washington Post.  There’s been some rising concern about credit markets and possible insolvencies and defaults either from businesses or individuals from the coronavirus.  Can you speak to—is the FOMC talking about this?  Are we  March 3, 2020  likely to see any emergency provisions from the CRA activated or things that you normally do   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL during, you know, a hurricane or that type of disruption to the economy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we don’t—we don’t see any of that happening yet.  Of course, we are—we are thinking about what we can do should those things happen.  There’s no evidence of it yet.  The economy continues to perform well—perform well.  As I mentioned, we do hear concerns, particularly from those most directly exposed, but there’s nothing in that nature:  Financial markets are functioning in an orderly manner and all that sort of thing.  I think when it—when it comes to those sorts of issues, though, we will be—the supervisors will be working with banks to assure that they work with their—with their borrowers and that sort of thing.  So I can imagine us doing those sorts of things, but it’s—those things are not upon us at the moment. 

[SECTION]

BRENDAN GREELEY.  Thank you.  Brendan Greeley, Financial Times.  Has the Committee discussed any other monetary policy tools, in addition to rate cuts, and the pacing and timing of when they might be appropriate? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, as you know, we’re in the middle of a review of all of our tools.  So if you go back a few meetings, we’ve talked about what our toolkit is, and we’ve put that in the minutes.  But in the current context, no.  What we discussed is the current stance of policy, is it appropriate—came to the view that it was appropriate to make a change and went ahead and did that today. 

[SECTION]

RICH MILLER.  Hi.  Rich Miller with Bloomberg.  Thank you very much for having a press conference.  Can you take us a little—through the reasoning behind the rate cut a little bit more in depth?  You know, was there a discuss—some economists say this is a supply-side shock, you know, rate cuts are not particularly suitable for this.  Others say, well, the supply  March 3, 2020  shock may morph into a demand shock.  I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more depth   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   on the reasoning behind the rate cut.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure, I’d be glad to.  So the virus outbreak is something that will require a multifaceted response.  And that response will come, in the first instance, from health-care professionals and health policy experts.  It will also come from fiscal authorities should they determine that a response is appropriate.  And it would be—come from many other public- and private-sector actors:  businesses, schools, state and local governments.  But there’s also a role for monetary policy.  Monetary policy can be an effective tool to support overall economic activity.  We do recognize that a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection.  It won’t fix a broken supply chain.  We get that.  We don’t think we have all the answers.  But we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy.  More specifically, it will support accommodative financial conditions and avoid a tightening of financial conditions which can weigh on activity, and it will help boost household and business confidence.  That’s why you’re seeing central banks around the world responding as they see appropriate in their particular institutional context. 

[SECTION]

YLAN MUI.  Thanks.  Ylan Mui from CNBC.  Can you tell us what you would do if the virus ends up being contained fairly quickly?  Would you envision the Fed actually raising rates in short order if the economic damage doesn’t occur the way that you potentially fear?  And I have a second question, which is, President Trump was just tweeting about you this morning and talking about the Fed’s need to cut rates.  Did you feel any political pressure to make this move? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, on your first question, we’re always going to set monetary policy at a given time in a way that we think best serves our dual-mandate goals, and it’s as simple as that.  So, you know, we’ll—if we get to a place where we think it’s an appropriate time to change  March 3, 2020  the stance of monetary policy, we won’t hesitate to do that.  I would also say that it’s—it’s very   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   important that people understand that we will always make our decisions based on the best thinking we have, based on our—what we learned from our outreach to businesses, nonprofits, educational institutions that we get every cycle through the Reserve Banks, and the best analysis, the best research.  We’re always going to make our decisions in the interests of the American people to carry forward and try to achieve the mandates that Congress has given us.  And we’re never going to consider any political considerations whatsoever.  We will not do that, and it’s very important that the public understand that. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.  I know—you mentioned a little bit of outreach.  Some of the Fed Bank presidents were talking about last week how much they were going to listen to their contacts.  Have you gotten reports sort of from the ground from your business contacts, nonprofits, and so forth that have affected your 

[SECTION]

 CHAIR POWELL.  So we’re—we are hearing—I would just say, the effects are at a very early stage.  But you are hearing concerns from people—for example, in the travel business or the hotel business and things like that.  That’s—that’s what you are hearing.  But you don’t see things showing up in actual data.  You do see them showing up in, sort of, sentiment forecast indicators and things like that.  We expect that will continue.  It will probably grow.  And that’s one of the reasons why we’ve come to the view that it would be appropriate for us today to move to support the economy.  And that’s what we’ve done.  Thanks very much.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
34,2020-03-15,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good evening, everyone.  Today the Federal Reserve took a number of actions to support American families and business and the economy overall and to promote the flow of credit as we weather disruptions caused by the coronavirus.  The virus is having a profound effect on people across the United States and around the world.  On behalf of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve, our first concern is for those who’ve been harmed. Families, businesses, schools, organizations, and governments at all levels are taking steps to protect people’s health.  These measures, which are essential for containing the outbreak, will nonetheless understandably take a toll on economic activity in the near term.  While the primary response to this challenge will come from our health-care providers and policy experts, economic policymakers must do what we can to ease hardship caused by the disruptions to the economy and to support a swift return to normal once they have passed. The Federal Reserve’s role is guided by our mandate from Congress to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  Today we reduced the target range for our policy interest rate by 1 percentage point, bringing it close to zero, and said that we expect to maintain the rate at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.  In addition, we took other actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. Before describing our actions more fully, I will share how my colleagues and I currently view the economic outlook.  The economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing.  The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February and has been at or near half-century lows for almost two years.  Job gains have been running at a solid pace, well above what is needed to  March 15, 2020  provide jobs for new entrants into the labor market.  Participation in the labor force by people in   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL  their prime working years remained near its highest rate in more than a decade.  And wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs.  Overall economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate, even though weak growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on some sectors.  U.S. banks are strong, have high levels of capital and liquidity, and are well positioned to provide credit to households and businesses. Against this favorable backdrop, the virus presents significant economic challenges.  Like others, we expect that the illness and the measures now being put in place to stem its spread will have a significant effect on economic activity in the near term.  Those in travel, tourism, and hospitality industries are already seeing a sharp drop in business.  In addition, the effects of the outbreak are restraining economic activity in many foreign economies, which is causing difficulties for U.S. industries that rely on global supply chains.  The weakness abroad will also weigh on our exports for a time.  Moreover, the energy sector has recently come under stress because of the large drop in global oil prices.  Inflation, which has continued to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective, will likely be held down this year by the effects of the outbreak. Financial conditions have also tightened markedly.  The cost of credit has risen for all but the strongest borrowers, and stock markets around the world are down sharply.  Moreover, the rapidly evolving situation has led to high volatility in financial markets as everyone tries to assess the path ahead.  In the past week, several important financial markets, including the The market for Treasury securities is a critical part of the foundation of the global financial system.  It is generally the most liquid of all markets and serves as the benchmark by which many other financial assets are valued.  It plays an important role in allowing households  March 15, 2020  and firms to earn a safe return and manage their risks.  When stresses arise in the Treasury   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call  FINAL this from happening and to support the smooth functioning of the Treasury market, we announced today that we will purchase at least $500 billion of Treasury securities over the coming months. Similar stresses have also emerged in the market for agency mortgage-backed securities, which is closely linked to the Treasury market and critically supports the ability of people to get a mortgage to buy a house or refinance an existing mortgage.  To improve the functioning of this we will also purchase at least $200 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities over coming months and immediately cease the runoff of these securities in our portfolio.  While the primary purpose of these securities purchases is to restore smooth market functioning so that credit can continue to flow, the purchases will also foster more accommodative financial conditions. The Federal Reserve announced a number of other actions today to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, thereby promoting our maximum employment and price stability goals.  Of these, I will highlight two.  First, we reduced the interest rate on discount window loans by 1½ percentage points, bringing that rate to ¼ percent.  The discount window plays an important role in supporting liquidity and stability in the banking system, and we encourage banks to turn to the discount window to help meet demands for credit from households and businesses.  To make the discount window more effective, we will also offer discount window loans for periods up to 90 days. Because of the importance of the U.S. dollar in the global economy, strains in markets for borrowing and lending dollars overseas can disrupt financial conditions here in the United States.   March 15, 2020  To guard against such disruptions, the Federal Reserve maintains swap lines with five major   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call  FINAL central banks.  When dollar funding pressures emerge abroad, those central banks can contain the pressures in their jurisdictions and prevent them from impeding the flow of credit here at home.  To address potential pressures in these markets during the current period of elevated uncertainty, we made a coordinated announcement with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to reduce the pricing on our dollar swap lines.  In addition, our central bank counterparts will begin offering dollars to institutions in their jurisdictions for a term of 84 days in addition to the usual one-week operation.  These long-standing arrangements carry no risk to the Federal Reserve or to the American taxpayer. I won’t go into detail on the other actions we took today, but they involved eliminating reserve requirements for banks and encouraging banks to make use of intraday credit with the Federal Reserve and to use their capital and liquidity buffers as they support lending to households and businesses. The actions we have announced today will help American families and businesses and, indeed, our entire economy weather this difficult period and will foster a more vigor—more vigorous return to normal once the disruptions from the coronavirus abate.  We will continue to closely monitor economic and financial developments and their implications for the economic outlook.  We are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and business, to help keep the economy strong, and to promote our maximum employment and price stability goals.    Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call  FINAL Finally, let me note that today’s FOMC meeting today was in lieu of the meeting scheduled for next Tuesday and Wednesday.  Thank you.  I’ll be—I’ll be happy to take a few of  your questions. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  The Chair will now take some questions.  Please dial “star 1” on your phone to indicate you want to ask a question.  You will be unmuted when you are called on.  [Extended silence]  Okay, CNBC. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, how effective do you expect this—these actions to be?  Do you—do you think a recession is inevitable and/or can be avoided?  Secondly, there was talk about additional programs that could come out—for example, a Primary Dealer Credit Facility or a Term Auction Facility.  Do you expect those to be announced soon?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  So, based on our discussions today and many conversations with participants, it’s fair to say that we have a range of views about the path of the economy, as is always the case with the Fed.  But, in general, I’d say that we see the U.S. economy as having been in quite a strong position before the arrival of the virus.  We see that it is likely that the measures we take to protect ourselves from the virus will involve withdrawing from or reducing certain activities—thinking there of travel, leisure, hospitality, those things—and that’s going to mean lower economic activity for a period of time.  These are choices that we make to protect ourselves—appropriate choices that we make to protect ourselves from the virus. So that means that the second quarter is probably going to be weak—in fact, in the view of many, output declining—output lower in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter.  After that, it’s very hard to say how big the effects will be or how long they will last.  And that’s  March 15, 2020  going to depend, of course, on how widely the virus spreads, which is something that is highly   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call  FINAL uncertain, and I would say, in fact, unknowable. We do know that the virus will run its course and that the U.S. economy will resume a normal level of activity.  In the meantime, the Fed will continue to use our tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and support demand with monetary policy—ultimately, to do what we can to see that the recovery is as vigorous as possible. You also asked about other facilities.  I would point out that we have, of course, responded very strongly not just with interest rates, but also with liquidity measures today.  And we believe that what we did today will be beneficial to financial markets generally.  And as I said in my statement, we’re prepared to use our full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, thanks.  We’ll go to Marketplace radio. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Hi, Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, I’m wondering, are you considering negative interest rates at this point?  Is there a scenario in which you think that would be appropriate? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, as I’ve noted on a number of occasions, really, the Committee—as you know, we did a year-plus-long study of our tools and strategies and communications.  And we, really, at the end of that, and also when we started out, we view forward guidance and asset purchases—asset purchases and also different variations and combinations of those tools as the basic elements of our toolkit once the federal funds rate reaches the effective lower bound—so, really, forward guidance, asset purchases, and combinations of those.  You know, we looked at negative policy rates during the Global Financial Crisis, we monitored their use in other  March 15, 2020  jurisdictions, we continue to do so, but we do not see negative policy rates as likely to be an   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call  FINAL appropriate policy response here in the United States. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we’re going to the Wall Street Journal. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  I guess I wanted to understand, specifically, how the actions you’ve announced this evening will get credit to households and firms that are going to see large drops in income and revenue.  And also, to the extent that they are needed, what steps would you recommend the fiscal authorities undertake—again, to make sure that firms with large drops in income and revenue don’t go bust over the next few weeks or months? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So let me tell you how, I think—what our tools can accomplish, and—and really what they’re not designed to accomplish.  So what our liquidity operations—and I’ll talk specifically about the Treasury and MBS purchases—are designed to do is to assure the proper functioning of the Treasury and MBS markets.  The Treasury market is one of the most important, perhaps the most important, market in the world.  It’s probably the most liquid large economy.  So, two very important markets.  And they had reached levels of very high illiquidity, and—to the point where we—as you know, last week we offered financing—very large amounts of financing.  And after that, we bought assets across the curve to try to support liquidity and return to normal function.  And we found that that helped, but, nonetheless, we thought we had to do more.  And we knew what we had to do, which was the asset purchase programs that we did today.  And those are designed to restore those key markets to normal function.  March 15, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call  FINAL Now, why is that important to—to everyone?  These markets are part of the foundation of the global financial system and of the United States financial system.  And if they are not functioning well, then other markets—then that will spread to other markets.  And those are the we know that dysfunctional financial markets—a dysfunctional financial system, really, can have very big negative effects on the economy.  We saw that during the financial crisis.  This is a very different situation, but, nonetheless, we thought it was quite important for us to take strong measures to support—to support proper market function in these important markets. Now, you asked about households.  It’s true, we don’t have the tools to reach individuals and particularly small businesses and other businesses and people who may be out of work or whose businesses may not—may experience a period of very low activity.  We don’t have those tools.  We have the tools that we have, and we use them.  I think we’ve used them quite aggressively for the benefit of the public.  But this is a multifaceted problem, and it requires answers from different parts of the government and society.  I mean, I think that, by far, the most important is the response of the health-care workers and health-care policymakers.  After that, fiscal policy.  We’ve had one round of fiscal policy, another coming.  I think fiscal policy is a way to direct relief, really, to particular populations and groups.  Monetary policy has a role, and it really is in, you know—our original role was providing liquidity to financial systems when they’re under stress, and that’s—that’s really part of what we did today.  The other role is to support demand through lower interest rates, and we did that. You—you asked about fiscal as well, and I guess I’ve sort of covered that.  We do think fiscal response is—is critical, and we’re happy to see that those measures are being considered, and we—we hope they are effective.  March 15, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call  FINAL

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we’re going to go to Fox Business. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.  In your statement, you say that the market measures of inflation have of the FOMC meetings.  Now, does the Federal Reserve see deflation coming, and is this large cut meant to get in front of any more inflation?  Plus, as a second question, would the Fed consider buying securities outside of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So, on—on inflation, you know, the—the economy’s performed so well, really, over the last few years, and right up through January:  historically low unemployment—50-year-low unemployment for a couple of years, 11 years—almost 11 years of expansion so far, and yet inflation lingered below 2 percent.  So we’ve been concerned that inflation not move down further.  It’s not at all a question of deflation.  It was a question of not getting inflation up to our target on a robust, symmetric kind of a way. So, with this coronavirus arriving, we judged that the—the net effects of this will be to—to have inflation move down even a little bit more.  And it’s—it’s not a question—it’s not—it’s not an issue of deflation.  Again, it’s just an issue of inflation probably falling even a bit further.  We expect, with uncertainty, that, you know—that it will fall a little bit further, at least, below where it has been.  We are—of course, we don’t have the legal authority to buy other securities other than the ones we already buy, and we’re not seeking authority to do so.  We haven’t discussed that at the—at the FOMC, and it’s not—it’s not legal authority that we’re seeking. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we’ll go to the Financial Times. 

[SECTION]

BRENDAN GREELEY.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  This is Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times.  You have talked about the mortgage-backed security purchases and the  March 15, 2020  Treasury purchases as a stability—a stability operation.  I’m pretty sure that every person on this   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL  call has an editor asking to determine whether or not this is quantitative easing.  How do we draw a distinction between these asset purchases and something you may do in the future that is explicit quantitative easing?  Or can we think of this as the first step in quantitative easing? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So what—what I can tell you definitively is what the purpose of the asset purchases was, and I mentioned this in my statement.  And it really is to support the availability of credit in the economy—households and businesses—and thereby support the overall economy.  How do they do that?  They do that by supporting proper market functioning in the Treasury market and the MBS market.  So you see—and I think you’ll see—as these purchases roll forward, you will see the Treasury market and the MBS market returning to normal market function, and that will actually support economic activity.  That will be a positive for economic activity. In terms of what it’s labeled, that’s of less interest to me.  I really think we are very clear in our minds what we’re doing this for and what the logical effects would be, which would be—which would be both better market function and—and—you know, when there’s better market function, it will be—you know, policy will be supporting the economy better. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, Bloomberg TV. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to ask some timing questions here.  First, on the—whatever it is, QE or not QE, you talk in the press release about increase “over coming months.”  Is there a timetable for that?  How long are we talking about—$700 billion, obviously, over two months is a lot different from $700 billion over the course of a year.  And do you have a date where you would reevaluate and perhaps add more or end the program?  And the same with the interest rate cut to zero—how long do you think that might last, and  March 15, 2020  would you be inclined to quickly go back to a higher level, the 100 basis points or more that you   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL  cut it from?  Or would you anticipate that this will be a long, slow process going back? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Okay, so—sorry. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Mike, can you ask your question? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  What was it again?  What was the question again?  Just tell me.  I can’t read my writing.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  I was asking about timing.  How long a period— 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Ah, okay, great. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  —are we talking about for the QE purchases, and how long do you anticipate keeping rates low, and how fast would you bring them back up again? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Okay, sorry.  So that’s the “in coming months” language.  Let me tell you what we were doing there.  So there’s no monthly cap here.  There's no weekly cap.  The Desk is going to go out, and it’s going to buy at a strong rate that is—that we think will restore ended, and it’s meant to send a signal to the market that—that, you know, we’re not going to be bound by, for example, $60 billion a month or anything like that.  We’re going to go in strong starting tomorrow, and we’re going to buy across the curve, and we’re going to buy MBS, and we’re really going to use our tools to do what we need to do here, which is restore these important markets to normal function.  So that—that’s really what that is. As far as—as the policy rate, what we’ve said is that we will maintain the rate at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.  So, you can see, that’s the test we’ve written down.  And if you—if you look at it, you’ll see that some things have to happen  March 15, 2020  before we’d consider—we’d have to become confident of—that the economy has weathered   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call  FINAL these recent events and also is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.  So that’s a test we’ll be looking at, and I think it suggests that, you know, we’re going to be watching and willing to be patient, certainly. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we’re going to go to the Associated Press. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi, it’s Chris Rugaber at AP.  In 2008, you had a lot of coordination between the White House at that time, the Fed, the Treasury—Bernanke doing a lot of things with Paulson and so forth.  You know, today the White House had its press conference at 5:00.  You guys are doing something a little separate.  Is there—do you think it would be more helpful to markets—perhaps, in the broader economy, to have a more coordinated response?  Is that something we might look for in the future? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I would say this.  You know, we have different tools.  I think we do, actually, work pretty closely with the Treasury Department and—and cooperate with them on things, with clear lines of delineation.  For example, the Treasury Department has authority over fiscal policy.  That’s not our job.  It’s their job, with other parts of the Administration.  It’s just that—like that for us with monetary policy.  We have sole responsibility for monetary policy and strong instructions from Congress to conduct it in an independent, nonpolitical way.  So those two things are—one for each of us. But in the middle there, there are areas where we—where we can cooperate.  And also, there’s a long history.  You would want the finance ministry and the treasury [and the central bank] to be talking in every major economy in the world.  You would want them to be regularly exchanging information—professional relationships not just at the, you know, the Chair-to-Treasury-Secretary level, but also through the organization.  For example, the New York Fed is  March 15, 2020  the Treasury’s agent—fiscal agent, as you know, so there’s a lot that goes into debt management   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL  and the issuance of debt, which happens at the New York Fed.  So I think we do, actually—we have professional, good working relationships up and down the chain there, and, you know, that—that seems to me to be working.  And there is—there’s also quite a lot of coordination in other respects with—of course, with foreign central banks, but you didn’t ask about that. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we’re going to go to the Washington Post.  [Silence]  Washington Post, are you there? 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Hey, sorry, I’m here.  I think—hi, Chair Powell.  Two questions this evening.  First, have you personally been tested for coronavirus, and are you working from home?  If you could shed some light on the precautions you’re taking.  And, second, do you believe the Fed has sufficient tools at the moment, or are you seeking congressional action to expand your tool set? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I feel fine.  I feel very well, and so there’s no reason for me to be tested.  We are observing—we’re trying to model good behavior here, so we’re observing quite a lot of teleworking.  And also, we’re—you know, we’re not having a lot of big, crowded meetings—we’re not having any big, crowded meetings.  So we’re trying to observe all of the things that the professionals tell us to do.  I do expect to do some teleworking because I want to model that—that it’s okay for the people to do so.  In fact, it’s important for them to do so.  So I will do that. In terms of our—of our toolkit, let me say first that, you know, I think we do have plenty of space to adjust our policy.  I mentioned our liquidity tools—you know, we have a lot of power in our liquidity tools, and, as I mentioned, we’re prepared to use them.  In addition, we’ve got plenty of space left to offer forward guidance, asset purchases, and adjust those policies, so I  March 15, 2020  think we do have room.  We—we have not at all made a decision to request further—further   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call  FINAL tools or authorities from Congress, no.  We—we have not made that decision.  It is not something we’re actively considering right now. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we’ll go to the New York Times. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  This is Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.  Thanks for taking our questions.  I’m just curious—you know, obviously, you held this meeting in lieu of your meeting later this week.  Will you still release a Summary of Economic Projections?  And if not, how should we understand how you guys are thinking about the economy as the coronavirus shapes up? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So why no—I guess you’re asking, why no SEP, and what’s our forecast?  So a couple reasons we didn’t do an SEP.  First, we decided on Thursday to move the meeting up by three days to today, and that’s before the SEPs are generally filed.  They hadn’t been filled out, and we—frankly, we spent our time focused on getting ready to make these announcements.  Second, and, you know, a number of FOMC participants had already reached out to make the point that the economic outlook is evolving on a daily basis, and it really is depending heavily on the spread of the virus and the measures taken to affect it and how long that goes on.  And that is just not something that’s knowable.  So, actually, writing down a forecast in that circumstance didn’t seem to be useful, and, in fact, it could have been more of an obstacle to clear communication than a help.  I do expect that we’ll return to the quarterly—regular quarterly cycle in June, however. In terms of the forecast, so, as I mentioned, you know, we see the U.S. economy starting out strong—from a strong position, different—different as we—as we talked through it today.  People have a range of perspectives on the way the year is going to go, but I think there’s a  March 15, 2020  pretty broad sense that the second quarter will be a weak quarter, with probably out—you know,   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL  output declining a bit.  After that, it becomes hard to say, you know, what’ll happen in the third and fourth quarters and thereafter, and it’s going to depend, again, on—on the path of the virus.  So the thing we do know is that we’ll be here doing our job and supporting the flow of credit and there to do what we can when the recovery comes to make it as vigorous as possible. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Now we’ll go to Bloomberg News. 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Craig Torres at Bloomberg News.  You say the path of the economy more or less depends on the path of the virus.  How important is fiscal policy now in determining whether this sudden stop in activity is long or short and of high human consequence or little human consequence?  And, second, can you talk a little bit about what’s on your dashboard for economic and financial indicators that you’re going to be watching day to day?  I know Vice Chair Clarida said that we should start seeing the data show up in 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, in terms of fiscal policy, I think in the first instance—and you’re—you’re seeing some of this now—is the thing that fiscal policy and, really, only fiscal policy can do is reach out directly to affected industries, affected workers, and we’ve seen some of that.  So, that’s—that’s an important job for fiscal policy.  More broadly, after that, there’s the question of—of fiscal—broader fiscal stimulus, and I think that’ll depend on the path of the economy.  I—I think there is such a wide range of possibilities here that it’s some—it’s very hard to predict.  But there could certainly be—there could certainly be, you know, a need for that.  And your second question was—what was your second question? 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Yes.  It was on what indicators you’re going to be looking at, financial and real.  March 15, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think, in the very near term, we’re going to be looking at, you know, the Treasury market function.  We’re really going to be looking to see that financial job.  That is—actually, you know, that is the thing that central banks were originally designed to do, was to provide liquidity to financial systems in stress, so we take that job very seriously.  It’s probably the most important thing we’re doing now is that.  So we’ll be watching that and we’ll be prepared to use our tools when and as appropriate to address—to—to support market functioning and really to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.  Those are the things I’ll be looking at.  You know, in terms of economic data, I think it’s just so early.  You know, we’re really looking—I mean, the economic data will follow the data on the spread of the virus.  You know, I think what happens—what happens during the spread of the virus is probably not going to tell you a lot about where the economy will be in six months.  It’s going to be—because you may have a—you probably have a bad quarter in the second quarter, but if things get better in the third quarter, that probably won’t matter so much.  We may be able to come back from that.  If it lasts longer—so that’s really what I’ll be looking for, is—is what is going to be the spread of the virus and what’s the path it’s going to take and what are the effects on the economy. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we’ll go to NBC News now. 

[SECTION]

DAVID GURA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  This is David Gura from NBC News.  And a lot of good questions here, so I’ll—I’ll turn to one that’s more philosophical in nature.  And you’ve talked a bit about the—the disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak and having lower economic activity for a period of time.  I’m reckoning with fact that my kid’s going to be out of school until April 20 at the earliest, so we’re feeling this very, very acutely.  But I wonder if you  March 15, 2020  could just give us your perspective on the time horizon here and put that into some broader   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call  FINAL context—how you look at this and how anomalous this thing is with which you and your colleagues are going to have to reckon.  That’s my first question. The second is, you know, we’ve seen a variety of tools here deployed over these last few weeks, and the market—which I know is something that you pay at least minimal attention to—has reacted negatively to some of that.  What do you make of that?  Going back to the question that was asked earlier about the toolbox and—and what’s left—what’s left in it, rates are low.  Does that provoke any apprehension, any nervousness on your part that there are fewer tools therein? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess your first question is, how—how do we think about the time—the time for this thing?  You know—and the truth is, we just don’t know, and, you know, the experts we talk to will say that they don’t know, and that it’s, in fact, unknowable.  It’s going to depend on a number of things.  First, it’s the measures that we take to, you know, to—with the social distancing, and the—all the things businesses and school and everyone’s doing now.  And that will depend, to some extent, on how compliant people are.  You can see that some countries have had a—have been able to, through aggressive measures and really high compliance—have been able to bend the curve and—and do that.  And whether we succeed or—you know, that’s really the question.  And I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t, you know—I’ll resist the impulse to guess.  I really don’t know what that will be. In terms of the toolbox, as I mentioned, we think we have plenty of policy space left, plenty of power left in our tools, and I would point in particular to the liquidity tools.  That, I think, is—is right now the most important thing that we’re doing.  Our interest rates will matter—cuts will matter now to borrowers who will get some relief from our cuts, but they’ll  March 15, 2020  matter a lot more when the economy begins to recover.  So—but in the forefront now are the   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call  FINAL liquidity tools and—and getting that job done well. In addition, as I mentioned, we—you know, we have room to provide forward guidance, to do more asset purchases.  I think there—there is room for us to do what we need to do.  I—I would just close, though, by saying that, you know, typically, fiscal policy does play a major role when—when there are downturns.  You saw—you’ve seen that in many past downturns, and that’s beyond just the automatic stabilizers.  Sometimes fiscal policy comes in on a discretionary basis, and that—that will probably need to be the case here as well. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we’ll go to Politico. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.  Thanks for doing the call.  I just wanted to ask, do you see a bigger role here for the Financial Stability Oversight Council?  With all the stress that’s showing up in different markets, do you see risks to financial stability rising?  Do you think there are some activities that FSOC might want to crack down on?  And are you confident that there aren’t any nonbanks that are systemically important? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  FSOC is really something that the Treasury Secretary chairs.  And it’s a big group—it’s got a lot of people.  I think it serves a good purpose.  But, you know, you should know that we are, of course, in regular contact with the other regulatory agencies, constantly talking about what’s going on in markets.  There’s a lot of information and conversation on an ongoing basis there, I would say.  So—and the same is true with our central bank contacts around the world.  We’re in ongoing contact with all the major central banks around the world, talking about what’s going on.  We’re having group calls, we’re calling one-on-one, so there’s quite a lot of information being exchanged there.  March 15, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call  FINAL And then, your question was, nonbank SIFIs.  You know, again, that’s a judgment for the—that’s a judgment for the FSOC.  I—you know, I’m comfortable with the actions that we’ve taken, and if—if we do identify, you know, a systemically important nonbank institution, then we wouldn’t hesitate to designate it, but—although I guess now we’re working more on activities, but we do still have the power to designate institutions, so— 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay— 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Financial stability risks—are those rising? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I’m sorry, the question was— 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Are risks to financial stability rising, given all the stress that’s happening in financial markets? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, yes.  I would say, you know, that’s—that’s something that happens when markets are as volatile as they are, when you’re having these big market movements while markets are trying to understand what’s going on.  They’re trying to reach a view on—in high uncertainty, and that’s why you see lots and lots of volatility.  I think there’s more risk to financial stability in an era like—like that than there is when things are really placid, and, you know, we’re going home at 4 o’clock and kind of bored over here.  That’s not the case right now.  So, financial stability—I would say those—those risks do rise at a time of high volatility, particularly a time where we’re presenting—presented with a challenge that is—is kind of unique, really—it’s not something we’ve all done before. I also want to add, though, that, you know, we’re strongly focused on financial stability.  We monitor it carefully.  We’ve built a very resilient financial system.  The banks are highly capitalized, lots of liquidity, much better at understanding and managing their risks, their resilience to stress.  So our financial stability focus—our focus on an event like this over the last  March 15, 2020  10 years will pay dividends, in the sense that you have a much more resilient financial system   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call  FINAL than you’ve had before. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we’ll go to Market News. 

[SECTION]

JEAN YUNG.  Hi, this is Jean Yung.  I wanted to ask, a few days ago the Open Market Desk expanded its term repo operations, but the take-up was a bit low.  Is that—did you have any takeaway from that?  Did that indicate to you that the repos were not working as you had envisioned it, or was there something else that you learned from that?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  Yes, so we saw, and everyone saw, that liquidity had become very strained in Treasury and MBS markets, and we decided to offer very large quantities of term and overnight repo to address that.  That makes it easier to finance the purchase of repos—sorry, of Treasuries and MBS.  So we did that, and as you pointed out, the take-up was not as high as many had expected, and I did—we did learn something from that.  We thought that was worth doing, and what we learned was that we needed to go direct here rather than trying to intermediate through the dealers. And so we realized at that point that we would need to actually purchase securities for our portfolio, so we did that on Friday.  We bought—the next day, Friday, we went in and we bought across the curve, and we bought, I think, $37 billion worth of securities, and then we saw what happened with that.  We saw that market function improved a little bit, but still it wasn’t what we needed.  And that’s why we brought together the full FOMC and had our meeting this afternoon and announced these measures this evening, which are strong measures, with the broad support of the Committee to provide really substantial amounts of liquidity.  And I—I think you can see us working through different solutions and—and finding the one that we think really will work and then acting quite vigorously, quite aggressively tonight to implement it.  March 15, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we’re going to go to Reuters for the last question. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Two things, if I could.  Could you describe any discussions you’ve had in coordination with the major banks—this whole talk of drawing down liquidity, drawing down capital buffers—how far can they draw it down?  How much do you think they can put out—out to customer finance?  Did you get explicit agreements for them that this will go to customer finance and not something else?  And then, secondly, is there any discussion yet of—of using the 13(3) powers of the Fed to do some sort of direct lending facility? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We have given broad general guidance to the banks.  We’d like them to use their buffers to provide—you know, to provide loans and—and also to work with their borrowers.  As you can see, we’re providing a lot of guidance to them across a wide range, and they’re saying they have every intention of doing that.  That’s good to hear.  And—so we’ll see how that works out.  There—there are a lot of discussions going on, and, you know, we hear the banks saying, that’s exactly what they’re going to do, so that’s a good thing. You know, we’re—of course, we’ve—we’re—we have nothing to announce on—on 13(3) powers, but, you know, of course, we—that’s part of our playbook in—you know, in any situation like this.  So, as I said, we’re—we’re prepared to use our authorities as is appropriate to—you know, to support borrowing and lending in the economy, and, hence, to support the availability of credit to households and businesses. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, thank you very much.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
35,2020-04-29,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  Thanks for joining us today.  I would like to begin by acknowledging the tragic loss and tremendous hardship that people are experiencing both here in the United States and around the world.  The coronavirus outbreak is first and foremost a public health crisis, and the most important response is coming from those in the front lines in hospitals, emergency services, and care facilities.  On behalf of the Federal Reserve, let me express our sincere gratitude to those dedicated individuals who put themselves at risk, day after day, in service to others and to our nation. The forceful measures that we as a country are taking to control the spread of the virus have brought much of the economy to an abrupt halt.  Many businesses have closed, people have been asked to stay home, and basic social interactions are greatly curtailed.  People are putting their lives and livelihoods on hold, at significant economic and personal cost.  All of us are affected, but the burdens are falling most heavily on those least able to carry them.  It is worth remembering that the measures we are taking to contain the virus represent an investment in our individual and collective health.  As a society, we should do everything we can to provide relief to those who are suffering for the public good. While many standard economic statistics have yet to catch up with the reality we’re experiencing, it’s clear that the effects on the economy are severe.  Millions of workers are losing their jobs:  Next week’s jobs report is expected to show that the unemployment rate, which was at 50-year lows just two months ago, has surged into double digits.  Household spending has plummeted as people stay home, and measures of consumer sentiment have fallen precipitously.  Hotels, airlines, restaurants, department stores, and other retailers have been particularly hard hit.  Manufacturing output fell sharply in March and is likely to drop even more  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL rapidly this month, as many factories have temporarily closed.  Overall, economic activity will likely drop at an unprecedented rate in the second quarter.  Inflation is also being held down, reflecting weaker demand as well as significantly lower energy prices. Both the depth and the duration of the economic downturn are extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on how quickly the virus is brought under control.  The severity of the downturn will also depend on the policy actions taken at all levels of government to cushion the blow and to support the recovery when the public health crisis passes. The Federal Reserve’s response is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  We are also committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.  Last month we quickly lowered our policy interest rate to near zero.  We stated then and again today that we expect to maintain interest rates at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Of course, lowering interest rates cannot stop the sharp drop in economic activity caused by closures and other forms of social distancing.  And low rates will not effectively spur the economy if those rates do not feed through to broader financial conditions or if households and businesses are unable to get credit. The economic disruptions caused by the virus created tremendous strains in some essential financial markets and have impaired the flow of credit in the economy.  Without access to credit, families can be forced to cut back on necessities and could lose their homes.  Businesses can be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further losses of jobs and incomes and worsening the downturn.  Preserving the flow of credit is thus essential for mitigating the  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL damage to the economy and setting the stage for the recovery.  We have been taking broad and forceful actions to these ends. To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, foster smooth market functioning, and promote effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we have been purchasing large amounts of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities.  The markets for these securities play a critical role in the economy, and they came under great stress last month as the scale of economic disruption became clearer and as investors clamored for liquidity.  Our purchases have helped market conditions improve substantially in recent weeks.  In light of this improvement, we have slowed our pace of purchases.  We will continue our purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities as needed.  While the primary purpose of these securities purchases is to preserve smooth market functioning and effective policy transmission, the purchases will offer—will also foster more accommodative financial conditions. We are also undertaking programs to provide stability to the financial system and to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy—for households, for businesses of all sizes, and for state and local governments.  These programs benefit the economy by providing financing where it is not otherwise available.  In addition, by serving as a backstop to key credit lenders to extend credit.  Many of these programs rely on emergency lending powers that are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today.  We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by the financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury.  We will continue to use these powers  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL forcefully, proactively, and aggressively until we’re confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery. I would stress that these are lending powers and not spending powers.  The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.  We can only make loans to solvent entities that the—with the expectation that the loans will be repaid.  Many borrowers will benefit from our programs, as will the overall economy.  But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer.  In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.  Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources.  The Cares Act and other legislation provide direct help to people, businesses, and communities.  This direct support can make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy. At the Fed, we’re doing all we can to help American families and businesses weather this difficult period.  When the spread of the virus is under control, businesses will reopen, and people will come back to work.  We will continue to use our tools to assure that the recovery, when it comes, will be as robust as possible.  Thank you, and I’ll be glad to take your questions.

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  You guys have cut rates to zero, you’re buying up huge quantities of government debt—I guess the question is, what more can you realistically do to help the economy, and where do you see a need for Congress to step in? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So let me say that we’re—we’re committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.  We’re going to use them, as I mentioned,  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL forcefully, proactively, and aggressively until we’re confident that we’re solidly on the road to recovery and also to assure that that recovery, when it comes, will be as robust as possible.  As long as needed, we’ll use them.  And I would just say, we have a number of dimensions on which we can still provide support to the economy.  As you know, our credit policies are not subject to a specific dollar limit.  They can be expanded as appropriate, and we can do new ones.  So we can continue to be part of the answer. Will there be a need to do more, though?  I think the answer to that—that will be “yes.”  I would say, Congress has also reacted quite aggressively and strongly with the Cares Act and other laws—several other laws.  And that’s appropriate.  With enhanced unemployment insurance and the Paycheck Protection Program, we’ve seen an extraordinary, historically large reaction.  But I would say that it may well be the case that the economy will need more support from all of us if the—if the recovery is to be a robust one.

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  I want to follow up on Jeanna’s question and ask, what specifically do you think elected officials should consider in order to help return or hasten a stronger return to full employment?  And what policy tools did you discuss at your meeting today that might be used to stop a deflationary spiral? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So let me—let me start—I’ll take the questions in the order you—you gave them.  So in terms of, if I can say, legislative priorities, we don’t—we’re not responsible for fiscal policy.  Those will be decisions for Congress to make.  But I would say that policies that protect workers, businesses, and households from avoidable insolvency, that keep businesses going so that they’re able to produce goods and—and to either hold on to their  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL employees or quickly rehire them, those are going to be key policies.  They’ll come with a hefty price tag, but we would come out of this event eventually with—with a stronger economy and with less long-run damage to the economy.  So that’s—that’s a key thing that—that, really, Congress could do over time. In terms of what we can do, I mentioned, we have our—our credit facilities are—are wide open.  We can do more on that front.  In addition, you know, we’ve had—we’ve had extensive discussions, as I’ve mentioned—done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy might look like over—in coming months over a range of potential scenarios for the economy.  We do think that our—our policy stance today is right where it should be for now.  As you know, we cut rates to the effective lower bound, we—and we’ve said that we’ll keep them there until we’re confident that the economy has weathered the effects of the outbreak and is on track to achieve our goals.  With asset purchases, we’re continuing to purchase Treasury securities and agency MBS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning.  So we’re doing those things, and I would say that we’ll continue to use our tools as needs be. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve Liesman. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, question—Steve Liesman with CNBC.  I’ve got two questions here.  First of all, why aren’t you announcing or conducting a specific quantitative easing program?  And—and maybe you could explain what the context is now of the purchases that will be made and the amounts that are to come. The second question I have is, are—is the Federal Reserve really taking enough risk to help households and businesses here, in that you just said that the programs that are out there  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL essentially lending only to those able to repay, which is essentially helping those who may need it the least?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, let me say again, in terms of—of asset purchases and—and other measures, we—we do think our—our policy stance is appropriate now.  We’ve had discussions, as I’ve mentioned, over time and done quite a bit of thinking about what we might do in the future.  We think, for now, our policy stance is appropriate.  We’re not going to change it now.  And we’re really waiting to see more from the economy.  There are a range of potential paths the economy could be on, and I think as—as the time approaches for—then we’ll—you know, we’ll address your first question, which is about asset purchases.  So—but that’s not something we’re doing today.  It’s—it’s something that we have talked about, and, you know, for now, we like our current policy stance. In terms of risk, so, you know, we operate under the laws that Congress passes.  And there are a number of aspects under section 13(3), and you can see that they’ve permitted us to, I think, move very quickly and move into areas where we’ve never been before and do so quite aggressively.  So I—I think we’re going places and providing help in places where we never have, and I’m glad that we are.  I think it’s appropriate that we are. Nonetheless, these are lending powers.  And if you read section 13(3) of the Dodd-Frank—or, the Federal Reserve Act, and I know you have, it does require that—that we be secured to our satisfaction, and—and we can’t lend to insolvent companies.  You know, it’s clear these are lending powers, and we are—we are ultimately bound to—to implement the laws that Congress gives us.  We—we do not make grants.  We can’t make grants.  And I—the reason I raised that in my remarks is that I just want to be clear on that.  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL We—you know, we can do what we can do, and we will do it to the absolute limit of those powers.  We will—we’ll keep at it.  And you—I just want people to know that we’ll—we will be at it with—with the legal authorities that we have until we get through this thing.  We will keep using our authorities.  But there are authorities that we don’t have, and there may be a need for those authorities to be used as well as ours. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Heather Long. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Hi.  Hi, Chair Powell, it’s Heather Long from the Washington Post.  I have two questions for you, both on timing.  The first, do you plan to launch the Corporate Credit Facility and the Main Street lending facilities in May or early May?  Anything you can give us—a sense on timing? And the second, in the statement, you referred today—the FOMC refers today to a lot of medium-term risks from the pandemic.  That sounds like you all think this is going to be a long recovery—a long road to recovery.  Can you give any more guidance on how you all see this recovery taking shape?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So, in terms of those facilities, the corporate credit facilities are near being finalized and will be operating, I would say, soon—fairly soon.  Main Street facility is—we’re close to announcing—to issuing a new term sheet.  As you know, we put out a term sheet for comment a while back, and we got a couple thousand comments.  We’ve carefully studied them.  We’ve tried to reflect those in what we’re doing now.  I think, with Main Street, there’ll be at least a couple of different kinds of lending going on there.  It—this is a broad area of the economy with many different kinds of credit needs, so we’re going to keep at that for some time, I think, adding in sectors and lending products.  So I think we’ll be at—we’ll  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL probably be continuing to work and expand Main Street for some time, but it won’t be done quite as quickly.  But the first part of it, I think, will be done fairly quickly. In terms of our statement, so what we said was that we—I’ll just read the sentence.  It says:  “[The] ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.”  So the “medium”—but what we meant by that, “over the medium term”—so, obviously, what we’re talking about is, you know, not right now, in the very near term.  It’s between now and the long term, so the next year or so.  And I would point to a couple of—of risks to the outlook that—what we were thinking of.  First is just the virus.  How long will it take to get it under control?  Will there be additional outbreaks?  Will there be drugs that can either treat it or—or a vaccine of some kind?  So there’s—all of that is very much shrouded in uncertainty. The second issue—and this is a very substantial one—is just the possibility of—of damage to the productive capacity of the economy through a couple of channels.  The first is just workers who—if one is unemployed for an extended period, that person can—can lose the skills that are needed, can lose touch with the labor force, and have difficulty restarting his or her career.  So that’s a—that’s a feature of deep and long recessions, and that’s something we’ve got to watch out for.  Another is just businesses—you know, these thousands of great medium- and small-sized businesses that we have all over the country.  They’re worth so much more to the economy than the sum of their net assets.  They contain—you know, they’re job creators, they’re really important.  And if we see an unnecessary—unnecessary insolvencies, a wave of those, that could be damaging to the performance of the economy over time.  So the good news is that we  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL have policies, as I mentioned in my remarks—we have policies that can address those things, but not perfectly.  So that’s—that’s another risk. The third thing I would point to is just the global dimension.  This is a very global phenomenon, and you are—we’re seeing economic data from around the globe which is very, very negative, and that, too, can weigh on U.S. economic performance over time.  I—you know, I would say, just on the U.S.—on the U.S. economy, there are things you can say, one can say.  The first is that, in the near term, we’re going to see, you know, significant declines in economic activity, significant declines in employment, and increases in unemployment.  We’re going to see that as a consequence of the virus and the measures we’re taking to protect ourselves from it. The next phases are more uncertain, highly uncertain, but we will go through a phase starting fairly soon where we begin to reopen the economy.  And probably the economic activity will pick up as consumer spending picks up.  Consumer spending, as I mentioned, has gone down quite a lot.  It’ll begin to pick up as people start to return to their normal patterns of spending.  But the chances are that it won’t go right back to where we were, because people will—until they’re confident of—that the virus is well and truly under control, then they will be somewhat probably reluctant to—to undertake certain kinds of activity.  So it may take some time for us to get back—it probably will take some time for us to get back to—you know, to a more normal level of unemployment and—and, ultimately, to maximum employment. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, James Politi. 

[SECTION]

JAMES POLITI.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  You didn’t firm up your guidance on—this is James Politi from the Financial Times—you didn’t firm up your guidance on interest rates at this meeting.  And given the risks that you just outlined, under what circumstances would you strengthen the Fed’s commitment to keep rates at the lower bound?  And is there any danger to  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL delaying—delaying that plan?  Then, on the credit facilities, what kind of demand are you expecting for the programs that were set up under the Cares Act, and are you expecting them to rapidly reach capacity like the PPP plan did? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  So on the first, as I mentioned, you know, we moved very quickly, very aggressively.  We were the first to return to the effective lower bound, where we are now.  We got there essentially right away, and we think that’s the right place to be.  We think, if you look at surveys, you look at market pricing, the market expects us to—to be there for a good while, and that’s appropriate.  So, you know, it’s not as though the market is pricing in a near-term liftoff or anything like that.  And let me just say, we’re going to not be in any hurry to withdraw these measures or to lift off.  We’re going to wait until we’re—we’re quite confident that the economy is—is well on the road to recovery.  So we don’t see—we see our current stance and our current guidance—and I would say the same thing about asset purchases—we see them as appropriate.  I’ve—I’ve also mentioned now a couple times that we have done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy might look like over coming months, and that would, you know, depend on—on where we are in—in a range of potential economic scenarios.  So we—we were thinking about that all the time, but right now, for now, we think our current stance is appropriate.  So we made no change in it today. Second question was, how—so the thing about our facilities is, Treasury still has plenty of equity.  So we’ve said that if—if demand for our facilities is greater than we’ve estimated, then we’ll expand them.  And we have the ability to do that.  So it won’t be the way the—the Paycheck Protection Program is, where there’s a specific amount allocated—appropriated for it, and—and then there’s no more money.  That’s—that will be unlikely to happen here unless we exhaust Treasury’s equity, and we’re a long way from doing that.  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL The second thing I would say is—and you’ve all seen this—is when we announce these facilities—and I mentioned this in my remarks—it’s not just the actual lending we do, it’s the—we build confidence in the market.  And private market participants come in.  And many companies that would’ve had to come to the Fed have now been able to finance themselves privately since we announced the—the initial term sheet on—on these facilities.  So that’s a good thing.  Companies are out there financing, they’re out there raising liquidity.  We haven’t made any corporate loans to—in those facilities.  We’ve made the short-term money market loans, but—we haven’t made any of them.  And yet there’s a tremendous amount of financing going on, and that’s a good thing. So we—for that reason, the ultimate demand for the facilities is quite difficult to predict, because there is this announcement effect that really gets the market functioning again.  Of course, we have to follow through, though.  And we will follow through to validate that—that announcement effect. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, Howard Schneider. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Oh, hi, Chair Powell, and thanks for doing this.  I wanted to get your—a little more expansion on the timing of recovery and the—the connection between the health response.  You said earlier, I think, that you thought the second half of the year could see a pretty robust rebound.  Is that now out of the question?  And do you think a steady recovery is really possible until a vaccine’s developed, given the patchwork of measures we’ve seen taken around the states?  Is that going to really lead us to a steady path out, absent a vaccine? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, as you know, economic forecasts are always uncertain.  Today they’re unusually uncertain, and that’s—that’s really because so much of the performance of the economy depends on the path of the virus and the success of the measures we take to  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL control it, our success in reopening the economy, and also the time it takes to develop new drugs.  And our tools, the things that we do, don’t affect any of those things.  We’re not experts on those things either, but what the experts tell us is that the outcomes are highly uncertain.  So this is an unusual, new kind of uncertainty added on top of our—our regular uncertainty. But I—I will say, there—I think there are a few things that you can say about—about the path ahead.  First, this time, now, is going to be a time of sharp contraction in economic activity, high unemployment.  Personal consumption expenditures have declined sharply, business investment as well.  Unemployment moved up.  We’re going to see economic data for the second quarter that’s worse than any data we’ve seen for the economy.  And they’re a direct consequence of the disease and the measures that we’re taking to protect ourselves from it. So then we will enter this new phase, and we—we’re just beginning to maybe do that, where we will—formal measures that require social distancing will be rolled back gradually and at different paces in different parts of the country.  And, in time, this—during this period, the economy will begin to recover.  People will come out of their homes, start to spend again.  We’ll see unemployment go down, we’ll see economic activity pick up.  And, you know, when will that be?  It’s very hard to say.  But let’s just say, for this purpose, that it’s in the third quarter.  So, as I mentioned earlier, that—that could be a fairly, you know, a large increase.  Given the—given the size of the fall, the increase could also be substantially large, although it’s unlikely that it would bring us quickly, quickly all the way back to pre-crisis levels.  Of course, this is the period as well that carries the risk of new outbreaks of the virus, something we really want to I think then, after that period, at some point you will have—you know, the kind of formal social-distancing measures will—will be gone, but you’ll still be left with, probably, a level of avoid.  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL caution on the part of people who will—who will worry and probably keep worrying for some—for some time.  You would think that behavior will change as people gain confidence.  So the—the sooner we get the virus under control, the sooner people can regain that confidence and regain their economic activity.  I think trying to be really precise about when that might happen and what the numbers might look like is—I think it’s very tough to do that. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, Steve Matthews. 

[SECTION]

STEVE MATTHEWS.  Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.  Chairman Powell, you’ve noted a number of times over the last year that there’s been a broadening out of job gains with finally making job gains, and—particularly minorities, but also many other workers.  Do you worry that this recession is going to fall hardest on those workers who’ve struggled and just got job gains in the last year or two, and that it may take years from now before there are opportunities for them again? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  That’s exactly what I worry about.  So unemployment has tended to go up much faster for minorities and for others who are—tend to be at the low end of the income spectrum.  And it tends to come down—come down faster as well, but it tends to go up faster and be much, much higher.  And we were in a place—only two months ago, we were well into—beginning the second half of the 11th year is where we were, and every reason to think that it was ongoing.  We were hearing from minority—low- and moderate-income and minority communities that this was the best labor market they’d seen in their lifetime.  All the data supported that as well.  And it is heartbreaking, frankly, to see that all threatened now.  All the more need for our urgent response—and also that of Congress, which has been urgent and large—and to do what we can to avoid longer-run damage to the economy, which is what I—I  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL mentioned earlier.  This is an exogenous event that—you know, just, it happened to us.  It wasn’t because there was something wrong with the economy.  And I think it is important that we do everything we can to avoid that longer-run damage and try to get back to where we were, because I do very much have that concern.  I think everyone is suffering here, but I think those who are least able to—to bear it are the ones who are, you know, losing their jobs and losing their incomes and have little cushion to—you know, to protect them in times like that.  So, yes, that’s a very big concern. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, I’m Victoria Guida with Politico.  The Paycheck Protection Program has experienced some logistical problems because of the speed at which all of this is happening.  For the Main Street lending facilities, which will also work through banks, what lessons are you taking away from that?  And then, more broadly, you know, you mentioned earlier this year that the federal debt was on an unsustainable path.  And I was just wondering, for Republicans that are starting to get worried about how much fiscal spending they’re having to do in this crisis, you know, whether that should be a concern for them.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So a couple things.  This is different from the PPP, the Paycheck Protection Program, in two ways.  One is, these are not grants, these are loans.  So I don’t know that the demand will be quite as strong as—as it has been for the PPP.  I don’t know that.  And the second thing is, we won’t run out of money.  You know, it’s not a limited pot, so there won’t be this incentive to try to get there first and that sort of thing.  So I’m—I’m hopeful we—we will very much try to learn as much as possible from that facility and from all the other ones, too.  We have a lot to learn here, so we’ll certainly be trying to do that.  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL In terms of fiscal concern, so  I—you know, I’m—for many years, I’ve been, before the Fed, I have longtime been an advocate for the need for the United States to return to a sustainable path from a fiscal perspective at the federal level.  We have not been on such a path for some time, which means—just means that the debt is growing faster than the economy.  This is not the time to act on those concerns.  This is the time to use the great fiscal power of the United States to—to do what we can to support the economy and try to get through this with as little damage to the longer-run productive capacity of the economy as possible. The time will come again—and reasonably soon, I think—where we can—where we can think about a long-term way to get our fiscal house in order.  And we absolutely need to do that.  But this is not the time to be—in my personal view, this is not the time to—to let that concern, which is a very serious concern, but—to let that get in the way of us winning this battle, really. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, Edward Lawrence.  

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Oh, yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.  Now, given the amount of stimulus on the fiscal side and monetary policy side, how much weight do you give to finding a vaccine, from clearing that uncertainty you talked about around treatment and whatnot, for the Federal Reserve pulling back on some of the Fed’s actions and raising the rates from the zero lower bound?  Also, when does that Main Street lending facility get deployed?  Because you talked about “soon”—you know, some businesses are in need now.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so we don’t—we’re not in a position to make, you know, a reliable assessment of when a vaccine or a therapeutic drug would be ready, and so we’re not going to set our policies based on—on our estimate of that.  We’re going to just provide the  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL support that we can with the tools that we have, and we’re going to keep doing that until—until the recovery’s well under way. In terms of Main Street, so you know the story.  We put out a term sheet, we got a lot of comments, we took those very much to heart.  We’ve spent a great deal of time here.  It’s a challenging space, because it’s many different kinds of borrowers—they have different needs, different sizes of companies.  And so, we’re—as I mentioned, we’re very close to announcing a new term sheet, which will then become operative fairly quickly.  My guess is, though, that we’ll keep—we’ll keep looking to add products and add different kinds of borrowers to that as we go.  And we’re—we’re well aware of the importance of—of doing it as quickly as possible.  We, here, you know, we’re very much in touch with—with the urgency of that need. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, Don Lee. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Chair Powell, it’s Don Lee from the L.A. Times.  I just wanted to follow up on a question—the question on the labor market.  I know you said that it’s highly uncertain but, you know, there are analysts who think that we’ll have very high unemployment until even the end of next year, as high as 9 percent.  And, at this point, what—can you just talk a little bit more about what you see as the path of employment in the coming months and into next year? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So unemployment’s going to go up to a high number in the second quarter—uncertain what the number will be.  When—and that’s because so much economic activity has been shuttered, really, as we take social-distancing measures.  And the—so sometime fairly soon here, and probably gradually and at different paces at different parts of the country, we’ll see the social-distancing measures rolled back.  People will begin to spend more money.  It’s, really, consumer spending has fallen precipitously.  And once that starts to happen, people will get hired back and unemployment will go back down.  I don’t think it’ll get  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL anywhere near the historically low levels that we had in—as recently as February, 3½ percent.  I think it will take some time for that to happen, for us to get back to anything that resembles maximum employment. But, I mean, the main thing we want is, we want to get back on that road.  We want to get that—that recovery going and get people back to work as fast as we can.  Not faster than we can, but as fast as we can.  The main thing is to get into that stage where the economy’s healing, where we have the disease under control, where we don’t, you know, take too much risk of—of second and third waves and that sort of thing, and get people back to work.  And, you know, it’s—again, the path of it is highly uncertain, but we will—we will be there with our tools, supporting the economy and supporting that recovery. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Scott Horsley. 

[SECTION]

SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  After the financial crisis, banks were instructed to up their capital so they could weather an economic shock.  What kind of steps do you think we need to take for the economy writ large to make it more resilient to this kind of shock? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Can you just say that part—you’re a little bit low volume. 

[SECTION]

SCOTT HORSLEY.  Yes.  What kind of steps could we take to help the economy as a whole be more resilient to this kind of exogenous shock? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, it’s an extraordinary, extraordinary shock, unlike anything, certainly, that’s happened in my lifetime.  And a couple things come to mind.  I—I think the time will come for a careful assessment of the answers to those questions.  It’s early to be asking them.  We’re still putting out the fire.  We’re still trying to win.  And I think we’ll be at that for a while.  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL You know, but I’d point to a couple of directions.  You know, we worked hard to strengthen the banks:  much higher levels of capital, liquidity, far greater sense of what the risks are they’re running and how to manage them.  So the breakdowns that we’ve seen in market function have really been in the capital markets.  And I don’t—I wouldn’t rush in with prudential regulation into the capital markets.  But I think—and we did plenty of things—you know, triparty—you know, we did a lot of reform in the capital markets:  money market reform, triparty repo reform, central clearing, all these important things.  But there—there will no doubt be—with this—the size and force of this shock will no doubt reveal weaknesses in the financial architecture, and we’ll have to go to work on those. I—I also think it—you know, it tells you the importance of—of getting your fiscal house in order.  The U.S. really hadn’t—really hadn’t gotten back to where we needed to get on fiscal policy.  And, you know, so we—we had an already high level of debt to GDP, and rising quickly, when this shock arrived.  Now, we have the fiscal capacity to deal with it, I believe.  But we will need to—ideally, you would go into an unexpected shock like this with a—with a much stronger fiscal—fiscal posture.

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, given the demand drop, demand shock, and the drop in oil prices, do you anticipate that we might see any kind of deflation, even for a very short period, that would require a Fed response?  If we get a negative print on CPI or PCE, how should people think about that? And second question—there is a disconnect, it appears, between the markets and the economic outlook right now.  And I know you said that this isn’t the time to worry about moral  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL hazard, but do you worry, with the size of stimulus that you and the Congress are putting into the economy, there could be financial stability problems as this goes along? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  In terms of inflation, we think that inflation is very closely and strongly related to inflation expectations.  And during the Global Financial Crisis, there was a concern that we might see deflation, but it didn’t happen.  Inflation expect—inflation tended to move down a little bit, as it will when demand is weak.  And—but inflation expectations did not move strongly down here in the United States.  They have in other places in the world, though, over the past 25 years.  There’s been downward pressure on inflation, really, for several So, I would say, as long as inflation expectations remain anchored, then we shouldn’t see deflation.  And the Federal Reserve is strongly committed to maintaining 2 percent inflation over time.  So we’ll be there to work on that.  I think you asked, really, about headline inflation.  If—if low energy prices—very low energy prices were to—were to drop headline inflation negative, I—I would hope that people would see through that—and we’ll be monitoring it very carefully—would see through it, though, and look to core, which is a better predictor of future inflation.  So, needless to say, we’ll be keeping very close track of that. In terms of the markets, you know, our—our concern is that they be working.  We’re not—we’re not focused on the level of asset prices in particular, it’s just—markets are trying to price in something that is so uncertain as to be unknowable, which is the path of this virus globally and its effect on the economy.  And that’s very, very hard to do.  That’s why you see volatility the way it’s been, market reacting to—to things with a lot of volatility.  But, you know, what we’re trying to assure, really, is that the market is working.  The market is assessing risks, lenders are lending, borrowers are borrowing, asset prices are moving in response to events.   April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL That’s—that is really important for everybody, including—including, you know, the—the most vulnerable among us, because if—if markets stop working and credit stops flowing, then you see—that’s when you see, you know, very sharp negative—even more negative economic outcomes. So I think our measures have—have supported market function pretty well.  You know, we’re going to stay very careful, carefully monitoring that.  But I think it’s been good to see as businesses have been able to build up their liquidity buffers and households have been able to be home—you know, people have been home, you know, concerned about their jobs, but they’re not concerned about the financial system collapsing as they were in 2008 and ’09. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, Chris from the AP. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Chris Rugaber over at AP, thank you.  I guess I had two questions.  I wanted to start on the unemployment picture and nail down a little bit how you see—how you see things going from here.  You did talk about potential loss of skills over time.  So are you worried about structural changes in job markets that would keep unemployment high and, therefore, potentially beyond the ability of the Fed to do anything about, which is something that was debated, as you know, after the last recession, and then eventually, of course, the unemployment rate did go lower than people thought? Second question is just on the money from Treasury, the $454 billion.  It sounds like you want to keep that in reserve for programs that have high demand, such as the Main Street program.  Are you willing to use that to backstop, say, a program that is having more losses?  I mean, you know, what’s your tolerance for loss among that $454 billion?  Thank you.  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, in terms of the labor market, the—the risk to—of damage to people’s skills and their careers and their lives is a function of time to some extent.  So the longer one is unemployed, the harder it gets, I think—and we’ve probably all seen this in our lives—the harder it is to get back into the workforce and get back to where you were, if you ever do get back to where you were.  So, you know, longer and deeper downturns have had—have left more of a mark, generally, in that dimension with the labor force.  And so that’s why—as I mentioned, that’s why the urgency in doing what we can to prevent that longer-run damage.  It doesn’t have to be that way.  We won’t be able to limit all of it, but we do have the tools to—to do what we can to—to keep people in touch with the labor force and working and also out of insolvency, too.  It doesn’t seem fair that people should lose everything they have, including their homes, over this.  So, nonetheless, there will be some of that.  But we do have some tools to ameliorate that. In terms of the—so in terms of the—the money, you know, the $454 billion, it’s a couple things.  First, the Treasury Secretary really has—has authority over that, right?  And it stands in front of our losses.  So, you know—but I do think we are—we’re clearly moving into areas where there is more risk than there has been in the past.  And that’s okay.  I think that’s what we’re supposed to do.  This is—this is a very unusual time.  And so—but in terms of the—of the way to think about that money, I think that’s really a question for the Treasury Department.  You know, we are—we set up the facilities, and we work very, very closely and successfully and collaboratively with the Treasury on this, but that—that particular aspect of it falls more to the Secretary. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we’ll go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer for the last question. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, I’m wondering what you would say to savers who are hurt by very low interest rates and  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL I’m wondering if you can give us any more of a clue as to how long you think we’re going to have interest rates near zero.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we think that low interest rates affect the economy through a number of channels in a positive way.  Lower interest rates support economic activity through channels that we—overall, through channels that we understand reasonably well.  They make it cheaper to borrow, they make—they drive, you know, your costs of borrowing down.  They do—they do raise asset prices, including the value of your home.  If your saver owns a home or has a 401(k), your saver will benefit from that.  But for people who are really, really just relying on their bank savings account earnings, this is—you know, that’s—that’s—you’re not going to benefit from low interest rates. But we—you know, we have to look out for the overall economy.  Low interest rates support employment, they support economic activity, and those are our mandates.  And I think for the overall good of the economy, low interest rates are a good thing.  And that’s not to say they’re good for every single person, but that shouldn’t stop us from doing what we think is—is good for the whole. thinking about. In terms of how low, I really don’t want to speculate.  You know, we will turn to questions like that soon enough.  But the—in terms of how long we’ll stay and under what conditions we’ll stay at the effective lower bound, those are just exactly the things we’re Right now we like the place we are.  We’ve said that we’ll keep our rates where they are until we’re confident that the economy has weathered the effects of the outbreak and is on track to achieve our—our goals.  So that’s where we are.  We’re leaving—we’re not changing that  April 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL guidance today, you know, but it’ll be—that means we’re going to be very patient.  That means we’re—we’re not going to be in any hurry to move rates up.

CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
36,2020-06-10,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us.  Our country continues to face a difficult and challenging time, as the pandemic is causing tremendous hardship here in the United States and around the world.  People have lost loved ones.  Many millions have lost their jobs.  There is great uncertainty about the future.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to using our tools to do whatever we can—and for as long as it takes—to provide some relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. The most important response to this crisis has come from our health-care workers.  And on behalf of the Federal Reserve, let me express our sincere gratitude to those dedicated individuals who put themselves at risk, day after day, in service to others and to our nation.  Let me also thank the many other essential workers across the country who have helped meet our basic needs for goods and services in these difficult times. The virus and the forceful measures taken to control its spread have induced a sharp plummeted in April, and the decline in real GDP in the current quarter is likely to be the most severe on record.  Even after the unexpectedly positive May employment report, nearly 20 million jobs have been lost on net since February, and the unemployment rate has risen about 10 percentage points, to 13.3 percent.  As was highlighted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this figure likely understates the extent of unemployment; accounting for the unusually large number of workers who reported themselves as employed but absent from their jobs would raise the unemployment rate by about 3 percentage points.  The downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the most affected.  In   June 10, 2020  particular, the rise in joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers, for women,   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   and for African Americans and Hispanics. In recent weeks, some indicators suggest a stabilization or even a modest rebound in some segments of the economy, such as retail merchandise and motor vehicle sales.  Employment rose in many sectors of the economy in May, and the unemployment [rate] edged down as some workers returned to their jobs from temporary layoffs.  With the easing of social-distancing restrictions across the country, people are increasingly moving about, and many businesses are resuming operations to varying degrees.  At the same time, many households have been receiving stimulus payments and unemployment benefits, which are supporting incomes and spending.  Activity in many parts of the economy has yet to pick up, however, and overall output is far below earlier levels.  Moreover, despite the improvements seen in the May jobs report, unemployment remains historically high. Weak demand, especially in sectors most affected by the pandemic, is holding down consumer prices.  As a result, inflation has fallen well below our symmetric 2 percent objective.  Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have been fairly steady. The extent of the downturn and the pace of recovery remain extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in containing the virus.  We all want to get back to normal, but a full recovery is unlikely to occur until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.  The severity of the downturn will also depend on the policy actions taken at all levels of government to provide relief and to support the recovery when the public health crisis passes. The Fed’s response is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of  June 10, 2020  the financial system.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   in this challenging time.  In March, we quickly lowered our policy interest rate to near zero, where we expect to keep it until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. We have also been taking broad and forceful actions to support the flow of credit in the economy.  Without access to credit, families could be forced to cut back on necessities or even lose their homes.  Businesses could be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further losses of jobs and incomes and worsening the downturn.  Preserving the flow of credit is thus essential for mitigating the damage to the economy and setting the stage for the recovery. Since March, we have been purchasing sizable quantities of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities in order to support the smooth functioning of these markets, which are vital to the flow of credit in the economy.  Our ongoing purchases have helped to restore orderly market conditions and have fostered more accommodative financial conditions.  As reduced the pace of these purchases.  To sustain smooth market functioning and thereby foster the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we will increase our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities over coming months at least at the current pace.  We will closely monitor developments and are prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate to support our goals. The Federal Reserve is also undertaking programs to provide stability to the financial system and to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy—for households, for businesses of all sizes, and for state and local governments.  These programs benefit the economy by providing financing where it is not otherwise available.  In addition, by serving as a  June 10, 2020  backstop to key credit markets, the programs can increase the willingness of private lenders to   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL extend credit.  Many of these programs rely on emergency lending powers that are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as these—those we find ourselves in today.  We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and from the Treasury.  We will continue to use these powers forcefully, proactively, and aggressively until we’re confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery.  When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox. I would stress that these are lending powers, not spending powers.  The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.  We can only create programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entity—entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid.  Many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy.  But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer.  In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.  Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources.  The 

[SECTION]

CARES Act and other legislation provide direct help to people and businesses and communities.  This direct support can make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy. At this meeting, my colleagues and I continued our discussion of approaches for conducting monetary policy when the federal funds rate is at its lower bound.  The measures we discussed included explicit forms of forward guidance and asset purchases.  We used these tools in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, and they have become a standard part of our toolkit.  We also reviewed the historical and foreign experience with targeting interest rates  June 10, 2020  along the yield curve.  Whether such an approach would usefully complement our main tools   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL remains an open question.  We will continue our discussions in upcoming meetings and will evaluate our monetary policy stance and communications as more information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available. We also resumed our regular quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, or the SEP.  The SEP is an input into our deliberations, not an outcome, and it does not represent a Committee view.  Rather, FOMC participants write down their individual views of the most likely path for the economy, conditioned on each participant’s view of appropriate monetary policy.  We tabulate those submissions, and we publish them as the SEP.  Given the unusually high level of uncertainty about the outlook, many participants noted that they see a number of reasonably likely paths for the economy, and that it’s not possible to identify with confidence a single path as the “most likely” one.  Nonetheless, we believe that regular publication of the SEP provides a useful perspective on the way FOMC participants are assessing the path ahead. What the June SEP shows is a general expectation of an economic recovery beginning in the second half of this year and lasting over the next couple of years, supported by interest rates that remain at their current level, near zero.  Of course, my colleagues and I will continue to base our policy decisions on the full range of plausible outcomes and not on a particular forecast.  The risk-management approach—this risk-management approach is the best way we can promote our maximum-employment and price-stability goals in these unusually uncertain circumstances. Finally, I want to acknowledge the tragic events that have again put a spotlight on the pain of racial injustice in this country.  The Federal Reserve serves the entire nation.  We operate in, and are part of, many of the communities across the country where Americans are grappling with and expressing themselves on issues of racial equality.  I speak for my colleagues  June 10, 2020  throughout the Federal Reserve System when I say that there is no place at the Federal Reserve   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL for racism and there should be no place for it in our society.  Everyone deserves the opportunity to participate fully in our society and in our economy. These principles guide us in all we do, from monetary policy to our focus on diversity and inclusion in our workplace and to our work to ensure fair access to credit across the country.  We will take this opportunity to renew our steadfast commitment to these principles.  We understand that the work of the Fed touches communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible. Thank you.  I look forward to our questions. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  For the first question, Nick Timiraos. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Yes, hi.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.  I want to ask about the economic projections, and I realize these are more of an educated guess at this point, but they suggest the Committee sees quite a large output gap over the next two years.  And yet the Committee did not take any steps to date to—to reinforce your forward guidance.  And so my questions are, first, what are you hoping to learn by waiting?  Second, how might that change your response?  And, third, how close is the Committee to reaching a decision on a—a more concrete forward guidance and whether yield caps might reinforce that guidance? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, first, I would say that we think that monetary policy today is currently well positioned to support the economy in this challenging time.  If we didn’t think that, of course, we would change our policy now.  As you know, we—we lowered our policy rate  June 10, 2020  very quickly, [more] quickly than others, to the effective lower bound.  And we’ve said that   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL we’ll keep it there until the economy has weathered the effects of the virus and is on track to achieve our goals.  You can see that in—in the dot plot, as I think you pointed out, that overwhelmingly, FOMC participants expect, as their baseline expectation, no rate increase at least through 2022.  And if you look at surveys of more forecasters and market participants, financial market prices, et cetera, those also appropriately reflect a long spell with rates at the effective lower bound. So the first thing is, monetary policy is in a good place, and it’s—that’s well understood in the markets.  Secondly, we’ve also taken strong measures to support the flow of credit in the economy, as I mentioned.  And, third, we’re continuing asset prices in coming months at—at a—at a relatively high level.1  So for all those reasons, we feel like policy is now in a good place.  So as we look ahead, we see that the path for the—ahead for the economy is highly uncertain and continues to depend to a really significant degree on the path of the pandemic. So, at this meeting, what we did was, as I mentioned, we—we looked in some depth at forward guidance and asset purchases and looked carefully at those.  We also received a briefing on the historical experience with yield curve control.  And we’ll continue those discussions in upcoming meetings and evaluate our stance and communications as more and portion—more—more information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available.  I—I would just say, in terms of—of what we’re looking for, we—we expect to get a better understanding of the economy’s trajectory and, particularly, how we should best deploy those tools to achieve those goals.  So that’s really what we’re looking to achieve, and, as you can see, we’re—we’re actively at work on that.                                                  1 Chair Powell intended to say “asset purchases” rather than “asset prices.”  June 10, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Next, Jeanna. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you so much for taking our questions.  I’m—I’m curious about your inflation forecasts, which are—are pretty low across the forecast horizon.  I guess just given how low you see inflation being over the coming years, why is policy appropriate now, and why not just kind of throw everything you can—you know, everything and the kitchen sink at it currently?  And I guess if you could just talk a little bit about what urgency you see in—in returning it back to that 2 percent target. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Our current policy stance is appropriate.  And remember, we’re using—we’re using our—our emergency 13(3) lending tools to an unprecedented extent.  We have asset purchases, and we’ve now said that we won’t go any lower than this, and—but—but that we’re prepared to adjust as appropriate, and rates are at the effective lower bound.  So we have all of our tools in—in use in a strong way.  And so what we’re—what we’re waiting for is to—is to learn more.  I—I think, actually, if you look at the May employment report, it’s a pretty good—probably the biggest data surprise that anybody can remember.  It’s a pretty good illustration of just how uncertain these times are.  The economy is reopening.  We’re going to learn a whole lot about the—the path of the economy in the next—in coming months.  So that’s really what we’re—what we’re looking for. In terms of inflation, you’ll know that we—we had a 128-month expansion, and we never did quite get inflation back to 2 percent on a symmetric, sustained basis.  We got close for the last couple of years, but we never did quite get there.  So I think we have to be humble about our ability to move inflation up and particularly when unemployment is—is going to be above most estimates of the natural rate for—certainly above the median in our—in our—in our SEP well through the end of—past the end of 2022.  So I do—I think we’re in the right place now.  We— June 10, 2020  we are looking carefully at what the—as we learn more and—and better understand the—the   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL path of the economy, we will be assessing, what’s the best way to deploy all of our tools to achieve our goals in the best possible way? And I’ll—I’ll just say again that we are—the—the May employment report, of course, was a—was a welcome surprise, very pleased.  We hope we get many more like it.  But I think we have to be honest.  It’s a—it’s a long road.  It’s—it’s, depending on how you count it, well more than 20 million people displaced in the labor market.  It’s going to take some time.  And we are going to be deploying our tools—all of our tools, to their full extent, in pursuit of that—of those goals, however long it takes. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Steve Liesman. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think I understand how the Fed might react in the event things come out worse than expected.  I think I don’t understand how you might react if things come out better than expected—kind of a variant on these other questions.  How firm is the commitment to lower interest rates?  And if things end up better, do you stick with these low interest rates, as you—as you projected them?  And—or is it specific points that you have in mind—for example, unemployment or inflation—that is animating where you might go?  And what are those numbers that you’re looking for that might cause you to change about the policy as it now is projected? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I would start with—that’s where I would start.  I would say, you know, we were—we just had a period of unemployment, as you know, that was in the—well below 4 percent, hanging around 3½ percent, that lasted two years.  And during that period of time, we saw a lot of great things happening in the labor market, things that we’d love to get back to.  We didn’t see any problems with price inflation.  Price inflation didn’t really react  June 10, 2020  much.  So, I would say, you know, we’d be looking to get inflation back up, and we—we’d be   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL prepared to tolerate pretty low—welcome, in fact, not tolerate but welcome very low readings on—on unemployment just based on what we—what we saw in the last—in the last expansion. So, you know, we’re—we’re not thinking about raising rates.  We’re not even thinking about thinking about raising rates.  So what we’re thinking about is—is providing support for this economy.  We do think this is going to take some time.  I think most forecasters believe that.  It would be great if—if we got a whole bunch more months of job creation like that.  Not—notwithstanding that, as I mentioned, there are—there are just a lot of people that are unemployed.  And it seems quite likely that there will be a significant group at the end of—even—even after a lot of strong job growth, that’ll still be struggling to find jobs, and we’ll still be providing strong accommodation for that. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, thank you.  James. 

[SECTION]

JAMES POLITI.  Thanks very much, Chair Powell.  There have been plenty of comparisons with the Great Depression of the 1930s since the crisis began.  I mean, is that scenario sort of got[ten] more dire as data comes out and we’re looking at a more traditional and sudden recession?  And are you at all concerned that the performance—the strong performance in the stock market in the last few weeks is disconnected from economic reality? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I don’t think that the—that the Great Depression is a good example or a likely outcome or a model for what’s happening here at all.  I really don’t.  And there—there are just so many fundamental differences.  First, the government response has been so fast and so forceful.  The origin was quite different.  This was a very—an economy that was in a healthy place.  Of course, every economy has longer-run challenges, not—and that—that includes our economy, notwithstanding that 50-year low in unemployment and the longest expansion in our  June 10, 2020  history and every reason to think it could continue.  So that’s different from what was happening   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   around the time of the Great—the Depression started.  The financial system this time was in—was in—was in very good shape, much better capitalized.  So, you know, it’s just not the right model. I would say, we’re learning.  You know, every month that passes, we’re seeing more, we’re learning more.  And I think particularly the next few months will be very important in learning what the—what the real story will be, because we’ll see the—the significant incoming data about the opening of the economy—the reopening of the economy.  You know—and I would say, assuming that the—that the—that the disease remains or becomes pretty much under control, I think that what you see is a—is a very weak second quarter, historically weak, and then an—an expansion that builds momentum over time. People will adjust, probably a little bit gradually, to some of the activities that would—that involve getting together in small—in large groups in close quarters.  Those will be the harder parts of the economy to recover.  But, ultimately, we do see a full recovery over time.  And that’s really what, you know, what I think I’m—I’m personally seeing.  And you could see significant job growth in—in coming months as people return to their jobs, but you’re still going to face probably an extended period where it will be difficult for many people to find work.  And for—and that’s what you see in—in—in, really, many, many forecasts at this point.  That doesn’t mean it’s right, but that’s sort of a—a broad expectation, certainly not the Depression forecast. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Chris from the Associated Press. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi.  Thank you for taking our questions.  Well, in the projections you have—you didn’t change the—the Fed policymakers didn’t change their—the forecast for long-run unemployment, so that suggests that you—you know, the—that all of you  June 10, 2020  so far don’t see necessarily prospects for long-term damage.  But still, what kind of data are you   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   looking at here to gauge, you know, the potential for longer-term hits to the economy even as we have some of these—even as we have something like the May jobs report, you could still have, at the same time, people return from temporary layoffs, there could still be permanent job losses?  So what kind of data are you looking at to gauge that potential impact, and what is—what is it telling us so far? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Chris, this is a really important risk.  And I think it’s—it’s not the risk for the next few months, but it’s the risk over time of—of lasting damage to the—to these—you know, to the productive capacity of the United States, typically in two forms.  One, through extended periods of unemployment, people lose contact with the labor force.  They get out of touch with the skills and—that they need, and—and they have a hard time getting back in, and that drives that—that, you know, it’s very damaging to people’s lives and their working lives.  And it also just lowers, in a way—it can—it can increase the—you know, the unemployment rate, but it can also lower the labor force participation rate, which is almost worse, in a way, to have people dropping out of the labor force where we need them in the—in the labor force working. The other piece of it is just businesses.  You know, a shock like this that just comes in, it’s like a natural disaster.  You wouldn’t want a lot of perfectly good businesses, particularly the smaller and medium-sized businesses that may not have a lot of resources to sustain them to—you know, to go out of business permanently in a situation like that—like this where, really, there was no reason for it.  Of course, you know, businesses are going to go in and out.  They’re going to fail all the time, and that’s a healthy thing in capitalism.  That’s something that has to  June 10, 2020  happen.  But this is different.  This is a way—potentially—so those are the things we’ve been   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL worried about. We didn’t change.  You—you’re right, though.  We didn’t change our longer-run estimate of—of potential growth or of the unemployment rate.  And that’s—I would say, in my thinking, the reason I didn’t change mine is that I still—I—I think we can avoid that or avoid much of that, most of that even.  And—and we do that with measures that—that, you know, keep people in their homes; that—that support hiring; that support growth; that avoid unnecessary, avoidable business insolvencies.  And that’s all the things that we’re trying to do.  Basically, if you look at what’s happened, as I mentioned, there’s something—somewhere short of 25 million people have been displaced, even after the good May employment report.  What we’re trying to do is create an environment in which they have the best chance either to go back to their old job or to get a new job.  That’s—that’s kind of the most important part of this exercise. And maybe these—it’s probably hopeful at this point to say that—that we won’t have longer-run damage to the economy, and these numbers won’t change.  So—but I think it’s way too early to be—to be changing the longer run—see, these are—these are not meant to be short-run numbers.  They’re called—they’re longer-run assessments, so I—I would—I have not changed mine, and I’m hopeful that—that I won’t have to change it.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Heather Long. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG.  Hi.  Good afternoon, Chair Powell.  I’m struggling with two things that I hope you can provide some clarity on.  The first is the ongoing bond buying program.  You say that it’s needed to continue the smooth functioning of markets, but I guess most of us aren’t really seeing a lot of instability in markets right now.  So if you could kind of give us some clarity of what you’re seeing that needs to continue to be smooth at that level and that pace.   June 10, 2020  Second is, you know, you were just talking about Fed concerns about small and medium-sized   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL companies going out of business during this.  And, I guess, you know, the Main Street Lending Program still isn’t running yet.  When do you expect loans to start happening?  And do you think the two-month delay has—has hurt the chances of some companies surviving? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  There have been gains in market function, although not fully back to where you would say they were, for example, in—in February, before the pandemic arrived.  We don’t take those gains for granted, though.  This is a—this is a highly fluid situation, and we’re—we’re not taking those for granted.  And, in addition, as I pointed out in my—in my statement, those purchases are clearly also supporting highly accommodative—or accommodative financial conditions, and that’s—that’s a good thing, so that’s why we’re doing that. Turning quickly to Main Street, so I would say that the thing—what we’ve done on Main Street, I think to a greater degree, is, we’ve listened to feedback.  So we’ve been out repeatedly for feedback in trying to create a—a much more difficult product than, really, the other facilities.  And I think this—this last set of changes we made have actually been very positive for the facility.  I think it’s going to be better able to achieve its goals, and, you know, so we’ve used the time well, I think. And that—we are now in the—in the—in the final run-up to starting the facility.  What we did, as you saw earlier—I guess it’s early this week or late, whenever we did it in the last few days—was we lowered the minimum loan size and we increased the maximum loan size.  But, I think, even more importantly, we lengthened the maturity and we stretched out the repayment schedule significantly.  So borrowers will get a—a two-year delay until they have to make any principal payments—repayments and a one-year delay on interest.  So we had been hearing from  June 10, 2020  both borrowers and lenders that these would be very helpful.  We made the changes.  We’re   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL putting them through the facility. The next step will be to register lenders.  At that time, loans can begin to be made.  Shortly after that, the facility itself will be up, and those facilities can be—those loans can be sold—95 percent of the loans.  And it’s 95 percent across the board now in the Main Street facility can be sold.  So all of that should happen quickly now.  And I do think this has—this has been a challenging project, but I think we’ve come to a—to a better place.  And, by the way, we’re—we’re going to be prepared to adapt further, if we need to.  And—and that’s true of all of our facilities.  These are unique.  There’s no—there’s no playbook here.  You—you have to draw this up and then try it out.  And we’ve—we’ve been, you know, very willing to adapt and will continue to be. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, Matt from Bloomberg. 

[SECTION]

MATTHEW BOESLER.  Hello, Chair Powell.  This is Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News.  I wanted to ask you about regulatory forbearance.  There were some piecemeal forbearance measures put into place in various jurisdictions and also to a slice of the mortgage caused by the pandemic.  And with many of those set to expire soon and many businesses and households still in dire financial straits, I’m wondering if any consideration is being given at the Fed to more comprehensive regulatory forbearance measures or other regulatory measures to prevent businesses from going under just because they can’t meet those payments.  There have, of course, been some tweaks to the Paycheck Protection Program on the fiscal side to address this, but I wanted to ask you about things you might be able to do on the regulatory side as well.  Thank you.  June 10, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We can—we can make changes to bank regulation and supervision.  I don’t know that we have the ability to make changes, for example, in mortgage payments, if that’s what you’re thinking of, or credit card payments.  That’s really—that’s something that could be legislative, or it could just be what the—what the banks themselves are doing.  There’s been a tremendous amount of forbearance on the part of the banks, and I guess our role there would be to encourage it, but those are not decisions that we hold any legal authority to make, and we—by the way, we have encouraged those decisions.  I hope that’s responsive to your question. 

[SECTION]

  MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Scott Horsley, NPR. 

[SECTION]

SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I know you’re loathe to weigh in too heavily on fiscal policy, but given your forecast for elevated unemployment rates, do you think it’s important that Congress extend the $600 a week extra unemployment benefits? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I think we try to keep our comments on fiscal policy at a high level, and I’ll—I’ll come to your specific question, but I would just say this:  This is the biggest economic shock in the U.S. and in the world, really, in living memory.  We went from the lowest level of employ—unemployment in 50 years to the highest level in close to 90 years, and we did it in two months.  Extraordinary.  And, appropriately, the response from fiscal authorities has been large, forceful, and very quick by—by the standards of these things.  Roughly $3 trillion Congress has authorized, and that’s benefiting households; laid-off workers; small, medium, and large businesses; hospitals; state and local governments—14 percent of GDP.  It is—it’s in a class by itself, in terms of both the size and the speed of it, and it’s also pretty innovative. You know, the—both the PPP and the unemployment insurance are quite innovative in the American context, and there were difficulties in implementing it, but that’s really a function  June 10, 2020  of—of their novelty, I think.  Those programs—by the way, let me add:  The Fed also—we both   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   innovated and acted forcefully, progressively, proactively, and aggressively as well.  If you put those together, all of that is making a difference now.  You look at the income data.  The expanded unemployment insurance and also the stimulus checks have gone a long way to replacing lost income from—from job loss.  I think you’re seeing it in the job market data.  Many are giving the PPP credit on that front and—and in keeping small businesses going.  So it’s—so far, it’s a good response, and it’s having—it’s having a big effect.  You—you get to—the question is, it’s big—everyone can see that it’s big.  Is it going to be big enough?  And that—that is the question.  And—and the question for—for—the question that I’ve been concerned about, really, is this issue of longer-run damage to the economy. We’re—we’re—we’re doing a fair job of getting through these first few months, more than a fair job.  The question, though, is, that group of people who won’t be able to go back to work quickly, what about them?  And that could be many millions of people, you know, parts—who worked in parts of the economy that will be the slow ones to recover.  And, you know, we want those people back in the labor force.  We want them getting jobs.  So—and—and they’re going to need possibly—probably will need further support.  So I will just say this:  It’s possible that we will need to do more, and it’s possible that Congress will need to do more. In terms of the $600 unemployment insurance, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t try to give Congress advice on the specifics of that.  I—I know they’re looking at—I mean, I—I know from both talking to people and—and reading the papers that they’re looking at a whole bunch of different possible approaches going forward, and some of those seem kind of promising.  So, you know, we’re happy to give advice if people ask for it but—but probably not—not publicly. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  David Gura.  June 10, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

DAVID GURA.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  I’m going to pick up on what Scott Horsley was asking just a moment ago.  You have been studious about threading this needle in the interviews that you’ve given and speeches and the—the colloquy that’s followed, not giving advice to Congress but indicating that there’s likely to be a need for more fiscal stimulus or additional policy in the future.  So I’m going to try a hypothetical here, and you can rebuff it if—if you want. But if you were to find yourself in a—in a senator’s office suite, and he held up that May unemployment report, which you’ve described as unexpectedly positive and—and a welcome surprise, and if he or she said to you, “Look, this is an indication that we can put on the breaks,” I wonder what you would say.  Your—your message throughout this crisis has been one of how unprecedented it is, about how much urgency there is in dealing with this.  Indeed, we’ve seen that from the Federal Reserve.  I wonder if you worry that that sense of urgency isn’t being matched and—and what the consequences of that might be, if there’s a fear that the Fed could be seen as a Cassandra here as we look at that unemployment report and then through the summer, and you have more and more politicians inclined just to wait and see what happens here in—in subsequent reports. And a quick second question, if I could.  You’ve talked a lot about your fear of a second wave of this disease, and it strikes me, there’s a—a difficulty here with definition.  You’ve talked about us weathering this crisis and getting through this storm.  It seems to me, as I listen to the chatter coming from the White House and from politicians and epidemiologists, there isn’t agreement on what “getting through this” means.  And you have an Administration now inclined to, if not direct, be content with states opening up their economies perhaps too early.  How  June 10, 2020  problematic is that from a policy perspective, not having agreement on what it means to have   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL defeated this virus or gotten to a place where the economy can get through this? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I can’t offer any advice, but I will provide a little context for the—for—I want to be clear about the picture—one way to look at the picture, really, and that is this:  You can—you can get at this by looking at, you know, the—the—the widest measure of unemployment, of labor market slack, if you will, is the U-6 measure.  And the U—that’s the—the one we look—talk about all the time is called U-3, by economists.  And the—the one that has a much broader measurement of slack in the economy is U-6.  So in—in—in U-6, the U-6 level of unemployment has tripled from 7 percent to 21 percent.  That—that amounts to 22 million additional people who are—who’ve—who’ve lost work in the economy either by going to part time or something like that.  So that’s in the low 20s, and that’s post the May employment report. You can get at it a different way.  You can look at—at just the regular unemployment rate.  You can take the 21 [million]—people who have—had—are listed as unemployed right now.  You can add more on for the ones who were miscoded.  You can also take those people who are suddenly out of the labor force.  You put those together, and that has gone up by about 24 million.  So those are two different measures of what’s happened.  So the question is, 20, 22, 24 million people—got to get them back to work.  Somehow, we’ve got to all, as a country, get those people back to work.  They didn’t do anything wrong; this was a natural disaster, and I—I really—I do think the responses so far have been great.  So that’s the way I would think about it. And if—if you think we—I would just, in terms of the May employment report, it’s—it’s so nice to see.  I mean, I think what people were thinking was that you’d start to get those back-to-work kind of numbers in June and July and August.  Very few people saw them in May.  I mean, almost no one saw that happening as early as mid-May, but it did.  And so, you know, and  June 10, 2020  we—we don’t know fully what that means, whether it’s just a timing change or whether it will   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL prove to be much more than that.  We’ll—we’re going to have to wait and see.  It is a—as I mentioned earlier, it is clear evidence of just how uncertain things are, and—and how humble we have to be about our ability to—to really have confident predictions as opposed to just predictions. So, bottom line, I would just say, that—that—the key thing people need to understand is that there’s just a lot of work to do in the labor market.  We’re going to stick with this and support that until the work is done.  That you—you can—that is something we’re going to do with all of our tools, and I think it may require Congress to help as well.  It may, but that’s going to be their decision. On—you also asked about the second wave.  So we—you know, we have major responsibilities and powerful tools, but the decision about when to reopen the economy is one for elected officials at the state and local and federal level.  And, you know, if they ask, we—we don’t have any particular expertise here at the Fed in pandemics or coronaviruses or anything like that.  We talk to experts, but—you know, so we don’t have anything special to add on that.  I would just say, it’s—you know, it’s kind of self evident, I think, that if a—if it happens, you know, the—the issue would be, first of all, people’s health, but secondly, you could see a public loss of confidence in—in parts of the economy that will be already slow to recover.  So it could hurt the recovery even if you don’t have a national-level pandemic, just a—just a series of—of local ones, of local spikes could—could have the effect of undermining people’s confidence in traveling, in restaurants and entertainment, anything that involves getting people together in small groups and feeding them or flying them around—those things could be hurt.  So it would not be a positive development, and I’ll just leave it at that.  June 10, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Edward Lawrence. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Chairman Powell, for the question.  On Main Street lending facilities, you know, in May we saw 55—at least 55 companies file for bankruptcy.  Do you think that it is too late, first of all?  Second of all, the future of these facilities—is this a one-year impact to the economy through these facilities, or is this a multiple-year?  If so, how many years? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We have, you know, significant interest, we think.  And also, remember, lots and lots of companies are getting financed, too.  The—the banks are lending.  The markets are open.  You know, you have a—a—a much better lending climate than—than certainly than we had in February and March.  We don’t think it’s too late, though.  We—we—and we do expect it to be up quite soon. In terms of the timing of these things, so, you know, we’ll leave them open as—we’ll leave them open for new loans as long as they need to.  That’ll be a decision we make, of course, with our colleagues at the Treasury Department.  And, at a certain point, there won’t be a need for further loans, and—and then the assets will—will be there.  And so if that’s—I don’t know if that’s a part of your question too, but I would just say that, at that point, you know, the—the useful role of the—of the Federal Reserve is probably close to an end at that point. We don’t have any expertise in managing pools of credit assets, loans—if you will—or bonds, and we, you know, we don’t want to be made—we don’t really want to be part of the either someplace else or, you know, by—by a third party or at the Treasury Department or something.  And we’re, you know, we’re working on ideas for that.  But our real focus now is  June 10, 2020  on—is getting these facilities going and—and getting them to do the job that they—they need   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL to do. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Jonelle with Reuters. 

[SECTION]

JONELLE MARTE.  Thank you, Chair.  So I have two quick questions.  One is if we have hit bottom for the economy, and the second question is regarding the—the way that the pandemic has exacerbated racial inequality.  I wanted to ask, to what extent do you think you can factor in both disparities when you’re thinking about maximum employment? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I would say that many forecasters had been expecting a bottom for the economy in—around the middle of the year, with—with a huge range of uncertainty.  I think the labor market—the evidence of one jobs report is that the labor market may have hit bottom in a—a recovery over the second half of the year.  So it—it is possible, but the thing is, we’re not going to overreact to a single data point.  We’re going to be very careful about reaching any conclusions about—about good data or bad data.  So, I think, you know, we’re going to be here with our tools supporting this economy for as long as it’s needed.  So—but I think there’s a possibility that—that the bottom has come in the labor market, but we don’t know that yet.  We’ll—we’ll know more as we go forward. So, in terms of the—you know, the effect of the pandemic on inequality, what you see— the pandemic, of course, hits everybody, but in an economic sense, it hits those industries that are—that involve groups of people in tight groups, either in places where they’re—it’s the travel, leisure, restaurant, bars, those kinds of service-economy jobs.  And so a lot of the lost jobs were from people who work in the service economy, dealing with the public, for example, and relatively—compared to other jobs, relatively low wages.  So, and if—if you just look at what  June 10, 2020  that is, unemployment has gone up more for Hispanics, more for African Americans.  And   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL women have borne—borne an extraordinary—a notable share of the burden beyond their percentage in the workforce. So that’s really—really, really unfortunate, because if you just go back two months, where we were was, we had, effectively, the first tight labor market in a quarter-century.  And for the last couple of years before the pandemic hit, you were seeing wages go up the most for people at the lower end of the wage spectrum, and that was great.  And, you know, we were meeting with people from low- and—low- and moderate-income communities all over the country and hearing, “Don’t change this.  Do whatever you—do whatever you can.  Keep this going.  This is the best labor market we’ve seen.” And we had every expect—every expectation, every reason to expect that this would continue, and then this comes.  So it’s—it’s heartbreaking, and, you know, we want to get it back, so—we really want to get it back. And so I think we learned a number of things over the course of the last few years.  One of them is that, you know, I—you—you can have 3, 3½ percent unemployment for a couple of years, and, really, you see modest moves in wages and relatively almost invisible moves in inflation.  So that was not anybody’s understanding of the structure of the economy, I think, or most peoples’, anyway. So we can use our tools to—to support the labor market and support the economy.  We can—we can use them until we do fully recover, and that—that’s what we’re planning to do.  You know, we don’t target different groups.  What—what we are—we are cognizant of the fact, though, that late in the last cycle, late in the last expansion, the benefits really do go more to people at the lower end of the wage spectrum for—for the first time in many years when labor  June 10, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   get back to that place. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria from Politico. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, I’m Victoria Guida with Politico.  I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things that are—have already been asked.  First of all, on fiscal policy, you all obviously put out your Summary of Economic Projections today, and I’m curious to what extent future fiscal policy is factored in or not factored in to those projections, and—and how, more or less, fiscal policy might affect those projections.  And then my other question is on—on Main Street.  You’ve mentioned multiple times that, you know, the Fed and Treasury are willing to expand the program further.  So my question is, what’s the threshold for those types of changes?  Is it just making sure that borrowers that want to borrow through the program are—are—are able to do that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  In terms of the way—the way we do forecasts is, we—we don’t—the—we don’t tend to incorporate things we’re highly uncertain about.  So I think the—the forecast would not have included substantial additional—you know, big additional fiscal support for the economy.  Maybe—maybe a modest amount, something that looks like a—a low-end guess on what might come out of the current negotiations.  That’s basically what would be in the baseline.  So, of course, if there were more fiscal support, you’d see—you’d see better results sooner, but that’s a question for Congress.  You know, we’re—we’re spending a lot, and that’s really what they get to decide. In terms of Main Street and our willingness to expand it further, I think we’re—one thing we’re looking at—very strongly looking at is—is nonprofits, and is there a way to—to incorporate them into—into that facility or a similar facility.  So that’s another dimension.  I— June 10, 2020  you know, if we had a great idea for changing Main Street, we would’ve done it.  And we—and   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   we have done some things that I think are really very positive lately here.  But if we—as we learn more, it could be—it could be in terms of size, it could be in terms of lots of different things.  But I—I think we have a good product to go to market with now, and I think it’ll get—it’ll get out there soon.  And, you know, we’ll see, and—and we’ll be willing to continue to adapt. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Don Lee. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Chair Powell, as you know, the vast majority of people who have been laid off are expecting to be recalled by their employers.  At this point, what is your expectation of how much of these job losses will be permanent? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I don’t have a reliable estimate of that.  Clearly, not everyone will go back.  But—and I—I would say, many will go back, but what’s—what’s going to be the remainder when—you know, when we reach sort of what is the new normal?  It’s—it’s so uncertain, but it—it could be a good number of millions of people, I think, in many—in many estimates, but these—I’d say you’re so early in the process.  People are—for example, people are going back and looking at other significant changes in the economy, and they’ve seen how many people go back when, for example, there’s a technological change, and things like that—you going to be very hard to say. I—I, but I—my—my assumption is that there will be a significant chunk—chunk well into the millions.  I—I don’t want to give you a number, because it’s going to be a guess, but well, well into the millions of people who—who don’t get to go back to their old job.  And, in fact, there isn’t a—there may not be a job in that industry for them for some time.  There will  June 10, 2020  eventually be, but it could be some years before we get back to those people finding jobs.  I   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL mean, when—when people lose a job, if they can find a job in their own industry, that’s usually the fastest way, is—is they know other people in that industry, different kinds of jobs.  That’s usually the fastest.  If you have to go to a different industry and start over again, it’s much harder, and that’s where you start to lose people’s—who are—just fall out of the labor force.  And—and, you know, it’s very tough on their lives.  We all know people who—to whom that happened in the Global Financial Crisis, and, hence, our desire to—to do what we can to support this and—and—and support this recovery with—with the tools that we have. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer, Marketplace.  Chair Powell, I’m wondering—I want to go back to the issue of inequality, and I’m wondering, what more could the Fed do to reduce economic inequality in this country?  I mean, I know that you said you don’t target certain groups, but is there a way that you could use, for example, the black unemployment rate as—as some kind of a benchmark to something you’d want to meet or something that you’d keep track of? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We do.  We do track all unemployment by all kinds, as you know—all kinds of different demographics, including particularly the African American unemployment rate, which reached an all-time low since the data started being kept in the modern era.  Of course, it’s still close to twice the white unemployment—it is twice the unemployment rate, or it was back in the—back then.  It’s certainly much higher now. You know, the—the best thing we can do with our monetary policy tools is to—is to look at, you know, the evidence of what we saw—that we saw with our own eyes so recently, which is that the economy can have very low unemployment—very low unemployment.  It could’ve  June 10, 2020  been lower than we were.  It could be lower than 3½ percent without seeing financial   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL imbalances, without seeing inflation going—getting out of control.  We, frankly, didn’t even get inflation back up to target—without seeing wages getting out of touch with—with where they should be, so that’s the—that’s the biggest thing we can do. You know, in—in—inequality is something that’s been with us increasingly for more than four decades, and it’s—it’s not really related to monetary policy.  It’s, or—or it’s more related to—there are a lot of theories on—on what causes it, but it’s been something that’s more or less been going up consistently for more than four decades.  And there are a lot of different theories, one of which is—just is that it—globalization—globalization and technology call for rising levels of skills and aptitudes and education, and that U.S. educational attainment kind of flattened out, certainly relative to our peers—flattened out over that period. And so a lot—so that means if you’re—if you’re on the right side of those trends, then those things are good for you.  If you’re not, then your wages are going to stagnate.  And wages for the bottom, you know, 10 percent really haven’t gone up in real terms in a very long time, and—over a long period of time, whereas wages for the people at the top, compensation, any way you cut it—before taxes, after taxes, after transfers, all of those, any way you cut it—wages have—compensation has gone up a whole lot for people at the top, and it really hasn’t gone up for people at the bottom.  If you look more in the middle, then it’s—then—then it has gone up for most other groups, but at the bottom, not so much in real terms, in inflation-adjusted terms. So, you know, we—we call it out as a—as an important factor in the economy, and we will use our tools to support maximum employment and take that, you know, definition to heart.  But, obviously, that’s something that’s going to require an all-of-society, all-of-government response.     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  For the last question, we’ll go to Michael McKee with  Bloomberg TV. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee, Bloomberg Television and Radio.  I came across a statistic the other day that amazed me.  Since your March 23 emergency announcement, every single stock in the S&P 500 has delivered a positive return.  And I’m wondering, given the levels of the market right now, whether you or your colleagues feel there is a possible bubble blowing that could pop and set back the recovery significantly, or that we might see capital misallocation that will leave us worse off when this is over. Second, inequality is not just about wages, it’s also about wealth.  And a number of studies have suggested that by keeping rates low for so long and targeting the markets after the great financial crisis, that the Fed did contribute to wealth inequality in this country.  And I’m wondering if you think there is some tweak or some message you could give that would affect that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  What we’ve targeted is broader financial conditions.  If you go back to the end of February and early March, you had—basically, the world markets realized at just about the same time—I remember that Monday—that there was going to be a global pandemic, and that this possibility that it would be contained in one province in China, for all practical purposes, was not going to happen.  It all—it was—you know, it was Iran, Italy, Korea, and then it became clear in markets.  From that point forward, investors everywhere in the world, for a period of weeks, wanted to sell everything that wasn’t cash or a—a short-term Treasury instrument.  They didn’t want it to have any risk at all.  And so what happened is, markets stopped working.  They stopped working, and companies couldn’t—couldn’t borrow.  They couldn’t roll over their debt.  People couldn’t borrow.  So that’s—that’s the kind of situation that  June 10, 2020  can be very—financial turbulence and malfunction—a financial system that’s not working can   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL greatly amplify the negative effects of what was clearly going to be a major economic shock. So what our tools were—were put to work to do was to restore the markets to function.  And I think, you know, some of that has really happened, as I—as I mentioned in my opening remarks, and that’s a good thing.  So we—we’re not looking to achieve a particular level of any asset price.  What we want is investors to be pricing in risk like markets are supposed to do.  Borrowers are borrowing.  Lenders are lending.  We want the markets to be working.  And, again, we’re not looking to—to a particular level. I think our—our principal focus, though, is on—on the state of the economy and on the labor market and on inflation.  Now, inflation, of course, is—is low, and we think it’s very likely to remain low for some time, below our target.  So, really, it’s about getting the labor market back and getting it in shape.  That’s—that’s been our major focus.  And I would say, you know, we—if we were to hold back because—we would never do this, but—the idea that, just the concept that we would hold back because we think asset prices are too high—others may not think so, but we just decided that that’s the case—what would happen to those people?  You know, what would happen to the people that we’re actually legally supposed to be serving?  We’re supposed to be pursuing maximum employment and stable prices, and that’s what we’re pursuing. We’re also pursuing financial stability, but there you have a banking system that is so much better capitalized, so much stronger, better aware of its risks, better at managing its risks, more highly liquid.  You have all of those things.  And they’ve been lending.  They’ve been taking in deposits.  They’ve been a source of strength in this situation.  June 10, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL So I would say that, you know, we’re tightly focused on our real economy goals.  And—and, again, not—we’re not—we’re not focused on moving asset prices in a particular direction at all.  It’s just we want markets to be working, and I think, partly as a result of what we’ve done, they—they are working.  And, you know, we hope that continues.  Thank you very much.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
37,2020-07-29,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  The pandemic continues to cause tremendous human and economic hardship here in the United States and around the world.  The most important response to this public health crisis has come from our health-care workers, and we remain grateful to them and to the many other essential workers for putting themselves at risk day after day in service to others and to our country.  All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic.  At the Federal Reserve, we remain committed to using our tools to do what we can, and for as long as it takes, to provide some relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. In recent months, economic activity picked up as the economy began to reopen.  Many businesses opened their doors, factories restarted production, and more people left their homes to engage in various activities.  As a result, household spending looks to have recovered about half of its earlier decline, although spending for services such as air travel and hotels has shown much less of a pickup.  The recovery in household spending also likely owes to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided substantial and timely support to household incomes.  In contrast, indicators of business fixed investment have yet to show a recovery.  Even with the improved economic news in May and June, overall activity remains well below its level before the pandemic, and the contraction in real GDP in the second quarter will likely be the largest on record. The labor market has followed a similar pattern.  After precipitous drops in March and temporary layoffs.  As a result, of the roughly 22 million jobs that had been lost, about one-third had been regained as of the June payroll report.  The unemployment rate declined in May and  July 29, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL peak during the Global Financial Crisis.  In addition, the downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to bear the burden have been the most affected.  In particular, the rise in joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics.  This reversal of economic fortune has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.  For some goods, including food, supply constraints have led to notably higher prices, adding to the burden for those struggling with lost income.  More broadly, however, weaker demand, especially in sectors—such as travel and hospitality—that have been most affected by the pandemic, has held down consumer prices, and, overall, inflation is running well below our symmetric 2 percent objective. Along with the recent increases in economic activity have come new challenges.  After increased sharply in many parts of the country since mid-June.  We have thus entered a new phase in containing the virus, which is essential to protect both our health and our economy.  As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in keeping the virus in check.  Indeed, we have seen some signs in recent weeks that the increase in virus cases and the renewed measures to control it are starting to weigh on economic activity.  For example, some measures of consumer spending based on debit card and credit card use have moved down since late June, while recent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, especially among smaller businesses.  A full recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it’s safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.  July 29, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL The path forward will also depend on policy actions taken at all levels of government to provide relief and to support the recovery for as long as needed.  The Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.  We have held our policy rate near zero since mid-March and have stated that we will keep it there until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  We’ve been purchasing sizable quantities of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities in order to support orderly conditions in the markets, which are vital to the flow of credit in the economy.  To sustain smooth market functioning and foster effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace.  These purchases are also fostering more accommodative financial conditions. The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local governments.  Without access to credit, families could be forced to cut back on necessities or even lose their homes.  Businesses could be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further job losses and income losses and worsening the downturn.  Preserving the flow of credit is thus essential for mitigating the damage to the economy and promoting the recovery. Many of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today.  These programs benefit the economy by providing financing where it is not  July 29, 2020  otherwise available.  In addition, by serving as a backstop to key credit markets, the programs   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL appear to have significantly increased the extension of credit from private lenders.  We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury.  We will continue to use these powers until we are confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery.  This week we extended these programs through the end of the year.  When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox. As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers.  The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.  We can only create programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid.  Many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy.  But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer.  In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.  Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources.  The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country.  Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes.  It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of the year, and it will take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that. Before taking your questions, I’ll provide an update on our review of our monetary policy framework.  [Clears throat]  Excuse me.  As a reminder, we began this public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices—a first for the Federal Reserve—early last year.  Our purpose has been to take a comprehensive look at how we can best meet our  July 29, 2020  maximum-employment and price-stability objectives in the years ahead, particularly in light of   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL the generally lower level of interest rates around the world.  As is evident in our current situation, the lower level of interest rates has reduced the scope for the Committee to support the economy by cutting interest rates.  Our plans to conclude this review were, like so many things, delayed by the pandemic.  At this meeting, my colleagues and I resumed our discussions.  Our focus was on possible enhancements to our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.  This document states our goals, articulates our approach to monetary policy, and serves at the foundation—as the foundation for our policy actions.  While I do not have any details to share with you today, I am confident that we will continue to make progress and will wrap up our deliberations in the near future. We understand that the work of the Fed touches communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.  Thank you.  I will look forward to your questions.

MICHELLE SMITH.  James Politi. 

[SECTION]

JAMES POLITI.  Hi there.  James Politi with the Financial Times.  Chair Powell, the Fed today decided to extend dollar liquidity swap lines with a number of central banks around the world.  Why was that important for the Fed?  And how concerned are you about dollar shortages persisting over time through the pandemic? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so our—our dollar swap lines—we introduced those back at the beginning of—of this episode after the pandemic made itself present.  And dollar funding  July 29, 2020  really restored dollar funding markets around the world to fairly normal levels of activity.  And   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   so they kind of served their purpose.  But we extended them—I guess, yesterday morning—really to facilitate planning by other central banks and just so people will know that those facilities are still there. We want them to remain in place and be available as long as they are needed.  And since, you know, the crisis and the economic fallout from—from the pandemic are far from over, we’re going to leave those in place for the time being.  And we’ll leave them in place until we’re confident that they’re no longer needed.  There’s nothing that’s going on in the market right now that raises any concerns.  It’s just, we want them to be there as a backstop for markets. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Steve Liesman. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  I hope that you can hear me.  Mr. Chairman, given—you’ve said several times now that you have lending, not spending, powers.  Given that a lot of the capacity of these programs has not been used and, really, barely used, do you think that some of this money that has been dedicated by the Treasury to the Federal Reserve should be considered to be used by Congress as direct grants to businesses that are in need right now or to households, given that Congress is now saying that money is limited and they shouldn’t take—they do not want to pass a very large stimulus bill?  Is this money doing the best for the nation as a backstop for Federal Reserve programs that don’t seem to be being used all that much right now?  Thank you.  And I have a follow-up, sir. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So they—that—that’s really a question for Congress.  They—they appropriated that money, and—$454 billion for our facilities, and it’s really a question for them.  So you’re right that our facilities have not—we haven’t done as much lending as we thought.  But, in very substantial measure, that’s because markets started working again fairly soon after  July 29, 2020  we announced the facilities, particularly in the corporate credit facilities, also in the muni—in the   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   muni space, and also in the short-term funding facilities—the three of those that we set up.  So we didn’t turn out to need the kind of funding that we thought we would. On the other hand, it’s important that the facilities stay in place, and that’s why we extended them yesterday.  It’s important that they still stay in place until we’re, you know, very confident that the turmoil from the pandemic and the economic fallout are behind us.  So I—I can’t really speak to what Congress should do with it, but it’s important that the facilities be there and be fully funded in case the needs do arise down the road.  We don’t see them now, but, in case they do arise, they should be there. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Has any consideration—thank you.  Has any consideration been given to asking Congress to allow the Federal Reserve to lend to companies in bankruptcy?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Not that I’m aware of, no. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos.  [No response]  Nick, are you there?  

[SECTION]

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER.  [Aside]  I didn’t hear you say that. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  We’ll go to David Gura, NBC. 

[SECTION]

DAVID GURA.  Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.  No doubt you were paying attention when two of your predecessors were up on Capitol Hill just a few days ago answering some questions from—from lawmakers.  And a question they each answered had to do with the continuation of these pandemic unemployment benefits.  And something we’ve heard a lot is that they could be a disincentive to work.  Both of them addressed that.  I wonder if you would Thank you. [No response] as well.  July 29, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL And then, as a follow-up, I wonder what you’ve learned about the degree to which this has led to a widening of the wealth gap in this country, the degree to which maybe people are experiencing two different kinds of—of pandemics here.  Some are getting through this based on what they’ve saved and the jobs that they have.  Others are really struggling to get by.  And I wonder what role—what additional role the Fed could have in, sort of, bridging that—that yawning gap. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, on your first question, I wouldn’t want to be giving very detailed, specific advice on particular programs and the level they should be at and that kind of thing.  I just will say the following, that, you know, this—this pandemic and its fallout really represents the biggest shock to the U.S. economy in living memory.  We went from the lowest levels of unemployment we’d had in 50 years to the highest levels we’ve had in 90 years, and we did it in the space of two months.  And I would say that the response from the fiscal authorities was strong, it was fast, it was broad—and appropriately so.  And I think we are seeing the results of the earlier strong fiscal actions. When you see the spending that’s happening, when you see small businesses staying in business even though the economy hasn’t fully, successfully, sustainably reopened yet in many places, you are seeing what happens with that—that money.  And so, in—in a broad sense, it’s been well spent.  It’s kept people in their homes.  It’s kept businesses in business.  And that’s all a good thing.  I think, in the broad scheme of things, that there will be a need both for more support from us and from more fiscal policy.  Fiscal policy is up to Congress.  You see the ongoing discussions that they’re having.  And it suggests to me that there’s—you know, that both sides, they’re wrangling over—over various provisions but nonetheless believe that there is a need for some additional fiscal support.  July 29, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL And the last thing I’ll say is that if the expansion—even if—sorry.  Even if the reopening goes well and many, many people go back to work, it’s still going to take a fairly long time for the parts of the economy that are—that involve lots of people getting together in close proximity.  And that means that many of the people who were laid off from those industries—and that’s restaurants, you know, bars, hotels, public entertainment, all of those places, travel and accommodation—many of those people are going to find it hard to go back—they can’t go back to their old job.  There won’t be enough jobs for them.  So I think those people are going to need support.  I can’t say what the exact level should be.  It’s not our role.  But they’re going to need support if they’re to be able to pay their bills, to continue spending money, to remain in their current rental house or—or apartment or a house if they own it.  So I think there will be a need. In terms of inequality, really—so I think it’s fair to say that the burdens of the pandemic have fallen on, heavily—they’ve fallen on everyone, but they’ve fallen very heavily on people who work in the service industries in relatively low-paying jobs.  So there was a—a figure that came out of some of our research that was that if you make $40,000 a year or less, then 40 percent—you had a 40 percent chance of losing your job in April and May.  So it’s falling very heavily on—on people who have the least financial wherewithal to, you know, to bear that.  And that happens to be heavily skewed to minorities and to women.  So that’s just what the pandemic is doing. You know, in terms of what we’re doing, what we’re trying to do is create an environment in the financial markets and in the economy where those people have the best chance they can have to go back to work to their old job or to a new job.  That’s really what we’re doing.  Everything we do is directed at that.  July 29, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL And, you know, the—I would say—I would say one last thing on inequality.  That is, inequality is a—is an issue—has been a growing issue in our country and in our economy for four decades.  And you see it—it has many faces.  You see it in the relative flattening-out of—of incomes for people in low and—lower and middle incomes as compared to those at the top.  You see it in low mobility where people—where the chances of moving up from the bottom to the middle or the top have declined and are lower than they are in other comparable wealthy countries.  So it’s a serious economic problem for the United States, but it’s—it’s got underlying causes that are not related to monetary policy or to our response to the pandemic. Again, four decades of evidence suggests it’s about globalization.  It’s about the flattening-out of educational attainment in the United States compared to our other competitor countries.  It’s about technology advancing, too.  If you’re on the wrong side of those forces, it’s been—your income has stagnated.  So it’s—it’s a critical, critical problem for our society, but one that really falls mainly to fiscal policy and other policies.  Our part of it is to—is to push as hard as we can on our employment mandate while keeping price stability.  We saw what happened to people at—at the lower end of the income spectrum late in the last expansion.  It was the best labor market in 50 years, they told us.  We saw that the biggest wage increases were going to people at the bottom end of the—of the wage spectrum for the last couple of years of that 10-year, 8-month expansion.  So a tight labor market is probably the best thing that the Fed can foster to—to go after that—that problem, which is a—a serious one. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  And now, Nick Timiraos. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Yeah.  [Inaudible] Journal.  Chair Powell, you have described your asset purchase objective as stabilizing markets.  And with markets having stabilized, aren’t the asset purchases now doing more than address market function by supporting your  July 29, 2020  macroeconomic objectives?  The other question I have is, what is your strategy going to be with   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   respect to using asset purchases to support your macroeconomic objectives going forward?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So you’re right, the asset purchases in—in their current size really sprang from severe dysfunction in the Treasury and MBS markets at the beginning of the market reaction to the pandemic.  And thanks to those purchases, we have substantially restored—not fully, but substantially restored functioning markets.  This is absolutely critical.  That market is really one of the—it’s part of the absolute bedrock of the global financial markets, and it’s—it’s essential that it—that it work well, and it is doing so now. And we’ve always said, though, that we understand, accept, and are fine with the fact that—that those purchases are also fostering a more accommodative stance of monetary policy, which would tend to support macroeconomic outcomes.  So it’s doing both, and—and, you know, we’ve understood that for some time.  It’s not—the programs are not structured exactly like the—the QE programs were in the last—in the last financial—in the aftermath of the last financial crisis.  Those were more focused on buying longer-run securities.  The current purchases are all across the—the maturity spectrum.  Nonetheless, they are supporting accommodative financial conditions.  I think it’s—it’s clear that that’s the case. In terms of our strategy, you know, that just remains to be seen.  We—as you know, we’ve spent a lot of time in meetings this year looking at the tools that we have to adjust our current stance of policy.  We do feel that our current monetary policy stance is the appropriate one.  You know, we cut rates close to zero right at the beginning.  We—we ramped up asset purchases, and those—those have really helped.  And we gave forward guidance on—on both of those things, which the markets appear to understand, and market pricing is consistent with  July 29, 2020  those.  So we think we’re—we think that our—our policy stance is a good one.  We’re, of   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL course, prepared to adjust that stance as appropriate and when we deem it as appropriate to—to better foster achievement of our goals, of course. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Jeanna. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you for taking my question.  You talked to Larry Fink at BlackRock in March, April, and May, according to your public calendars.  I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what you talked about, and, if the topic of those conversations was the corporate credit facilities, how did you handle potential conflicts of interest during those conversations? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so—so BlackRock is just our agent.  You know, we make the policy decisions in conjunction with our colleagues, and they just execute our—our plans.  I actually don’t remember exactly what I would have been talking with him about, but he’s a—you know, he’s the head of a major service provider.  He generally checks in to find out whether we’re okay with the quality of the service that—that BlackRock is providing.  I don’t have the daily face-to-face interaction with anybody else at BlackRock or—or, as you can see, three phone calls in the course of a few months.  It wasn’t very many. So I think, you know, their conflicts are managed extremely carefully in the contractual arrangements we have with them.  And, again, I would have—I—I can’t recall exactly what those conversations were, but they were—they would have been about what are you seeing in the typically trying to make sure that—that we are getting good service from the company that he founded and leads.  That’s—I’d say that’s his main objective when we talk. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, thank you.  We’ll go to Scott Horsley.  July 29, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Scott Horsley from NPR.  I wonder if you can give us an update on the coin shortage that you talked to lawmakers about last month and what, if anything, that tells us about the, sort of, economic circulatory system. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So—the situation with coins is that the—the quantity of coins is going up but was adequate before the pandemic.  The problem is, the circulation kind of stopped because stores were closed, banks were closed.  It just—customers weren’t spending, they were—so the coins stopped moving in the system.  So we’ve been working for—ever since that began to happen, we saw it happening right away.  We’ve been working to try to—try to reverse that disruption of the supply chain and restore normal circulation for our coins.  So we’re working with the U.S. Mint, which is the issuing authority, to address the issue.  Just last week, the Mint—you may have seen—issued a statement asking for the public’s help in keeping coins circulating, and various people, you know, went and put their coins back into circulation. We also created a coin task force with all of the stakeholders—you know, banks and, you know, the armored carriers, the banking community, credit unions, everybody in the—in the coin supply chain.  We’re in frequent communication with the banks and with the—with the armored carriers trying to get back to where we need to be.  So we do think the inventories are building up.  You know, the Mint—the Mint is making coins as fast as they can, but—but, you know, things happen with—in the factory environment:  Someone will come to work with COVID—I think this has happened in—in almost every factory environment around the country—and then they’ll shut down for a day, and then they come back, and that kind of thing.  So—so we’re closely monitoring it.  It’s—you know, it’s a significant issue.  We’ve—we’ve got a lot of resources on it, and we do feel like we’re—we’re making progress. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, thank you.  Rachel Siegel.  July 29, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hey, Chair Powell.  Thank you for taking my question.  I’m wondering if you can be a bit more specific about any risks that you see related to a double-dip recession or signs that the recovery was stalling, or maybe begin to stalling, compared to some of the signs that we were seeing earlier in the summer.  Thanks very much. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  So maybe I’ll talk more broadly about the—the outlook and include your—include your question in it.  So, as I mentioned, economic activity and employment picked up beginning in May and right through June and remained well below their levels because, I’d say, job gains have reversed about a third of the job losses from March and were—those were sooner and stronger than we expected.  So—but what happened then was, along with that positive data, we got—we got the virus increases starting in the middle of June in lots and lots of states around the country.  And that brings us to a new—a new point here, which is, we need to—in addition to dealing with the health crisis—we have to remember, this is really a health crisis, and these are people who are having the coronavirus, and it’s taking a terrible toll, so we’ve got to deal with the economic ramifications of that. So what we’re seeing is that we monitor quite a lot of what we—what we think of as sort of nonstandard, high-frequency data.  That’s become a very important thing, even more important than usual in the work that we do.  And what that data show, on balance, is that the pace of the recovery looks like it has slowed since the cases began that spike in June.  So some measures of consumer spending based on credit card and debit card data have moved down.  Recent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, particularly among smaller businesses.  Hotel occupancy rates have flattened out.  People aren’t going out to restaurants, bars, gas stations, pharmacies, and beauty salons as much.  Consumer surveys, by the way,  July 29, 2020  which had dropped very sharply when the pandemic arrived and then moved back up sharply—  Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL they look like they may be softening again now. There are still some areas of strength.  Housing and motor vehicle sales have still been strong.  Nonetheless, on balance, it looks like the data are pointing to a slowing in the pace of the recovery.  But I want to stress, it’s—it’s too early to say both how large that is and how sustained it will be.  We just don’t know yet, because we have to wait for—to see the, you know, the actual data on spending and employment come in, and—but this—this is what we’re seeing, and, of course, we’re monitoring it very carefully. And I’d be remiss in not stressing this enough.  The path of the economy is going to depend to a very high extent on the course of the virus and on the measures that we take to keep it in check.  That is just a very fundamental fact about our economy right now.  The two things are not in conflict.  You know, social-distancing measures and fast reopening of the economy, they actually go together.  They’re not in competition with each other.  So—

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi.  Well, just to follow up on that a bit—and thanks for taking my question—you added the sentence into the statement about the course of the economy depends on the path of the virus.  Is this—do you feel this idea, or this view, is not widely enough understood?  Do you feel—you had warned back in May that too early reopening or an incautious reopening might harm the economy.  Do you feel that message was not heard, and that some of these reopenings took place perhaps sooner than they should have? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I think we feel that it—it might be, the most central fact or the most central driver of the path of the economy right now is the virus.  And you’re seeing that again now.  You saw that in the—during the lockdown when we got cases way down, and  July 29, 2020  you saw the economy reopening, and you saw spending go up and hiring go up.  And now that   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL the—that the cases have spiked again—again, the early data, the high-frequency data suggest that there is a slower pace of growth, at least for now.  We don’t know how deep or how long that will be.  So it’s such an important sentence.  We just decided that it needed to be in our—in our postmeeting statement.  It’s so fundamental.  And, you know, I think we can’t say it enough.  It’s—it’s really important. We’re—you know, you can think of it as three stages.  There’s the lockdown, and we know what that looks like, and we’ll get the data, I guess, later this week on GDP being down very historically large amounts.  Then there was the reopening, and we would expect that many, many people would go back to work.  Those whose jobs could be done without—you know, without exposure to lots of people in tight groups, they should have been—they should be able to go back to work during that phase fairly quickly.  But that would depend on being able to keep the virus under control, which will depend on wearing masks and other social-distancing measures.  So that’s where we are.  It’s such an important factor.  It’s—it’s in—we’re all talking about it, so we thought it really had to be in the statement. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Mike McKee. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, I’m wondering what it is—you’ve talked a lot about using all of your tools, and Governor Brainard talked about moving from support to accommodation—what it is you can actually do.  You’ve lowered rates to zero.  You’ve set up the lending programs.  There hasn’t been much take-up.  And the tools you talk about are generally in service of keeping interest rates low, where they already are.  So unless you were to go to negative interest rates, I’m wondering what additional accommodation the Fed can bring.   July 29, 2020  Or is it really up to the fiscal authorities at this point to rescue the economy, to—to add   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL additional help for it? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So you’re right.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the U.S. economy at this difficult time, and we will always remain committed in that sense.  We feel like we have ways to further support the economy certainly through our credit and liquidity facilities, which are effectively unlimited.  We can adjust those programs.  We also can adjust our forward guidance.  We can adjust our asset purchases.  So there are things that we can do.  We—we feel like we have the ability to do more. But I would not disagree with the—with the importance of fiscal policy—with your statement about the importance of fiscal policy.  Fiscal policy can do—can address things that we can’t address.  If there are particular groups that need help, that need direct monetary help—not a loan, but an actual grant as the PPP program showed—you can save a lot of businesses and a lot of jobs with those in a case where lending a company money might not be the right answer.  The company might not want to take a loan out in order to pay workers who can’t work because there’s no business.  So lending is a particular tool, and we’re using it very aggressively. But fiscal policy is essential here, and I would say, again, Congress’s action early in the pandemic—historically large by any standard around the world, and certainly by U.S. standards—it’s really helping now.  It’s really helping.  It’s going to stand up very well to—to scrutiny down the years.  This Congress’s very fast and very open-handed response, I think, has really helped.  And I think—I know that, as I’ve said, very likely more will be needed from—from all of us, and I see Congress negotiating now over—over a new package, and I think that’s a good thing.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Edward Lawrence. July 29, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question.  So you talked about it several times today:  The FOMC statement directly says the path of the economy is linked to the path of the virus.  It looks like a vaccine might come this year, either in October or towards the end of the year.  Has the Committee talked about how that might change Fed policies?  And, as a follow, do you see a vaccine helping inflation get back to where you want it to be?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we—of course, the concept of vaccines comes up in our discussions.  Of course it does.  But I have to say, you know, we’re—our job is not to plan for the upside case, right?  The upside case—we’ve got that covered.  Our job is to plan for all—the full range of things that could happen.  And so we’re assuming—we’re going to continue to assume that our facilities are needed, that our policies are needed, and that the public needs—you know, needs the support that we’re giving the public until—until shown otherwise.  There’s great uncertainty around the development of therapeutics and vaccines.  All of us want them to happen as soon as possible, but we can’t plan on that.  We’ve got to hope for the worst—hope for the [laughs]—hope for the best and plan for the worst, I guess it goes. In terms of inflation, I don’t know.  I mean, I—you know, I think, fundamentally, this is a disinflationary shock.  I know there—there is a lot of discussion about how this might lead to inflation over time, but, you know, we’re—we’re seeing disinflationary pressures around the world going into this.  Now we see a big shock to demand, and we see core inflation dropping to 1 percent.  And I do think for quite some time we’re going to be struggling against disinflationary pressures rather than against inflationary pressures. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Ann Saphir.  July 29, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

ANN SAPHIR.  Hi.  Yes, thanks for taking my question.  So, I mean, as you monitor the rising infections and the slowing pace of the recovery, could you speak to, what would the trigger be for doing further easing?  And on the flip side of that, when would it be reasonable to expect the Fed to consider raising rates again?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, as we’ve said, we’re carefully monitoring the situation.  We moved very quickly and very aggressively early, and we’ve been monitoring the situation.  And I think the markets and—and the economy—you know, I think our policy is in a good place.  But we’ve looked at—at ways of adapting our policy as time goes by, and we’re ready to do that when we think it’s appropriate.  I can’t give you a specific trigger.  It really just is when we think it would help:  Would it help more than what we’re doing now to foster maximum employment and stable prices? Sorry, your second question was?  [Inaudible]  I can’t hear you.  Say it again? 

[SECTION]

ANN SAPHIR.  Sorry—for when it would be reasonable for the Fed to consider raising— 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Oh. 

[SECTION]

 ANN SAPHIR.  —rates again. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So as I—as I said earlier, or a while back, we’re not even thinking about—thinking about raising rates.  We’re—we’re totally focused on providing the economy the support that it will need.  We think that the economy will need highly accommodative monetary policy and the use of our tools for an extended period.  And we’re absolutely committed to staying in this until—until we’re very confident that that is no longer needed.  So I wouldn’t look for us to be sending signals about cutting back on facilities or anything like that for a very long time.  We’re—we’re in this until—until we’re well through it.  July 29, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL And I think this—you know, I think the picture is, you have the—you have the lockdown, then you have the reopening.  But there’s probably going to be a long tail where a large number of people are struggling to get back to work because those—those heavily affected areas of the economy are going to be challenged, really, to employ the millions of people who are now out of work.  I think 14 million people are now out of work who were working in February, something like that.  So that’s going to take a while, I think, in everyone’s reckoning.  And I just—everyone should know that we’re going to be there for all of that. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Catarina with Bloomberg. 

[SECTION]

CATARINA SARAIVA.  Hi, Chair.  Thanks for taking our questions.  You mentioned earlier that the labor market we had in February was the best we’ve had in 50 years, yet at that point the Black unemployment rate was still double that of whites.  So I wanted to ask you, you know, we’ve seen some economists and even the Biden campaign call for the Fed to more specifically target the gap between minority unemployment rates.  Even if you don’t get a mandate on this from Congress, is it something you would consider more explicitly going forward?  And how would you do that? And then I also wanted to ask you about former economist Claudia Sahm’s writings from last night.  She gave a pretty harrowing account of her time at the Fed—described harassment and professional gaslighting that others have also spoken to.  Is this your Federal Reserve? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  So, first, on the unemployment, you’re right.  And we always point this out in our—in our remarks.  While the aggregate unemployment rate was 3½ percent, every—every economy—every market in every economy has longer-run issues.  And one of ours is just the disparate level of unemployment between—between Blacks and whites.  And it’s generally sort of twice as much—twice as high for Blacks.  So even—but this was the lowest,  July 29, 2020  you know, Black unemployment rate in 50 years—or, actually, since we started keeping records,   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   which was less than 50 years ago.  So that’s just a fact, and it’s—it’s not a good fact, you know. So we have started, though, in recent years to focus considerable time and attention on disparate levels of unemployment—for example, among—among different racial groups and demographic groups.  We regularly discuss those differences in our FOMC discussions.  We call them out in testimony and in speeches and in our Monetary Policy Report to Congress.  You’ll see it everywhere, in all the things that we do. So what does that mean?  I think—you know, I think what we learned is that a tight labor spectrum generally.  But it—you know, tight labor markets, it took 8 years—it took sort of the 8th and 9th and 10th years of that expansion to get to those benefits.  So we need more than that.  That’s not a good strategy, waiting 8, 9, 10 years to get there.  So we’re—we’re going to get back there as fast as we can, because that’s what we can do, but society more broadly can affect these things.  You know, we don’t really have tools that can address distributional, disparate outcomes as well as fiscal policy.  And just policy generally—education, health care, all those things are much better at doing that. In terms of—so we do—you will see that—you will see that discussed—the Black unemployment rate discussed all the time in what we do.  And I think we clearly understand now that it’s something to weigh when you get a tight labor market.  It’s something that you want to be focused on and weigh.  So it is very much in our thinking—again, in a world where we don’t really have the best tools to address that.  So, something that we’re doing. So I have not seen that—I did not see that blog post yet, although someone did mention it to me.  We, of course, have been in meetings until just before this.  So, but—and I will take a  July 29, 2020  look at it.  I will do that.  And, you know, I—without having had a chance to think about it, read   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   it, understand it, I’ll just say a couple things.  First, I think it’s fair to acknowledge that there’s been a lot of pain and injustice and unfair treatment that women have experienced in the workplace—not just among economists, but among economists and at the Fed.  That’s been going on for far too long.  And, you know, like every other organization, the Fed could have done more and—and should have done more. I would say, though, that we—you know, we have made it a very high priority to have as diverse and inclusive an organization as we can.  And I think we’ve made a lot of progress on that.  I think we want a place where it’s free to speak, where views are welcome, where people can disagree but must do so respectfully.  I think a lot of organizations are coming around to understanding the importance of that.  And I—my experience has been, you know, from my career in business too, is that organizations—the really successful organizations in our society get this.  They do.  They—mostly, they get it that if you want to attract the best people, this is what you—you’re going to attract the best people by having a diverse and inclusive workforce, so—and workplace.  So we’ve made diversity a priority. We actually—you know, this has been a big issue for the economics profession.  We had the—the two heads of the AEA task force on this—who happen to be named Ben Bernanke and before, which had several hundred—500 people or something like that listening in about—about these issues.  So we’re doing a lot.  I’m sure we can do more.  We’re doing a lot to—you know, to foster a respectful climate—particularly for women, but for—for all people.  So it’s—it’s a very high priority for us as an organization.  I will look into—into that and—when I—you know, when this is over.  July 29, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, thank you.  Don Lee. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Chair Powell, on the labor market, jobless claims rose again recently, and new hiring activity has weakened.  I wonder, how big are the risks of the unemployment rate rising and job growth turning negative this summer? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So as I mentioned earlier, you know, we’re watching this high-frequency data.  And, of course, the official labor market reports come out once a month, and no one has had a very good record lately of predicting what they’re going to say.  They’ve been, in humility is appropriate here in terms of thinking we understand exactly where this is going.  I think all we can say today is that there’s—there’s evidence in the high-frequency data, the surveys, and, you know, you’re tracking—you get pictures of spending.  You get pictures of people’s movements.  And what we—it looks like we’re seeing a slowdown in the rate of growth.  That’s—and that might be—it might be short lived, it might not be, you know.  And it seems to be related to—and the timing of it seems to be related to the spike in cases that began in the middle of June. Now, I really don’t want to get ahead of where the data are on this.  So we’re just going to have to see.  We’re going to have to—the data over the next couple of months will answer that question.  And recent experience suggests we—we need to wait and see.  In any case, there’s clearly a risk that we’re going to see a slowdown in the rate of growth in economic activity and in hiring.  It might still be at a robust level.  Honestly, we—we will not know until we start to see more data come in.

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  Thanks for taking my question.  I wanted to ask about the 13(3) facilities.  You all have used your emergency authority to buy assets that you can’t directly buy, like corporate bonds, ETFs.  So I was just wondering, what is the scope of your authority under 13(3)?  What type of assets are you allowed to buy?  Could you buy equities through an SPV, for example? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we haven’t—we haven’t looked at that, and we have no—no intention.  We haven’t done any work or thought about buying equities.  But, you know, we—we’re bound by the—by the provisions of 13(3), which requires that we make, you know, facilities—programs or facilities of broad applicability, meaning we have to have—it can’t just be focused on one entity.  You know, it has to be a broad group of entities. There’s a lot in 13(3) about—about the solvency of the borrowers.  You know, remember, it was rewritten or amended after the financial crisis, and it was written in a way that was—that was to—meant to make it challenging to bail out large financial institutions.  That’s—there was a lot in there to make sure that, you know, that they were going to be solvent and things like that.  So, you know, we have to meet those requirements.  You know, we haven’t looked and said—tried to say, “What can we buy?” and, you know, “Let’s make a complete list.”  You know, we felt that, using these facilities, that we could buy corporate bonds and—and municipal bonds, too.  So— 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  So I just—sorry, just to follow up really quickly.  So is it—is it generally supposed to be primarily directed at debt instruments, since you talked about 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  The statute doesn’t say that, but, yeah, you could read the statute that way if you want.  Honestly, we haven’t tried to push it to, you know, what’s the theoretical limit borrowers?  July 29, 2020  of it.  I mean, I think, clearly, it’s—it’s supposed to—it’s supposed to replace lending, you know.    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   That’s—that’s really what you’re doing.  You’re stepping in to provide credit at times when the so I think you’ve got to—you’ve got to sort of work within that framework. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Greg Robb. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Can you hear me?  Okay.  One of the things in this crisis that’s unusual is that companies are cutting wages and salaries, and that’s something, you know, we haven’t seen much.  And I was wondering what the Fed is thinking about this.  It—it seems to indicate that inflation could be more volatile in coming—coming months and coming years. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I—I think that the main thing that tells you is that the—the labor market has a long way to go to recover.  You know, we had a good labor market.  It wasn’t perfect.  There were always issues.  There are always going to be issues within an economy.  But the labor market really has a long way to go now.  Even with two very strong months of job creation—7½ million jobs between the two months—we still have 14 million people unemployed.  So it’s just—it’s a long way to go.  And as—and that leads to a situation where there are so many people looking for jobs, and we have the economy only partially reopened.  So there aren’t, you know—until the economy—or as the economy fully reopens, people can go back to work, but—so it’s a tough situation. And I’ve read reports of that.  You know, of course, the reported wages went up because of the composition effect—you know, it’s low-paid workers didn’t go back to work, so—they were the ones that got laid off—so average hourly earnings went up.  But clearly, clearly the pressure—there will not be much upward pressure on wages and compensation at the aggregate  July 29, 2020  level here in a world where there are just an awful lot of people looking for work.  And the   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL main—so it just underscores again the—the urgency of doing everything we can to restore the labor force and—and to support those who are—who want to be in the labor force but whose jobs have gone away for some period of time as they find other work due to this natural disaster. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Jean Yung. 

[SECTION]

JEAN YUNG.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you very much.  I wanted to ask about forward guidance.  Do you see merits to tying your asset purchases to economic outcomes?  And would you consider both inflation and labor market conditions as part of those outcomes?  And specifically, for the labor market, what conditions would you want to see before you think about pulling back stimulus?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So that’s a great discussion that we—we’ve talked about that at past meetings, and I imagine we will at future meetings and haven’t made any decisions yet on that.  But, you know, you’ve got a couple ways to go.  You can tie—you can tie them to dates.  You can say we will—for a specific period of time, we will keep rates at X level.  Or you can say we’ll keep them there until you achieve a certain macroeconomic goal.  And it can either be inflation or it could be an employment goal, as you pointed out. And I think that, you know, there’s attraction in all of those depending on the situation, I think, for obvious reasons.  You can imagine situations where, you know, where you’d really want to be targeting macroeconomic outcomes.  It’s also the case, though, that sometimes—sometimes date-based guidance works too.  I think it really is very fact specific, and it’s not something we’ve—you know, we haven’t made any decisions on that, so I wouldn’t be standing here telling you we’re going to go this way or that way, you know, should the time come for us to—to change our forward guidance.  July 29, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Hannah. 

[SECTION]

HANNAH LANG.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for doing this today.  I wanted to ask, on the stimulus bill that Senate Republicans are considering, they’ve said that they’re weighing whether to revise the Collins Amendment in order to ease the tier 1 leverage ratio for banks.  Are you concerned that doing so will deplete bank capital, given that the Fed’s stress tests showed that, under the most severe scenarios for economic recovery, that several banks would approach the regulatory minimum capital requirements? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So—okay.  So I think what the stress tests showed is that, under the “regular way” stress test, the banks passed.  But right in the middle of the—of the stress test came the pandemic.  And so we quickly dropped in three other scenarios, which were, you know, really bad scenarios.  And many of the banks passed, but some didn’t.  So we—and that was done very quickly.  So we pivoted, and we used the provision that says we can—that says there’s been a material change, and we’re going to ask them to resubmit their capital plans.  We also stopped buybacks—share buybacks and limited dividends.  So we’re working through the details of how all of that will work.  I think we’re going to—I think we’re going to send out the—the stress scenarios on September 30th.  So, I would say, that’s—you know, that—that process is working that way. And—but you’re making a connection to it, to the Collins Amendment fix.  So what’s going on there is that, like many other supervisors and regulators around the world, what we found is that our—we have found our banks are strong.  They’re strongly capitalized, with lots of liquidity.  And they’ve really been a source of strength in this—in this crisis so far.  And they’ve written off bad loans and things like that.  They’re still well capitalized and strong and will be, I think, a source of strength in this situation.  July 29, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL So—but what—what we did earlier was, we—what happens is, the banks run up against their leverage ratio, which is a non-risk-sensitive measure just of the amount of assets on the balance sheet.  So people put cash in—on deposit at the banks, and they reached the limit of how—how much they could grow or made loans—you know, they—companies drew down loans and deposited cash.  So we gave some leverage ratio relief earlier by temporarily—it’s temporary relief—by eliminating, temporarily, Treasuries from the calculation of the—of the leverage ratio.  This is a—this is another additional thing to do.  If Congress chooses to do this, we would want it to be explicitly temporary.  We—in other words, this will not be a permanent change in capital standards. We haven’t decided to do it, but it would give us the ability to allow banks to grow their balance sheet and, in doing so, to serve their customers better.  And, you know, I have to tell you, if you look around the world, bank regulators—many, many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief.  You know, Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Japan, the European Commission did, the Bank of Canada did, we did.  It’s—it’s not, it’s not—what it’s doing is, it’s allowing them to grow their balance sheet in a way that serves their customers.  That—that’s really what it’s doing.  And, again, I would want it to be explicitly temporary if—if we do do it. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, thank you.  We’ll go to Brian Cheung for the last question. 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Thanks so much.  Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  I wanted to ask just how the framework review is working in tandem with your discussion on explicit forward guidance.  So is the idea that you’re trying to have some order to that, that you would announce the findings of the Fed review before then committing to some sort of explicit forward guidance or even yield curve control policy?  Thanks.  July 29, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so I do think that completion of the review would—first of all, it’s something that was a very high priority for—we were really looking forward to completing it, probably, at the June meeting, but it might have been the meeting before that.  We were right on track, and then we got distracted.  I—and we weren’t expecting the pandemic, of course.  Nobody was.  So the pandemic came in.  I think it is important to go back and finish that, and I do think that will inform, you know, everything we do going forward. I would also tell you, though, that, to—to a very large extent, the—the changes we’ll make to the Statement of [on] Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy are really codifying the way we’re already acting with our policies.  To a large extent, we’re already doing the things that are—that are in there.  This is just a way of—of acknowledging that and putting them in the document.  I can’t tell you what the exact timing of that will be, but I do think that’s a—that’s a sensible way to think about it.  Thanks very much. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you very much.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
38,2020-09-16,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us—maximum employment and price stability.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide some relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.  Today my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I made some important changes to our policy statement, including an update to our guidance for the likely path of our policy interest rate.  Guided by our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that we announced a few weeks ago, these changes clarify our strong commitment over a longer time horizon.  Before describing today’s policy actions, let me briefly review recent economic developments. Economic activity has picked up from its depressed second-quarter level, when much of the economy was shut down to stem the spread of the virus.  With the reopening of many businesses and factories and fewer people withdrawing from social interactions, household spending looks to have recovered about three-quarters of its earlier decline.  Nonetheless, spending on services that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality, is still quite weak.  The recovery in household spending also likely owes to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided substantial and timely support to household incomes.  Activity in the housing sector has returned to its level at the beginning of the year, and we are starting to see signs of an improvement in business investment.  The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our June Summary of  September 16, 2020  Economic Projections.  Even so, overall activity remains well below its level before the   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL pandemic and the path ahead remains highly uncertain. In the labor market, roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April have been regained as many people returned to work.  The unemployment rate declined over the past four months but remains elevated at 8.4 percent as of August.  Although we welcome this progress, we will not lose sight of the millions of Americans who remain out of work.  Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 7.6 percent at the end of this year, 5.5 percent next year, and 4 percent by 2023. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit.  In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the services sector, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics.  The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.  For some goods, including food, supply constraints have led to notably higher prices, adding to the burden for those struggling with lost income.  More broadly, however, weaker demand, especially in sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, has held down consumer prices, and overall, inflation is running well below our 2 percent longer-run objective.  The median inflation projection from FOMC participants rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.7 percent next year and reaches 2 percent As the economy began its recovery, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths also rose.  The reimposition of some social-distancing restrictions as well as more cautious behavior by many individuals have succeeded in slowing the spread of the virus.  As we have emphasized in 2023.  September 16, 2020  throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL depend in large part on our success in keeping the virus in check.  All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic.  Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength.  A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities. The path forward will also depend on the policy actions taken across all parts of the government to provide relief and to support the recovery for as long as needed.  The Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  We remain committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time. The changes we made in today’s policy statement reflect our strategy to achieve our dual-mandate goals by seeking to eliminate shortfalls from maximum employment and achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, as we articulated in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.  We view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal and do not see a high level of employment as posing a policy concern unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals.  And we believe that achieving inflation that averages 2 percent over time helps ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at our longer-run 2 percent objective.  In turn, well-anchored inflation expectations enhance our ability to meet both our employment and inflation objectives, particularly in the new normal in which interest rates are closer to their effective lower bound even in good times.  September 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL Hence, as we say in our statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we “will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.”  We expect “to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes”—including maximum employment—“are achieved.”  With regard to interest rates, we now indicate that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate “until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.” In addition, over coming months we will continue to increase our “holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace.”  These asset purchases are intended “to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.” We believe the strong policy guidance we are providing today will serve the economy well by promoting our goals through the many possible paths the recovery may take.  Of course, as we note in our policy statement, we “would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of our [the Committee’s] goals.” The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local governments.  Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating the damage to the economy and promoting a robust recovery.  Many of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in  September 16, 2020  very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today.  These programs serve as a   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   backstop to key credit markets and appear to have restored the flow of credit from private lenders through normal channels.  We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled, in large part, by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury.  When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox. As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers.  The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.  We can only create programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid.  Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy.  But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer.  In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.  Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources.  The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country.  Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes.  It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.  September 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL Finally, I would like to take a moment to recognize the passing of our friend and colleague, Thomas Laubach.  His outstanding analysis and advice have been indispensable to the FOMC and have played a key role in the policy decisions that will define this era of the Federal Reserve.  He will be remembered for his intellect, but also his kindness, his equanimity, and his dedication to achieving our mission on behalf of the American people.  We will miss him.  Thank you.  I’ll now be glad to take your questions.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos.

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Good afternoon, Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos from the Wall Street Journal.  You’ve been very clear about the Committee’s intention on rates, not even thinking about thinking about raising rates, and today showing low rates even as unemployment falls to 4 percent and inflation rises to 2 percent.  My question is about asset purchases.  Does the guidance today apply to the current asset purchase pace?  Are there any macroeconomic conditions under which you would favor increasing the monthly pace of Treasury and MBS purchases?  And under what conditions would a decrease in the monthly pace of purchases be appropriate?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  So we say in our postmeeting statement that we’ll continue to increase our securities holdings “at least at the current pace” over coming months “to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions.”  That latter part is an updating of our guidance to reflect what I’ve been saying in these press conferences for some time and what other central banks have acknowledged, which is that the purchases are fostering accommodative financial conditions as well.  That amounts to roughly $80 billion a month of Treasuries and $40 billion net per month for MBS.  September 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL So we do—we do think that these purchases have been effective in, in restoring orderly by fostering more accommodative financial conditions, which, of course, we think is a good thing.  So, in terms of going forward, I would just say this:  There are various ways and margins that we can adjust our tools going forward, and we’ll continue to monitor developments.  And we’re prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  If I could—if I could follow up, I suppose the question I have is, why give guidance on one policy tool but not give guidance on the other policy tool when the Fed has talked about those two policy tools working together? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we, we think our—we think our policy stance is appropriate today, and we’re prepared to adjust it going forward as we, as we see appropriate.  And today we believe that particularly this very strong forward guidance—very powerful forward guidance that we’ve announced today will provide strong support for the economy.  Effectively, we’re saying that rates will remain highly accommodative until the economy is far along in its recovery, and that, that should be a very powerful statement in supporting economic activity. Now we’re buying $120 billion in securities per month across the—across the Treasury curve.  That’s also adding to accommodation.  We do have the flexibility to adjust that tool and, and the rate tool and, and other tools as well.  But as for right now, we think—we think that our policy setting is appropriate to support the expansion.  We did—we said from the beginning that we would first try to provide some support and stability and relief in the first phase of the crisis, the acute phase, and then we would support the expansion when it came.  Well, it’s here.  And it’s well along.  And so that’s why we changed our guidance today, and we do have the flexibility to do more when we think it’s appropriate.  September 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking my question.  Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.  I was wondering, you beefed up your language on financial stability in the long-run statement that you unveiled with your Jackson Hole speech last month.  I’m wondering if you could kind of walk us through how you think about financial stability concerns as a factor in guiding and interpreting increases.  You know, would financial stability concerns on their own be enough to merit changes in the fed funds rate?  Or would they have to come in conjunction with an overheating on inflation or some sort of dramatic drop in the unemployment rate?  If you could, sort of, give us an outline of your thinking there, please. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So what we said in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy was that the Committee’s policy decisions reflect “its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessment[s] of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.”  So that’s what we said about financial stability.  And today we said that we’d “be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of our [the Committee’s] goals.” But you asked specifically about, about financial stability.  One thing I would say is that financial—that monetary policy should not be the first line of defense—is not the first line of defense on financial stability.  We look to more appropriate tools in the first instance as a first line of defense, and those would be regulation, supervision, high capital, high liquidity, stress testing—all of those things, macroprudential tools.  All of those things are, are really the first line of defense on financial stability.  But we always leave open the idea that we will not ignore  September 16, 2020  those kinds of risks and other kinds of risks, more broadly, that could impede the attainment of   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL our goals in, in setting monetary policy.  So that’s, that’s really how we think about it, but principally that, you know, other tools are the—are the frontline, as I mentioned. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Just to follow up quickly, if, if other tools aren’t forthcoming, would financial stability concerns in and of themselves be enough to warrant a rate hike? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, what we said again in the [Statement on] Longer-Run [Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy]—you know, in our consensus statement is that we, you know—“policy decisions reflect … the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.”  So the test would be, you know, does a majority of the Committee feel that, that monetary policy is, is triggering that?  And that, that would be—that would be the test.  And, you know, it’s not something that we’ve done.  We do monitor financial stability concerns, of course, intensely and regularly.  We try to use our other tools on them, but we, we do keep them in mind as we think about monetary policy. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Steve Liesman. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you could help me understand how the projections of the Committee line up with the goals of the Committee.  You’ve now altered the projections to—the statement to aim for inflation above 2 percent.  But when I look at the SEP, I don’t see the Committee believing a single year in the next four years that you are ever above 2 percent.  In fact, for each year, you are below it until 2023, which is the first time that you actually hit 2 percent.  So do you think—are, are you confident—is this just the Committee is not confident that not only can it not hit its 2 percent goal, but that now it can’t hit its goal of being above 2 percent?  September 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Not at all.  And, you know, you don’t—you also don’t see people, by and large, lifting off or raising interest rates above zero.  I guess there are 4 exceptions out of a Committee of 17 during that—during the forecast period.  So we don’t reach 2 percent, but we get very close to it in the forecast.  We reach 2 percent—I guess the median is 2 percent at the end of 2023.  So, you know, you know what the guidance says.  It says that we expect that the current setting of, of our rates will be—what we expect [is] that it will be appropriate until such time as we reach 2 percent inflation, that we feel that labor market conditions are consistent with our assessment of maximum employment, and that we’re on track to achieve inflation moderate—inflation moderately above.  So that’s the test.  So I don’t think there’s any conflict between those two because, you know, the, the way they’re set up, the projections don’t show the out years. You asked about confidence, and I would say that this, this very strong, very powerful guidance shows both our confidence and our determination.  It shows our confidence that we can reach this goal and our determination to do so. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  I’m sorry, if I could just follow up without being simplistic about this.  But why wouldn’t—if the Committee was confident that it could reach its new goal of aiming for inflation above 2 percent, why wouldn’t one of those years at least show inflation being above 2 percent on the median forecast? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Because it—we think, looking at everything we know about inflation dynamics in the United States and around the world over recent decades, we expect it will take some time.  We expect that the economy will recover quickly now, but that that pace will slow as, as people go back to work.  And we’ll still have an area of the economy—a big area of the economy—that struggles.  There will be slack in the economy.  The economy will be below  September 16, 2020  maximum employment, below full demand.  And that will tend to wear—to put downward   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL pressure on inflation.  So we think that once we get up closer to maximum employment, we think that inflation will come back, generally.  And, I mean, that’s sort of what happened during the last long expansion.  It’s a slow process, but—but there is a process there.  Inflation does move up over time.  We do expect that will continue today, and we expect that our, our guidance is powerful and will help that outcome.  We think that—that effectively saying that policy will remain highly accommodative until the economy is very far along in its recovery should provide strong support for the economy and get us there sooner rather than later. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Rachel Siegel. 

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks very much for taking my question.  I wanted to ask if you anticipate a slowing in the pace of the recovery if there is not another stimulus package and, specifically, if there are particular holes still remaining in the economy that you think could be helped by more aid from Congress.  Thanks very much. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So, first, if you look at the Summary of Economic Projections that my colleagues and I filed for this meeting, what you’ll see is an expectation that the recovery will continue—that it will continue at a reasonable pace through 2021, ’22, and ’23.  We do expect that that pace will slow just because you would expect that the, the pace would be fastest right at the beginning of the—right at the beginning of the recovery, because you had such a sharp decline.  You would expect that the third quarter should be the fastest gains, and that, after that, the pace should slow down to a more normal pace.  So we do expect that. In terms of fiscal policy—you asked about fiscal policy.  So, you know, one thing—I guess I would start by saying that the initial response from fiscal authorities was rapid.  It was  September 16, 2020  forceful and pretty effective.  And we’re seeing the results of that in—today in income and   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL household spending data, in the labor market data, in the construction data, in the data for business equipment spending, and the fact that businesses are staying in business, and, you know, the pace of default and things like that has really slowed.  So there’s been a really positive effect. That said, my sense is that more fiscal support is likely to be needed.  Of course, the details of that are for Congress, not for the Fed.  But I would just say, there are still roughly 11 million people still out of work due to the pandemic, and a good part of those people were working in industries that are likely to struggle.  Those people may need additional, additional support as they try to find their way through what will be a difficult time for them.  We’ve also got struggling small businesses, especially those in the business of facing directly to the public.  And we have state and local governments dealing with a drop in revenue at the same time spending has gone up, much of it related to the pandemic and economic effects.  So, again, I would say, the fiscal support has been essential in, in the good progress we see now. And, finally, I’ll note that just about all—the overwhelming majority of, of private forecasters who, who project an ongoing recovery are assuming there will be substantial additional fiscal support. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Mike Derby. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  [Inaudible] taking my question.  Should we expect any further evolutions in forward guidance, say, maybe an adoption of something akin to the Evans rule that we had a few years ago?  Or is there something else that the Fed might be considering in the future?  September 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so we think that the forward guidance we adopted today is appropriate and, as I mentioned, powerful.  Effectively, what it says is that we’ll, we will keep policy where it is now—keep the rate policy where it is now until unemployment reaches the Committee’s assessments or levels that are—sorry, not unemployment, labor market conditions reach levels that are consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment, until inflation reaches 2 percent, and until it’s on track to go above 2 percent moderately for some time.  So that’s very strong forward guidance, and we think that that will be durable guidance that will provide significant support to the economy in coming years.  So that’s, that’s really our thinking on, on forward guidance on rates. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Howard Schneider. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks.  Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing this.  So to follow up on Mike’s question there, since you described this guidance as durable, you—you’ve set up a three-part test here for rate hikes:  levels consistent with assessments of maximum employment, inflation has risen to 2 percent, and you’re on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.  Each of these have modifiers, and I wonder if you could explain them a little bit more.  How do we pin down assessments of maximum employment?  When you say that “inflation has risen to 2 percent,” does that mean 2 percent for a day, a month, six months?  And when you say “on track to moderately exceed,” how should we define “moderately”?  And how should we define “for some time”? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, as you know, maximum employment is not—is not something that can be reduced to a number the way inflation can.  It’s a broad range of factors.  It really always has been and, really, a substantial number of factors that we’ve indicated we would look at.  So it’s broader labor conditions, consistent with our Committee’s assessment of maximum  September 16, 2020  employment.  So that would certainly mean low unemployment, it would mean high labor force   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   participation, it would mean wages—it would be a whole range of things.  And we’re not looking at a rule.  We’re looking at a judgmental assessment, which I think we’ll be very transparent about as we—as we go forward. In terms of inflation, you know, this is a Committee that is both confident and committed to—and determined to reach our goals.  And the idea that we would look for the, the quickest way out is just—it’s just not who we are.  It’s not that—there’s no message of that here.  We would not be looking for one month of 2 percent inflation; we said return to 2—to achieve 2 percent inflation.  Okay.  So just understand that, you know, we’re strongly committed to achieving our goals and the overshoot.  So that should tell you about that. Oh, in terms of—okay, in terms of—so, what does “moderate” mean?  It means not large.  It doesn’t—it means not very high above 2 percent.  It means moderate.  I think that’s a fairly well-understood word.  In terms of—in terms of “for a time,” what it means is not permanently and not for a sustained period.  You know, we’re, we’re resisting the urge to try to create some sort of a rule or a formula here.  And I think the, the public will understand pretty well what we want.  It’s actually pretty straightforward.  We want to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time.  And if we do that, inflation expectations will be right at 2 percent, and that’ll help us achieve 2 percent inflation over time and avoid the situation where the central bank loses its ability to support the economy. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  James Politi. 

[SECTION]

JAMES POLITI.  Thanks for taking the question.  James Politi with the Financial Times.  Do you consider today’s enhanced forward guidance to have actual accommodation to the—to the U.S. economy from a monetary perspective and sort of deliver further support for the  September 16, 2020  economy?  Or is it just a tweak to your existing policy stance?  And, in terms of fiscal support,   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL do you assume in your own projections—not just, you know, private forecasters—that additional fiscal support will be forthcoming?  Or do you expect weaker growth or a—or a larger contraction rather this year if no fiscal support is forthcoming? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, in terms of the effects, so I think what we’ve done is—is more or less aligned with the consensus statement today.  So it’s, it’s in line with what, what might have been expected.  As I mentioned, I think over time it will provide very powerful support for this economy as we move forward.  In a sense, it’s consistent with expectations, so I don’t—I’m not looking for a big reaction right now.  But I think, over time, again, guidance that we expect to retain the current stance until the economy is—has moved very far toward our goals is a strong and powerful thing.  And I think that will be supportive of the economy over time. In terms of additional fiscal support, I guess your question is, what would happen if—yes, so, people have different assessments, and, and different participants in the FOMC made different assessments on their own.  I think broadly, though, there is an expectation among private forecasters and among FOMC participants that there will be some further fiscal action.  And there does seem to be an appetite on the part of all the relevant players to doing something.  The question is, how much and when? And so I would just say that if—and it’s very hard to say.  So, so far the economy has proven resilient to the—to the lapsing of the—to the, of the CARES Act unemployment—enhanced unemployment benefits.  But there’s, there’s certainly a risk, though, that, that those who are unemployed have saved—appear to have saved some of those benefits, and they’ll, they’ll now spend them, and that, as the months pass, if, if there’s no follow-up on that, if there isn’t additional support and there isn’t a job for the—some of those people who are, are from  September 16, 2020  industries where, where it’s going to be very hard to find new work, then you’ll—that will start   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   to show up in economic activity.  It’ll also show up in things like evictions and foreclosures and, and, you know, things that will scar and damage the economy.  So that’s a downside risk. So I, I think the real question is, is, when and how much and what will be the—what will be the contents?  And, you know, no one—no one has any certainty around that, but, broadly speaking, if we don’t get that, then there would certainly be downside risks through the—certainly through the channel I mentioned. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Anneken, CNN. 

[SECTION]

ANNEKEN TAPPE.  Thanks for taking my question.  Chairman Powell, given the recent update to the policy framework and repeated calls for this in the Fed Listens events, is the Fed open to other measures of the economy, such as income inequality and affordability of housing? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we—you know, we monitor everything we think is important in the U.S. economy.  And in that—in a broad sense, all of it goes into thinking about monetary policy.  You mentioned inequality.  So, you know, disparities in, in income and in financial well-being by various demographic and racial categories is something we monitor carefully.  Inequality, which I would point to—it’s a multifaceted thing.  But I would point to the relative stagnation of incomes for people at the lower end of the income spectrum and also lower mobility.  So those are things that hold back our economy.  They are. The thing is, we don’t really have the tools to address those.  We, we have interest rates and bank supervision and financial stability policy and things like that, but we can’t—we can’t get at those things through our tools.  When we lower the federal funds rate, that supports the economy across a broad range of, of people and activities, but we can’t—we don’t have the ability to target particular groups.  September 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL Notwithstanding that, we, we do talk about it, because these are important features of our economy.  And we—you know, I, I think those are—those distributional issues are, are issues that are really for our elected officials.  And I would say, I take them seriously as holding back our economy.  The productive capacity of the economy is limited when not everyone has the opportunity, has the educational background and, and the health care and all the things that you need to be an active participant in our workforce.  So I think we can—if we want to have the, the highest potential output and the—and the best output for our economy, we need that prosperity to be very broadly spread in the longer run. And I—again, I would just say, the Fed—you know, we can talk about those things a lot.  And in, in—when we think about maximum employment in particular, we do look at individual groups.  So high unemployment in a particular racial group like African Americans when—you know, we would look at that as we think about whether we’re really at maximum employment.  We would look—we would look at that along with a lot of other data.  So the answer is, we do look at all those things and, and do what we can with our tools.  But, ultimately, these are issues for elected representatives. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Edward Lawrence. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Yes, thank you, Chairman Powell, for the question.  I just wanted some clarity here.  At what point do you think it’s prudent to shift the bond purchases from market stability—as you had said, from the shorter-term maturities to more longer-term, more stimulus-related? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, we think our—we think that our asset purchases are doing both the thing—both those things today.  We think, clearly, there’s been great progress, in terms of market function.  If you remember, early in the spring when the acute phase of the  September 16, 2020  pandemic hit, market function was very low.  And it’s improved rapidly and, and in many   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL respects is, is in a good place now.  We also, though, think that these asset purchases, which total $120 billion a month—you know, which is much larger than, for example, the last asset purchase program during the Global Financial Crisis and the recovery therefrom—we think that that’s also providing accommodative financial conditions and supporting growth.  And we think that’s fine. We’re also aware that we, we—there are ways we can adjust that, you know, to do various things—you know, make it smaller, make it larger, and also target different sectors of the—of the curve.  And, you know, we’re, we’re going to continue to monitor developments, and we’re prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate.

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  I wanted to ask about a couple of things.  First of all, if we don’t get a vaccine until well into next year, what does that mean for the economy?  And then, somewhat related, I was wondering if you could provide any more detail about the stress scenarios that you all are going to release for the big banks and whether that is going to be another full-blown stress test, whether we’re going to publicly see those results, and what it might mean for bank payouts. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Great.  So, on the first one, what’s happening is basically we’re learning to live with—right now, we're learning to live with COVID, which still spreads.  And we’re learning to, to engage in economic activity.  All of this recovery that we’ve seen is in a context where—you know, where people are still at risk of, of catching it, and yet we’re able to resume lots and lots of economic activities.  And that involves, as I mentioned, you know—I think the more social distancing we can preserve as we go back into the workforce—wearing masks, keeping our distance, that kind of thing—the better we’ll be able to get economic activity  September 16, 2020  back up close to where it was.  I do think, though, there are areas of the economy that are just   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL going to really struggle until we have an—a vaccine that’s, that’s in wide—you know, wide usage and is, is widely trusted.  And those are the ones where people were getting really closely—close together. I also think testing—to the extent you have cheap and rapid testing, you can do a lot with that in the workforce.  You can—you can build confidence in the workforce if you have regular—very regular testing that doesn’t cost very much and you get the results really quickly.  If you do that, you’ll be able to open a lot of workforces, particularly in cities where the overall case numbers are quite low.  And that will help a lot. So I think we’re, we’re going to be finding lots and lots of ways to get out towards—you know, as far as we can.  There’s always going to be that—for, for some time, there’s going to be certain activities that will be—that will be hard to, to resume.  So I, I think that’s the only way I can say it.  And I think trying to—you know, we all—when we make a forecast, we make assessments about that, but it’s really hard to say.  There is no template here.  There’s no—you know, there’s no experience with this. So, frankly, for the last 60 days or so, the economy’s recovered faster than expected.  And that may continue or not.  We just don’t know.  And I think we should do those things that we control to make sure that we can recover as quickly as possible.  And the main thing, again, is wearing a mask and keeping your distance while you’re in the workforce.  That’s something we can all do that will limit the spread and let people go back to work, avoid major outbreaks, and things like that.  September 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL In, in terms of the stress tests, so I really don’t have any—you know, we’re getting ready quite soon to be making announcements and saying things publicly.  There’s not much I can say with you—nothing, really, that I can say that’s—on that today.  I don’t have anything for you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Chris Condon. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER CONDON.  Thank you, Michelle.  Good afternoon, Chairman Powell.  You have emphasized many times, including today, that the Fed can only lend and not spend, and sometimes the latter is what’s really needed.  But to the extent that a $600 billion lending program for small and midsize companies could help, what exactly is wrong with the design or function of the Main Street Lending Program, which has purchased just, I think, $1.4 billion in loans so far? Eric Rosengren at the Boston Fed has said recently that Congress should clarify how much risk it wants the program to take.  But Congress has already appropriated substantial funds for the 13(3) programs, and these are funds that are explicitly designed to absorb losses.  Meanwhile, my colleagues who cover the banking sector say they’re being told by commercial banks that the Treasury Department is advising them to target zero losses—zero losses in Main Street Program loans.  So, if I may, why is it that the Federal Reserve, the Congress, and the Treasury apparently cannot agree on a loss tolerance that should be applied to the Main Street Lending Program in a way that would allow badly needed credit to reach these companies?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So, a couple things about Main Street.  It, it reaches the whole nation.  It’s got more than half of the banking industry assets signed up among the banks that are part of it, and it’s making loans.  The number is more like—it’s close to $2 billion now.  So the numbers are going up.  Banks are joining; borrowers are coming.  And it’s significant.  It’s, it’s  September 16, 2020  relatively small now, but it can scale up in response to economic conditions, should that be—  Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL should that be appropriate.  You know, if you look out in the lending world, surveys generally find that, that firms are not citing credit constraints as a top problem.  And that, that is a lot of PPP, bank credit lines, and syndicated loans.  There’s a lot of credit being let out there. So—but you’re right.  We, we are looking at some things.  We’re looking at—some lenders are concerned about the underwriting expectations.  So banks are going to—their approach is likely to be that they’re going to underwrite this loan roughly the same as they underwrite any loan.  They’re keeping part of it, and, you know, what, what we want to do is make sure that—that they know that they should take the payment deferrals and other things in, in place, and also that—you know, it’s, it’s really—it’s really a, a facility for, for companies or borrowers that, that don’t have access to, to “regular way” borrowing now.  Otherwise, why would we need Main Street? So that’s what we're working on.  And we’ll be doing some, some—we’ll be making some changes in that respect.  I don’t—I saw what President Rosengren said.  I, I can’t really comment directly on that.  I just would say that, you know, this is 13(3).  If you look at the law under section 13(3), it’s very clear that we are to make loans only to solvent borrowers.  And, and the CARES Act is quite specific in keeping all of the terms of, of section 13(3) in effect, including the requirement that we, you know, gather good evidence that the borrower is solvent.  This was—this law was amended in, you know, under—in Dodd-Frank, and the idea was, was to make it challenging and put hurdles in place before we made loans—at the time, the thinking was to banks. So now we—now we’re using that same law for, for smaller business borrowers, and, you know, it doesn’t—it’s not a perfect fit.  And, and, I would also just say, for many borrowers,  September 16, 2020  they’re in a situation where their business is still relatively shut down, and they won’t be able to   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   service a loan, and so they may need more fiscal support.  Having said that, we’re, we’re continuing to work to, to improve Main Street, to make it more broadly available—make it pretty much to any company that needs it and that can service a loan. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER CONDON.  And can you just very briefly address the reports that the Treasury is advising banks to target zero losses?  Is that appropriate? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I can’t say.  I don’t—I don’t know about that.  I haven’t heard those reports.  You know, again, if you think about it, we, we weren’t—we’re, we’re going to have to go through the banking system to do this.  We—we’re not going to have a hundred thousand or a million loan officers working for the Fed and the Treasury.  So we’re going to go through the banking system, and the banks—banks like to make good loans.  That’s what they do.  They’re trained to make good loans.  So you should expect that they—and we expect that they will do some underwriting.  We also want them to take some risk, obviously, because that was the point of it.  And the question is, how do you dial that in?  It’s, it’s not an easy thing to do.  And, you know, we’re getting some loans made, and we’re hopeful that we’ll, that we’ll clarify this and that credit will continue to flow. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi, thanks for taking my question.  Chair Powell, you’ve talked a couple of times about parts of the economy that may not recover as fast as we’ve seen so far.  Presumably you’re referring to airlines, hotels, other sections—you know, parts of the economy that rely on close contact.  How are you thinking about that, in terms of its overall impact?  Is that sector large enough to say keep unemployment above—you know, far above your maximum goals?  Are you expecting that to come back with a vaccine?  Or are a lot of  September 16, 2020  those folks going to have to find, you know, new jobs in new industries?  And should we expect   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   the Fed will keep rates at zero until all of that reallocation is done?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, we—of  course, we can’t be—we can’t be really sure we know the answers to those questions.  But I would say, the, the likely path is that the—that the expansion will continue.  And it’s, as I said, it’s well along, and it’ll move most easily through the parts of the economy—it’ll still take some time, but the parts of the economy that weren’t exactly directly affected, that didn’t involve getting people in large groups together to feed them, to fly them around, to put them in hotels, do entertainment, things like that—those are going to be the places that are—that are very challenging.  So there will also be the—you know, the places that are affected that way.  And that’s going to be challenging for, for some time.  It just is.  And we don’t really know how long that will be. It’s—you know, it’s millions of people.  As I mentioned, we had 11 million—something like 11 million people in the payroll survey have gone back to work out of 22 million who went—who lost their jobs in March and April.  So that’s half of them.  So, 11 million—particularly if the pace of, of returning to work slows down, it’s going to leave a large—a large group of people.  And it’ll be very meaningful from a macroeconomic standpoint.  And our commitment is not to forget those people.  As I mentioned, we want—you know, the sense of our forward guidance is that policy will remain, as we’ve said, highly accommodative until the—until the expansion is well along—really, very close to our goals.  And even after, if we do lift off, we will keep policy accommodative until we actually have a moderate overshoot of inflation for some time.  So those are powerful commitments that we think will, will support the full recovery, including those people, as long as it takes. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Mike McKee.  September 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  Based on what you were just saying about keeping policy accommodative for a very long time into the recovery, lower-for-longer as far out as three years in your latest projections, is that basically it for the Fed?  In other words, since interest rates are your main tool, the things you can do would push down on interest rates.  But is it really—is it the case now that the only additional stimulus that can come to the economy is from the fiscal side? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, no, I wouldn’t—I certainly would not say that we’re out of ammo.  Not at all.  So, first of all, we, we do have lots of tools.  We’ve got the lending tools, we’ve got the balance sheet, and we’ve got further forward guidance—further forward guidance.  So we, we—there’s still plenty more that we can do.  We do think that our—that our, our rate policy stance is an appropriate one to support the economy.  We think it’s powerful.  And, as I mentioned, you know, this is the kind of guidance that will provide support for the economy over time, the idea being that policy will remain highly accommodative until the recovery is well along—really, very close to our goals—and then will remain accommodative even after we lift off.  So I think that’s, that’s a really strong place for, for rate policy to be.  But, again, we have the other margins that we can still use.  So, no.  Certainly, we’re not out of ammo. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Well, if I could follow up, in terms of the balance sheet, are you concerned that your actions are more likely to produce asset price inflation than goods-and-services inflation?  In other words, are you risking a bubble on Wall Street? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so, of course we monitor financial conditions very carefully.  These are—these are not new questions.  These were questions that were very much in the air a decade ago and more when, when the Fed first started doing QE.  And, I would say, if you look at the long experience of, you know, the 10-year, 8-month expansion, the longest in our  September 16, 2020  recorded history, it included an awful lot of quantitative easing and low rates for 7 years.  And, I   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   would say, it was notable for the lack of the emergence of, of some sort of a financial bubble—a housing bubble or some kind of a bubble, the popping of which could threaten the expansion.  That didn’t happen.  And, frankly, it hasn’t really happened around the world since then.  That doesn’t mean that it won’t happen, but—and so, of course, it’s something that we monitor carefully. After the financial crisis, we started a new—a whole division of the Fed to focus on financial stability.  We look at it in every—from every perspective.  The FOMC gets briefed on a quarterly basis.  At the Board here, we talk about it more or less on an ongoing basis, so it is something we monitor.  But I don’t know that the—that the connection between asset purchases and, and financial stability is a particularly tight one.  So—but again, we won’t be—we won’t be just assuming that.  We’ll be checking carefully as we go.  And, by the way, the kinds of tools that we would use to address those sorts of things are not really monetary policy.  It would be more tools that strengthen the financial system. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Don Lee. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Chair Powell, I’d like to ask you about the labor market.  As you know, in report for August showed about 13½ million unemployed, only about 6 million more than before the pandemic.  I wonder how you reconcile that and what you think the actual labor market conditions are. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, I mean, I think the overall picture—take a step back from this.  The overall picture is clear, and that is that the labor market has been recovering, but that it’s a long way—a long way from maximum employment.  I think that’s, that’s the bottom line on it.   September 16, 2020  So, within that, though—take claims in particular.  The number of claims, the quantity of claims,   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   and, frankly, the fact that PUA claims are new—the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance claims—that’s a new system that had to be set up.  The actual counting of the claims is, is volatile, and, and it’s very difficult to take much signal about the particular level.  So, you know, because people were setting those systems up, and when they got them set up, they counted them all at once and things like that. I think, though, what you’ve seen is that the level of—certainly the level of initial claims has declined very sharply from the very high levels of March and April and is now at a lower level—continues either to be flat or gradually decline.  It’s worth noting—and that’s good—it’s worth noting that that level is maybe five times the level of what claims were.  Claims were around 200,000; now they’re 900,000, in that range, weekly for, for initial claims.  So that just tells you, the labor market has improved, but it’s a long, long way from maximum employment, and it will be some time getting back there.  I think that’s the best way to think about it.  In many parts of the economy there’s just a lot of disruption, and it’s, it’s really hard to say precisely where we are. I’ll give you another example with—you know, we say unemployment’s 8.4 percent.  But if you count those who are—who are misidentified as, as employed when they’re actually unemployed and you add back some part of the participation number—so if you were—if you had a job and you were in the labor force in February and you lost it because of the pandemic, some of you are now being reported as out of the labor force.  But I—you know, I would—I would more look at those people as unemployed.  If you add those back, the level of unemployment’s probably 3 percent higher.  On the other hand, by that metric, the, the  September 16, 2020  unemployment rate would have been in the—in the 20s in, in April.  So the improvement has   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL been quite substantial under any measurement.  But the level is still quite high. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Well, if I could follow up, is—is it the Fed’s aim to get back to 3.5 percent or even lower? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, absolutely.  You know, I, I can’t be precise about a particular number, but let me just say, there was a lot to like about 3½ percent unemployment.  It’s not a magic number.  No one would say that number is the touchstone or that is, you know, maximum employment.  I would just say, you asked about 3½ percent.  A 3½ percent unemployment rate showed, you know, gains being shared very widely across the income spectrum—in fact, going more to people at the bottom end of the spectrum.  It showed labor force participation coming up as—up above many estimates of its trend, as people who’d been out of the labor force were being pulled into a tight job market.  There’s a lot to like about a tough—a tight job market, particularly in a world where we didn’t see inflation.  So, yes, we’d love to get back to that. I mean, I would say, we would like to get back—rather than to a particular number, we’d like to get back to a strong labor market where wages are moving up, where people can find work, where labor force participation is holding up nicely.  That’s what we’d really love to get back to.  Now, of course we would—we need inflation to perform in line with, with our framework.  But the good news is, we think we can have quite low unemployment without raising troubling inflation. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Hi, Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, I want to follow up on the wealth gap issue.  I know you were—that you have limited  September 16, 2020  tools.  But are there things that you can do, possibly in the area of research and maybe expand   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL your research on racial economic gaps? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we do—we are gifted with a, a substantial group of researchers who really cover the waterfront.  And we do a significant amount of research on racial disparities in—across multiple variables, including wealth, as you asked about.  So we do that.  And we also—remember, we have our Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, which is present in communities around the country.  And the Reserve Banks all have very active community affairs groups.  They’re present in communities around the country.  So it wasn’t just the Fed—Fed Listens events.  It’s more, just, over a long period of time we, we are in contact with people in those communities to understand their experience of the economy. We serve all Americans, and we know that.  And we’re going to use our tools to, to reflect that fact.  So the answer is “yes.”  We do quite a bit of research, and I suppose we could do more, but we really do a lot.  And we contribute to those fields and those assessments of, of the state of the economy.  And we do that not just because it’s interesting and important, but because it’s important for the economy and important for our mandate. We are assigned “maximum employment.”  Now, what does that mean?  As I mentioned earlier, it doesn’t mean a particular headline unemployment number.  What it means is maximum employment.  So, you know, we look at—look at that in many, many different variables, and we ask ourselves whether those variables are—those labor market conditions are consistent with our assessments of what would constitute maximum employment.  And that would include all of the things that we’re talking about. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Greg Robb.  September 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Hi, Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Thanks for this.  I want to go back to the new forward guidance that you have.  And you said that it’s powerful, but you’ve already have two dissent—two dissenting voters on it.  And I was wondering if there’s other, other people who argued against it.  And what do you say to the two who dissented?  It looks like President Kashkari wanted a simpler forward guidance, and President Kaplan thought that the current guidance you have was fine for now.  So, like, how did you argue back on those, on those arguments?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I wouldn’t—I don’t want to comment particularly on, on the two dissenters, but they, they consent—they dissented from, of course, different perspectives, and, and that should be clear.  That’s their—they’re not—they’re sort of on, on two sides of the, of the discussion.  But I would say this:  I am blessed with having a Committee of highly thoughtful people who bring diverse life experiences and diverse careers, and, of course, diverse views to our work.  And I wouldn’t have it any other way.  I wouldn’t.  So, so I would just say, the right—in our discussions the last couple of days, the whole Committee, everybody on the Committee is very supportive of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and what’s in there—very, very broad support, unanimous support for that.  Everyone sees the, the changes in the underlying economy and sees, in their own way, the need to address those—and including the changes we made to the employment mandate and to inflation so that we’re now at flexible average inflation targeting. Of course, there would be—this is—you know, we’re the first major central bank to adopt this framework.  There’s no cookbook, and we—you know, this is the first guidance under our new framework.  So, of course there would be a wide range of views, and you would expect that.  And it’s actually a healthy thing.  So I welcome that discussion.  I would also say this:  You  September 16, 2020  know, this is all about credibility, and we understand perfectly that we have to earn credibility.    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   This, this facility—this, this framework has to—we have to support it with our actions.  And I think today is a very good first step in doing that. It is strong, powerful guidance.  It is—it ties in very nicely with the Statement of [on] Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.  We had quite a robust discussion, and there are, there are different ideas on how to do this, but I—that’s just, that’s just the way it is when you have a diverse group of highly thoughtful and effective people.  And so I’m pleased with where it came out. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Hannah Lang. 

[SECTION]

HANNAH LANG.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks so much for taking my question.  I wanted to ask about commercial real estate.  I, I know you had mentioned before how you weren’t sure if there was a way the Fed could support CRE borrowers.  But I was just wondering if you had—if you’ve had any other continuing discussions on that and if there’s any potential way that the Fed could step in in that area. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So thank you for that question.  You know, we’ve actually spent quite a bit of time on this as Secretary Mnuchin, I think, mentioned the other day.  And I’ll say just a couple things.  First, you know, our facilities are essentially always—they have to be, under the law—broad based and not so much targeting any single sector.  Also, it’s important to remember that CRE, commercial real estate, benefits from several of our existing facilities.  So the TALF takes commercial mortgage-backed securities and SBA commercial real estate deals.  And the New York Fed purchases agency CMBSs directly.  In addition, I would say, Main Street helps businesses pay their rent, you know.  So we’re, we’re helping real estate, you know, in a number of other ways—commercial real estate.  September 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL Also, CMBS issuance has resumed.  Spreads have tightened on CMBS.  There are a couple of issues.  One is just that commercial properties with CMBS loans often have covenants—uniformly, I think, have covenants that forbid them to take on more debt.  So you have a situation, and you have a situation where, where you—without a legal change or some kind of an innovation that defies discovery so far, you’re—you have a hard time providing mass relief with regard to real estate that’s in, in commercial mortgage-backed securities.  So we’re still working on it.  We’re still looking.  I would say, it may be that further support for commercial real estate will require further action for Congress—from Congress. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  For the last question, we’ll go to Brian Cheung. 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  So it seems like a lot of the new inflation framework is about shaping inflation expectations.  But the average American who might be watching this might be confused as to why the Fed is overshooting inflation.  So what’s your explanation to Main Street, to average people what the Fed is trying to do here and what the outcome would be for those on Main Street?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  That’s a very, very important question, and I actually spoke about that in my Jackson Hole remarks a couple weeks ago.  It’s not intuitive to people.  It is intuitive that, that high inflation is a bad thing.  It’s less intuitive that inflation can be too low.  And the way I would explain it is, is that inflation that’s too low will mean that interest rates are lower.  There’s an expectation of future inflation that’s built into every interest rate, right?  And to the extent inflation gets lower and lower and lower, interest rates get lower and lower.  And then the Fed will have less room to cut rates to support the economy.  And this isn’t some idle, you know, academic theory.  This is what’s happening all over the world.  If you, if you look at many, many large jurisdictions around the world, you are seeing that phenomenon.  September 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL So we want inflation to be—we want it to be 2 percent, and we want it to average 2 percent.  So if inflation averages 2 percent, the public will expect that, and that’ll be what’s built into interest rates.  And that’s just—that’s all we want.  So we’re not looking to have high inflation.  We just want inflation to average 2 percent.  And that means that, you know, in a downturn, these days, what happens is, inflation, as has happened now—it moves down well below 2 percent.  And that means that we’ve said for, for—we would like to see and we will conduct policies so that inflation moves, for some time, moderately above 2 percent.  So it won’t be—these won’t be large overshoots, and they won’t be permanent but to help anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent.  So, yes, it’s, it’s a challenging concept for a lot of people.  But, nonetheless, the economic importance of it is, is large.  And, you know, those are the people we’re serving, and, you know, we serve them best if we can actually achieve average 2 percent inflation, we believe.  And that’s why we changed our framework.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you very much.

CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks very much.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
39,2020-11-05,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us—maximum employment and price stability.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.  Today my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I reaffirmed our commitment to support the economy in this challenging time. Economic activity has continued to recover from its depressed second-quarter level.  The reopening of the economy led to a rapid rebound in activity, and real GDP rose at an annual rate of 33 percent in the third quarter.  In recent months, however, the pace of improvement has moderated.  Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been strong and has moved above its pre-pandemic level.  In contrast, spending on services remains low, largely due to ongoing weakness in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality.  The overall rebound in household spending owes, in part, to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many families and individuals.  The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates.  Business investment has also picked up.  Even so, overall economic activity remains well below its level before the pandemic, and the path ahead remains highly uncertain. In the labor market, roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April have been regained, as many people were able to return to work.  As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated.  The unemployment rate  November 5, 2020  Although we welcome this progress, we will not lose sight of the millions of Americans who   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL remain out of work.  The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit.  In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the services sector, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics.  The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.  Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer, in part reflecting a rise in durable goods prices.  However, for those sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft.  Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective. As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on the success of efforts to keep the virus in check.  The recent rise in new COVID-19 cases, both here in the United States and abroad, is particularly concerning.  All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic.  Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength.  A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it’s safe to reengage in a broad range of activities. The Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  As noted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a “broad-based and inclusive goal.”  Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on  November 5, 2020  having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.  As we said in September   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL and again today, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.  We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.  With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, over coming months we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace.  These asset purchases are intended to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.  At this meeting, my colleagues and I discussed our asset purchases and the role they are playing in supporting the recovery.  At the current pace, our holdings of securities are rising at a substantial rate of $120 billion per month—$80 billion per month of Treasuries and $40 billion per month of agency MBS.  We believe these purchases, along with the very large purchases made to preserve financial stability in the depths of the crisis, have materially eased financial conditions and are providing substantial support to the economy.  Looking ahead, we will continue to monitor developments and assess how our ongoing asset purchases can best support our maximum-employment and price-stability objectives as well as market functioning and financial stability.  November 5, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local governments.  Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating damage to the economy and promoting a robust recovery.  Many of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today.  These programs serve as a backstop to key credit markets and have helped to restore the flow of credit from private lenders through normal channels.  We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury.  When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox. As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers.  The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.  We can only create programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid.  Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy.  But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer.  In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.  Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources.  The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country.  Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes.  It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.  November 5, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL I’d like to mention a couple of changes that we plan on making to our Summary of Economic Projections beginning in December.  First, we will release the entire package of SEP materials at the same time that the FOMC statement comes out.  Previously, some of these materials were released three weeks after the meeting as part of the minutes.  This step will make more information available at the time of our policy announcements, including the distributions of forecasts and how participants judge the uncertainty and risks that attend their projections.  Second, we will add two new graphs that show how the balance of participants’ assessments of uncertainty and risks have evolved over time.  These changes to the SEP will provide a timely perspective on the risks and uncertainties that surround the modal or baseline projections, thereby highlighting some of the risk-management considerations that are relevant for monetary policy. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  It’s Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.  Thanks very much for taking my question.  I’m wondering if you can speak specifically about what indicators you’re seeing that suggest the pace of improvement has moderated, including in the labor market, and how correlated those indicators are to the recent rise in COVID cases that we’ve seen going into flu season.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So, of course.  Let’s start with February.  In February, we had an economy that was performing well.  Then the pandemic hit, and we had a record decline in  November 5, 2020  activity in March and April, and then we had a record bounceback in May and June.  And so as I   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   think would have been expected and was expected, the pace of improvement from May and June has now moderated, so it’s not unexpected.  And I think if you look at just about anything, you know, for example, the payroll readings, the payroll job gains in May and June were just outsized.  And they’re certainly still very large, but they’ve—but the pace of improvement has moderated.  That’s the case for, for all different measures in the labor force—in the labor market, rather.  Another would be claims.  Just about all the data were—showed a big bounceback.  But then, as you would expect, when, when you sort of had people—a lot of people go back to work at once, the pace will moderate.  Same thing with economic activity.  Most forecasts call for, you know, still a significant growth in the fourth quarter but not at the 33 percent annualized pace that we had in the third quarter.  So, in a sense, that would be—that would be as expected.  We have been concerned that the downside risks, though, are, are prevalent now, which are—which are really the risk of the further spread of the disease and also the risk that, that households will run through the savings they’ve managed to accumulate on their balance sheet and that that could weigh on activity.  But what we see up to the present, really, is, continued growth, continued expansion, but at, at a gradually moderating pace. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press. the stimulus package that is being debated in Congress is and how severe a threat that could be to the economy if it does not get passed, say, before January? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So it is—obviously, it’s for Congress to decide the timing, size, and components of further fiscal support for the economy, and I will say that the support provided by the CARES Act was absolutely essential in supporting the recovery that we’ve seen so far, which  November 5, 2020  has generally exceeded expectations.  And I do think it’s likely that further support is likely to be   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   needed for monetary policy and fiscal policy.  I just mentioned the two risks that I think we, we face, and those would be well addressed through more fiscal policy.  One is the further spread of the virus, and the other is the lapsing of the CARES Act benefits and the savings on people’s balance sheets that will dwindle.  But I, you know, I think it’s appropriate for us not to try to prescribe for Congress exactly what they should do or what the timing of it should be or what the size of it should be and leave it at that.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick Timiraos. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.  To follow on Marty’s question, you really have been saying since April that more is needed on the fiscal policy front, and yet we don’t seem to be that much closer than we were in the spring or the summer to additional spending.  Two questions:  Would the lack of fiscal support compel the Fed to provide additional accommodation, and are you and your colleagues being more vocal about the need for fiscal support because the capacity for monetary policy to support growth is diminished here, given the low level of short- and long-term rates?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So on your first question, you know, we’ll take into account all external factors and, and do what we think we need to do with the tools that we have to pursue our goals.  That’s what we will do.  And I’ve said it on a couple of occasions that that will go better and move more quickly if we have a broad set of policies from across the government.  And we’ve said this in the very beginning:  It’s really, first and foremost, health-care policy, getting the—getting the spread of the virus under control and working on therapeutics and vaccines and that kind of thing, getting—so that—those are absolutely critical to the economy.  Now, those are important, as well as health policies.  They’re, they’re going to be critical to the  November 5, 2020  economy.  Fiscal policy can do what we can’t, which is to replace lost incomes for people who   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL are out of work through no fault of their own.  And then we—what we can do is, we can obviously support financial stability through our lending programs, and, and we can support demand through, through interest rates and asset purchases and that sort of thing.  So we’re, we’re going to take the economy as it comes, including all external factors. So I think all of us lived through the experience of the—of the years after the Global Financial Crisis.  And for a number of years there, in the middle of the recovery, fiscal policy was pretty tight.  And. and I think I just would say that I think we’ll have a stronger recovery if we can just get at least some more fiscal support when it’s appropriate, you know, when it’s appropriate and in the size Congress thinks is appropriate.  I do think that that will likely—and, by the way, you see, you know, a lot of discussion on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Hill that suggests generally that there will be something. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Steve Liesman, CNBC. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, also to follow up on sort of what Nick was talking about, two questions about quantitative easing.  The first is, if the market is functioning better, as you and other Fed officials have said, and QE right now is designed for smooth market functioning, why haven’t you reduced QE that you’re doing if the market is functioning better already?  The second question I have is, what good, for the broader economy, would additional QE do at this point, given that interest rates are already low and don’t seem to be rising even above 1 percent?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, on the first—the first question, it’s—our asset purchases are serving both purchases, both—sorry, both purposes:  financial market function and support for economic activity.  So—and that’s really been true—I think in the very beginning of the crisis,  November 5, 2020  the main focus was, obviously, financial, financial market function, particularly in, in, you know,   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   some of the major markets.  But after that period, we’ve, we’ve understood all along that our purchases are also supporting economic activity, and that’s important.  And that need hasn’t dwindled at all.  So, so we haven’t looked at reducing purchases. So in terms of what they can do, first I would just say, the purchases that we have in place are providing strong support to economic activity still.  And, by the way, they’re sustaining the gains we’ve made in financial stability.  You know, we don’t—we don’t take anything for granted.  We, we don’t expect that things will deteriorate.  But, nonetheless, we have a habit of keeping things in place for a while.  So we’re not taking our gains in financial market function for granted, although, admittedly, they’ve been very large. So the asset purchases are just another very important piece of the accommodative policy stance that we have.  And, you know, as you know, these—we’re buying $120 billion a month.  That’s $1.44 trillion, if I remember my times tables.  And it’s just providing a lot of support for, for economic activity and, by the way, removing just about the same amount of duration risk from private hands as QE3 did.  So this is a big program, and it’s doing a lot of good.  And we also, today, you know, we had a full discussion of the options around quantitative ease—not quantitative easing, the asset purchase program, and, you know, we understand the, the ways in which we can adjust the parameters of it to deliver more accommodation if it turns out to be appropriate.  Right now, we think that this very large, effective program is delivering about the right amount of accommodation and support for the markets, and so it continues. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Craig Torres, Bloomberg. 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Hi, Chair Powell.  First, it’s great to see you’re okay.  Chair Powell, what is the risk that we come out of this with lower productivity; weaker labor force attachment;  November 5, 2020  slower growth; and, important for your tools, Chair Powell, a cycle of lower real interest rates?    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   And if you think this type of scarring is a risk, then I’m wondering, what’s stopping the Federal Reserve from having a more explicit dialogue with Congress about the particular types of fiscal support we might need to avoid this outcome to make sure that you push away from the zero boundary or that the economy does when we exit this?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  So you did—you laid out nicely the, the risks of damage to the supply side of the economy, or “scarring,” as you put it.  And we’ve been talking about those since the very beginning of the pandemic.  The risk is that, for example, people are out of the labor force for an extended period of time.  They lose their attachment to the labor force, and it’s harder to get back.  Your skills atrophy.  It’s harder to get back in.  And the record is, if you don’t get back in very fairly quickly, it can be harder to get back in.  And that holds down the whole economy.  And, by the way, it also—it places enormous burdens on individuals who may have this happen to them at an important stage in their career.  So it’s, it’s, it’s important. And, you know—so that is one of the reasons why our response was so strong and so urgent at the beginning and why we called this, this set of risks out.  I don’t know how we could be much more vocal about it than we have been.  Fortunately, for—you know, the economic recovery has exceeded, certainly, the downside cases that we were very concerned about and even, even exceeded—sort of exceeded the baseline expectations. Now, that’s so far.  We are a long way from our goals.  And, you know, we’re, we’re sort of halfway there on the labor market recovery at best.  And, and there are parts of the economy where it’s going to be hard until there’s a vaccine—you know, the parts of the economy.  So, you know, that’s the supply-side damage.  That’s sort of the third thing that we talk about.  The first, at the beginning, it was to provide relief and comfort.  The second—then the second part was to  November 5, 2020  provide support when—to the expansion when it came.  And the third was to avoid longer-run   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL damage to the economy, and that’s, that’s all of these things. I think we have been vocal.  You know, we’ll, we’ll try to continue to do that.  And, and those are—that’s again—that goes to keeping this episode as short as it can be and avoiding unnecessary business bankruptcies, unnecessary household bankruptcies, and unnecessary long-term stays of unemployment or supporting people through them so that they can maintain their financial footing and their lives and be able to go back to work in a productive way.  It’s, it’s very important that—you know, there is a real threat here of those things, and, and, you know, we’re trying to do everything we can to minimize that threat.

MICHELLE SMITH.  [Inaudible] 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  [Inaudible] —look like and whether you anticipate any consequences if they are not extended? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, thanks.  So, first, let me say, we do think that the facilities have, have generally served their purposes well, particularly in supporting the flow of credit, particularly acting as backstops to private markets.  So, overall, we think that the, the programs have, have gone well.  In terms of the extension, we are, we are just now turning to that question.  You know, we’ve had a lot of things to work our way through.  Right now we’re just in the process of turning to that question and, of course, not made any decisions.  And in terms of the process, this is a decision that, of course, we have to make and will make jointly with the Treasury Department. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  David Gura. 

[SECTION]

DAVID GURA.  [Inaudible]  IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath wrote—Gita Gopinath wrote a piece this week in which she said, unequivocally, we’re in a global liquidity trap and  November 5, 2020  talked about the limits of monetary policy right now.  She said, “Fiscal policy will need to be the   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   main game in town.”  And it’s been a busy week.  I don’t know if you were able to pick up the pink paper and read that piece, but she does say 97 percent of advanced economies have rates below 1 percent.  And I just wonder if you’d agree with her, in principle, that we are in a global liquidity trap, and what the consequences of that would be.  We’ve talked a lot about fiscal policy here domestically, and she talks about the need for sort of a global cohesive approach to, to fiscal policy.  My second question is, you talk about how you follow the epidemiology.  You’re, you’re looking [inaudible]. And I wanted to ask you about how you look at [inaudible] Christine Lagarde laying out what the ECB plans to do.  As you lent an ear to what she had to say, the dire warnings that she was making this morning as she looks at the situation that Europe’s in, what can you and your colleagues learn about the second wave or the third wave that you’ve talked about and, and we’ve all feared when it comes to a, a policy response? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Okay, thanks.  So two questions.  First, I, I take the sense of your first question to be, is monetary policy out of power or out of ammo?  And the answer to that would be “no,” I don’t think that.  I think—I think that we are strongly committed to using these powerful tools that we have to support the economy during this difficult time for as long as needed, and no one should have any doubt about that.  And we do not doubt the power of the things that we’ve already done or the things that we may, may do in the future.  I do think there’s more that can be done.  And I also think, if you look at the stock of assets that we’ve bought, if you look at the facilities and, and the way we’ve been able to keep accommodative financial—financial conditions accommodative, I think we’ve been able to do a lot of things that are  November 5, 2020  providing very strong support for the economy.  And we’re going to—we’re going to keep   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL at that. I’ve said—we’ve said from the very beginning, though, that this is particular—that the particular situation we find ourselves in is one where there is a sudden loss of income on, on the part of millions and tens of millions of people.  It’s not so much a typical recession where demand weakens, the Fed cuts interest rates, interest rates stimulate demand, and the economy recovers.  It’s a sudden shock where tens of millions of people are out of work.  And the fiscal response was, was frankly, I think, very good and very robust in the United States.  And it’s certainly one of the main reasons why the recovery has been as good as it’s been so far.  So I do think fiscal policy is absolutely essential here.  You know, stimulating aggregate demand is one thing, but where there’s a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that, you also need fiscal policy.  And, of course, you need health-care policy too. I didn’t see Madame Lagarde’s comments this morning, but I, I took the sense of that question to be the spread of the disease in Europe, and what do we think about that?  Yes.  So, as I mentioned in my—in my opening remarks, it’s a concern.  We have a widespread spike in cases across the country, more in some regions than others.  And even if we don’t have—and I don’t expect that we would—sort of government-imposed restrictions, it does seem likely, though, that people who have maybe begun to engage in activities that they had in flying, staying in a hotel, going to restaurants, going to bars, and, and things like that, that they may pull back in a situation where suddenly the cases are everywhere in your city, your state, your community.  So I do think that that’s a risk that we have as we go into the fall now and, and the cases spike.  That, that could weigh on economic activity.  One would expect that it would.  We thought the same thing, in fairness, about the wave we had this summer in the South and the West.  And the  November 5, 2020  economy, you know, seemed to move right through that.  This one seems to be larger and more   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   widespread.  In any case, it’s a risk, is what I would characterize it—I would characterize it as a risk, as I did in my—in my comments. 

[SECTION]

DAVID GURA.  Can I ask a quick follow-up, just about the passions of the Fed Chairman?  We’ve listened to your rhetoric over the course of this pandemic, and you talked about what the Fed was doing, the reasons for doing it at first.  You talked about the balance between monetary and fiscal policy.  I think in your recent comments and in Governor Brainard’s comments, certainly, there’s been more passion yet about the need for Congress to do more—I know that you’re limited in what you can say or the degree to which you’d want to advise Congress, but a simple question:  Do you feel that you’re being heard?  As you look at the prospects for this economy and potential need for more fiscal policy, do you feel like those who are crafting that policy, or could be, are listening to you and have a firm grasp of what you’re saying about how that might affect or improve the economy going forward? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So let me—let me say, in the first instance, our, our main focus is on doing our job, and that is really what we’re, we’re focused on is using the tools that Congress has given us and the assignment they’ve given us.  And I think we’re, we’re—that is the thing that we think about night and day.  I just know from, from the experience of the last cycle, it helps to have the whole government working on these things, and this one is particularly that way.  And I, I don’t—I think—you know, I, I don’t want to say whether I feel like I’m being heard or not.  But, sure, I think there are plenty of people on Capitol Hill who, on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Hill, who see a need for further fiscal action and understand perfectly why that might be the case.

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Edward Lawrence, Fox Business. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question.  So what would cause the Federal Reserve to shift more of its asset purchases towards the long-term securities and Treasuries and change the amount of spending there also?  And as a second point onto that, you know, would—if there’s no fiscal stimulus package, would that then trigger buying of more long-term assets or change the asset purchases? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I don’t really have a specific hypothetical I would—I would put to you.  I would just say that we, we understand that there are a number of parameters that we have where we can shift the composition, the duration, you know, the size, the life, life cycle of the program.  All of those things are, are available to us as ways to deliver addition—you know, more accommodation if we think that’s appropriate.  Right now, we, we like the amount of accommodation the program is, is delivering.  And it will just depend on the—on the facts and circumstances.  We may reach a view at some point that we need to do more on that front.  Today’s meeting was about analyzing the—one of the things it was about was about analyzing the various ways and having a, you know, good discussion about how to think about those, those various parameters, which I, I thought was quite a useful discussion. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Victoria Guida. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking the question.  I wanted to ask about climate change.  FHFA Director Mark Calabria recently said that financial regulators need to account for financial change—climate change, I’m sorry.  What are you all thinking of doing on that front beyond what you’re already doing, and do you have any plans for joining the network for greening the financial system?  November 5, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So I, I do think that the public, public will expect and has every right to expect that we—that in our oversight of the financial system, we will account for all material risks and try to protect the economy and the public from those risks.  Climate change is, is one of those risks.  It’s a relatively—the science and art of incorporating climate change into our thinking about financial regulation is relatively new, as you know.  And we are, you know, very actively, in the early stages of this, getting up to speed, working with our central bank colleagues and other colleagues around the world to try to think about how this can be part of our framework.  And we’re watching what other—what other countries are doing. We’re active participants, as you know, in the CG—no, the greening the financial system.  And, you know, we haven’t, we hadn’t actually formally joined, but we’re there.  We’re in the working groups, and we’re doing all of that.  So we’re very much working with and monitoring the things other central banks are doing.  You hear—you know, there’s lots of research going on at the various Reserve Banks and here at the Board in trying to understand this.  These tend to be longer-term risks.  But, of course, the longer term does arrive over time.  And, you know, we take it as our obligation to—you know, to understand these risks and incorporate them into our—into the way we supervise and, and think about the, the overall financial system and the economy. 

[SECTION]

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Quick follow-up from Gina’s question:  Have you gotten a commitment from Secretary Mnuchin to extend the 13(3) facilities if you decide it’s necessary, and are you concerned what a lame-duck Trump Administration might do in that regard?  And then, more broadly, on the state of the economy, are you comfortable now that the tail risk for worst-case outcomes has been kind of swept aside and minimized at this point?  Are we down, in  November 5, 2020  other words, to kind of household-level problems among a large set of households, perhaps, but   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   that the financial crisis, double-dip recession sort of scenarios are, are off the table? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, on your first question, we, we really are just turning to this issue now, and we have not made any decisions.  We, we are just getting started on it, and, and it’s a say today.  That’s all I have for you on that today. In terms of the tail risks, I mean, I think clearly the tail risks that we were worried about have, have subsided.  And, you know, we were worried about very negative potential outcomes.  And that—you know, that’s, that’s—what is to be expected of us is, is to think about how things can go wrong as well as the way things that can go right.  But we, we have to—we do make policy from a risk-management standpoint.  We don’t just look at the most likely case.  We, we ask, “How do you make policy in light of the risks?” and often it’s downside risks in a situation like this.  I would not say that anybody’s feeling comfortable about this, though.  You know, we’ve gotten through the first five, six months of the—of the expansion better than expected, but we do see in Europe—look what’s happening in Europe, look what’s happening here—another spike in cases as the cold weather arrives and people are inside more.  So I think we have to be humble about where we are relative to this—to this disease.  It hasn’t gone away.  Clearly, you know, therapeutics are advancing, research on vaccines are advancing, death rates are way down, hospitalization rates are, are lower now, but—so we’re learning.  But, I mean, we, we are so—we’re very far from saying that we think we’ve got this and eliminated the tail risks.  But I think, clearly, the tail risks have, have diminished since—at least our perception of them has diminished since earlier in the year.

So let me say why it’s such an important—you know, in a world where so many payments are made digitally and all that, coins and currency are very important for the relatively low-income people.  And so it’s a really incredibly important part of the payment system, and we do pay a lot of attention to it.  And I actually just—I just caught up this morning with the—with the person who heads that operation here who, who says that, yes, things have really gotten significantly better on the coin front.  So we worked very hard to increase the supply of coins and, even more than that, the distribution of coins around the System and are happy to say that that situation is well on the way to normalizing itself.  So very pleased to report that.

[SECTION]

JAMES POLITI.  Thanks very much for the—for the question, Chair Powell.  We’ve just had a presidential election here in the United States.  We still don’t know who the winner is.  Are you concerned that perhaps tensions or uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election could pose a risk to the economic outlook or trigger market turmoil?  And has the Fed had any discussions, either internally or with the Treasury Department, about responding to that, should it 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks.  So I’m very reluctant, as you will imagine, to comment on the election directly, indirectly, at all, other than just to say that it’s a good time to take a step back and let the institutions of our democracy do their jobs.  So, at the Fed here, we will, as happen?  November 5, 2020  always, continue to do our jobs.  Every day we’ll continue to serve the American people using   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL our tools to support the economy during this difficult time.  You know, the—you ask if we had discussions.  I would say, you know, the meeting we just finished, for example, what we do is we talk about the economy and markets, domestically and around the world.  We hear reports on how households and businesses are doing.  We talk about risks to the outlook.  We talk about what the right policy response might be.  And the election comes up in some—you know, it comes up now and again, but it is not at all a central focus of the meeting.  Not at all.  So I, I’ll just leave it at that.  Again, very reluctant to get into anything more than that.  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Anneken, CNN. 

[SECTION]

ANNEKEN TAPPE.  Thank you for taking my question.  Chairman Powell, can you tell us a little bit more about why the minimum loan size under the Main Street facility was reduced last week and why that was done now rather than earlier, seeing that small businesses are still—clearly still—struggling to make the change necessary? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So, we have had very little demand below $1 million in loans.  And part of that just is that the fee structure is what it is, and that’s the compensation that the banks get.  And there’s a certain amount of work that they have to do to get—to get into the loan program and do—and to document the thing, the loans that they make because these are loans that, you know, go on their balance sheet.  They keep 5 percent, so they actually have to underwrite the credit.  And we’re relying on them, to some extent, for, for doing that.  And so we were reluctant.  We moved the minimum down to $250,000, and we were reluctant to go below that.  But we heard, over and over again, that it would be great if we could reduce it to $100,000. So—and, you know, we’ve been saying we’d have to redesign the program.  And I, I got the question in a—in an oversight hearing a month or so ago with the Secretary and said that.   November 5, 2020  And I went back to the office and thought, you know, okay, so what would that look like if we   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL were to redesign the program in a way—what’s the least thing we could do to redesign the program so that we could move to a lower level?  And it—basically, we concluded we could just change the fee structure to create incentives for that, so we did that.  We try to be responsive.  We want, you know, qualifying businesses to be able to borrow.  And we’ll see how much demand will come. You know, with, with these programs, why did it—why didn’t we do it right away?  We tend to—it’s—there’s more work than one might—certainly than I imagined in setting up one of these facilities.  And you, you just try to get it out there and get it working and not try to do everything before you start it because you’ll never start it if you do that.  Then you get it started, and you make changes.  And we’ve been willing to make changes.  That’s the most recent set of ones that we’ve done.  And, again, we hope—we hope that it will help some companies, and I guess we’ll find out. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Heather. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER SCOTT.  Heather Scott this time, right?  Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking the question.  You say that you’re—that you’re not out of ammo.  So I’m wondering, then, what is the next tool you expect to be able to roll out?  Would you consider some sort of credit program for state and local businesses—state and local governments that are facing real budgetary pressures? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So when I say we’re not out of ammo, I’m looking at, you know, a couple of our tools, mainly.  As I mentioned, the asset purchase program—there’s a number of dimensions in which we can adjust that if we deem it to be appropriate.  Right now, we like the job it’s doing.  We could, you know, if, if the facilities are extended, we could certainly look at  November 5, 2020  new facilities.  If—you know, if things deteriorate, that would be the case where you’d want to   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL knows?  But, certainly, the facilities have been doing a lot of work and been very successful, I think, overall in accomplishing that job.  So I do think there, there are things that we can do.  But, remember, we’ve always said this will take a whole of government approach, including health-care policy and fiscal policy too.  So it really is, if you—if you want to get the economy back as quickly as possible to where we want it to be, then, then really it should be all of government working together. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER SCOTT.  If I could just follow up on that quickly.  I mean, you spoke [inaudible] about the small business lending program.  But that has only reached 400—there’s only been 400 loans.  When you say the programs are effective, do you not think there’s more that can be done with another type of program or another redesign either for small businesses or for assisting state and local governments? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  There’s a bunch of programs.  I would say that the, you know, the corporate—the larger corporate market-based lending program has been very successful without making a single loan—I think, unambiguously, has been a big success.  I think the success—I think the state and local government program has also restored market function so that—whereas, you know, there were the, the sort of individual investors who wind up funding loans in the muni market through. through mutual funds, they, they had withdrawn a lot of money, and, and that—we’ve had many weeks of consecutive, I believe, of, of inflows there, and you’re largely back to a normal functioning market.  I think that’s also been a success.  I think the other—certainly the, the funding market programs have been a big success.  November 5, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL The—Main Street is just—is just a bigger challenge than all of them.  Reaching out to small and medium-sized businesses through the banking system, which we had to do, is, is quite challenging.  I do think, you know, the grant programs, the PPP, were, were a great way to reach smaller companies.  You know, what you hear out there is that demand—you talk to banks, and they’ll say demand for loans is very, very low right now.  Companies are not borrowing.  And, and the reason is that, you know, activity’s at a relatively low level.  They don’t want to run up their debt.  You know, so I—we put, we put an awful lot into Main Street, and it is very challenging to reach a lot of those companies.  But I—you know, I think we, we are reaching many of them now, and, and I hope that the new changes will help us reach more. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Last question to Michael McKee, Bloomberg. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, there’s a small but growing number of people, including some former Fed economists, who say you should find ways to go beyond your mandate to provide additional support to the economy, which, in essence, would be fiscal support, since it hasn’t come from Congress.  One of the suggestions is buying state and municipal securities directly.  Another is perhaps following the BOE in increasing asset purchases to support additional fiscal programs or spending by the Treasury.  Is there any circumstance under which you would consider those or those would be justified?  How closely are you willing to work with Treasury? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so I’m going to take your question literally.  And so if the idea is money-financed fiscal policy, that’s not something that we would consider.  So that—what I mean by that is, is really, you know, the, the central bank is really funding fiscal activities of the government fairly directly.  No, that’s not something we do.  We have different jobs.  That  November 5, 2020  know, the job of taxation and spending goes to people who have stood for election and been   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL elected, and that’s the way it should be.  There—they have to be responsible to the electorate. We have a specific, you know, job to do with, with a specific set of tools to support maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability, help the payment system, supervise banks—all the things we’re assigned to do.  But we, we, we’re not going to get into financing the government and, and—by the way, when we buy government bonds, we don’t—it doesn’t actually, as you probably know, doesn’t change the amount of government debt outstanding.  We issue a reserve to, to purchase a Treasury security, and that’s just another form—on the consolidated balance sheet of the federal government, that’s just another obligation.  You change the—you change the, you know, the nature of the obligation, but not the total quantity of debt that the government has when you do these asset purchase programs.  So I don’t know exactly what you’re referring to.  But, you know, to—again, to take your question literally about financing fiscal activity, it’s really not something that we think the central bank should do and, and not something we’re looking at. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  If I could follow up, there is a suggestion that you buy state and municipal securities directly in the same way that you buy mortgage-backed securities, providing, then, cash to municipalities that are cash-strapped at this point. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, we’re doing that with the Municipal Liquidity Facility now, so we’re, we’re buying, you know, with, with our own funds and with the CARES Act funds that, that we’ve gotten through Congress and the Treasury.  We’re buying municipal securities of up to three years.  So we’re doing that now as part of an emergency facility under section 13(3), you know, which has to meet the emergency requirements of exigent circumstances and which is all clearly laid out in the law.  So we’re, we’re actually doing that now.  November 5, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL But I, I see—what that is, from our standpoint, is a rare thing that we do under section 13(3) when regular intermediation in the capital markets or in the banking system has broken down.  It’s no longer working.  So we step in under 13(3), and we provide liquidity.  What turns out to happen is, we announce a program, and the market starts working.  So we only actually have to do a backstop.  The amount of financing that’s happened in the municipal markets this year is much higher than it was the prior year, and, and we didn’t do it.  We did—we’ve done a very small number of, of loans.  But just the fact that we’re there as a backstop seems to—seems to get the private parties to get back together and, and get the market working again.  So that’s what 13(3) is for. We’re not—that shouldn’t be a permanent thing where we’re just another federal financing agency that’s available to direct credit to—you know, to very worthy borrowers.  That would be more along the lines of a GSE.  That’s not what we do.  We’re there to provide emergency liquidity when intermediation has broken down and then to pull back on that when—you know, when—as the markets normalize, we pull back and we put those tools away, as we did after the Global Financial Crisis and as we will here when the time comes.

CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.   ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
40,2020-12-16,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us—maximum employment and price stability.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.  Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I reaffirmed our strong forward guidance for interest rates and also provided additional guidance for our asset purchases.  Together, these measures will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete. Economic activity has continued to recover from its depressed second-quarter level.  The substantial reopening of the economy led to a rapid rebound in activity, and real GDP rose at an annual rate of 33 percent in the third quarter.  In recent months, however, the pace of improvement has moderated.  Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been strong and has moved above its pre-pandemic level.  In contrast, spending on services remains low, especially in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality.  The overall rebound in household spending owes in part to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many families and individuals.  The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates.  Business investment has also picked up.  The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our September Summary of Economic Projections.  Even so, overall economic activity remains well below its level before the pandemic, and the path ahead remains highly uncertain.  December 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL In the labor market, more than half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated.  Job growth slowed to 245,000 in November, and while the unemployment rate has continued to decline, it remains elevated at 6.7 percent.  Participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemic levels.  Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, we will not lose sight of the millions of Americans who remain out of work.  Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 5 percent at the end of next year and moves below 4 percent by 2023.  The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit.  In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics.  The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.  Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer but have leveled out more recently.  For those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft.  Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective.  The median inflation projection from FOMC participants rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.8 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2023. As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on the course of the virus.  Recent news on vaccines has been very positive.  However, significant challenges and uncertainties remain with regard to the timing, production, and distribution of vaccines as well as their efficacy across  December 16, 2020  different groups.  It remains difficult to assess the timing and scope of the economic implications   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   of these developments.  The ongoing surge in new COVID-19 cases, both here in the United States and abroad, is particularly concerning, and the next few months are likely to be very challenging.  All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic.  Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength.  A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to engage—reengage in a broad range of activities.  As we previously announced, we are now releasing the entire package of our SEP materials at the same time as our FOMC statement.  Included in these materials are two new exhibits that show how the balance of participants’ assessments of uncertainty and risks have evolved over time.  Since the onset of the pandemic, nearly all participants continue to judge the level of uncertainty about the economic outlook as elevated.  In terms of risks to the outlook, fewer participants see the balance of risks as weighted to the downside than in September.  While a little more than half of participants now judge risks to be broadly balanced for economic activity, a similar number continue to see risks weighted to the downside for inflation. The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  As noted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal.  Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.  As we reiterated in today’s statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and  December 16, 2020  longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.  We expect to maintain an   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.  With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, as we noted in today’s policy statement, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  We believe the increase in our balance sheet this year has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy. Combined with our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, our enhanced balance sheet guidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses.  Our guidance is outcome based and is tied to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals.  Thus, if progress toward our goals were to slow, the guidance would convey our intention to increase policy accommodation through a lower expected path of the federal funds rate and a higher expected path of the balance sheet.  Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so.  The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local governments.  Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating damage to  December 16, 2020  the economy and promoting a robust recovery.  Many of our programs rely on emergency   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL lending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today.  These programs serve as a backstop to key credit markets and have helped to restore the flow of credit from private lenders through normal channels.  We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury.  Although funds from the CARES Act will not be available to support new loans or new purchases after—of assets after December 31, the Treasury could authorize support for emerging lending facilities, if needed, through the Exchange Stabilization Fund.  When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the box. As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers.  The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.  We can only create programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid.  Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy.  But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer.  In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.  Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources.  The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country.  Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe of our lifetimes.  It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.  December 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Rich Miller. 

[SECTION]

RICH MILLER.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you, Michelle.  I wonder if I could start with the, the SEP.  We have—unemployment now is at 6.7, the SEP median sees, sees it falling to 5.  Headline inflation is one time 1.2, the SEP median sees it rising to 1.8.  And core inflation is 1.4, and the SEP sees it rising to 1.8 likewise.  Would that constitute “substantial further progress” toward the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  Well, so we’re not—we’re not going to be identifying specific—associating that test with, with specific numbers at this point.  So, really, the question is, what do we mean by, by that language?  And, really, the overarching message, Rich, is that our guidance for both interest rates and asset purchases will keep monetary policy accommodative until our maximum-employment and price-stability goals are achieved, and that’s, that’s a powerful message.  So “substantial further progress” means what it says.  It means we’ll be looking for employment to be substantially closer to assessments of its maximum level and inflation to be substantially closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal before we start making adjustments to our purchases. I would also point out that by increasing our asset holdings, we see ourselves as adding policy accommodation.  There will come a time when the economy does not require increasing amounts of policy accommodation.  And when that time comes—and that will be uncertain and, in any case, is, is some ways off.  So I can’t give you an exact set of numbers.  We will—of  December 16, 2020  course, as we approach that point, we’ll be evaluating that.  And when we see ourselves on a   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL path to achieve that goal, then we will—we will say so undoubtedly well in advance of any time when we would actually consider gradually tapering the pace of purchases. 

[SECTION]

RICH MILLER.  Very quickly on, on that.  You, you mentioned the next couple months are going to be very challenging.  And regarding asset purchases, why not increase the duration of the asset purchases at this time, given what you see as a very challenging period ahead? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, again, I would start with what we actually did at the meeting, which, which was, we provided this, this guidance about the path of asset purchases.  And I just went through what, what they—what they—the guidance that we put forward.  And, you know, so I guess since September we’ve now adopted a flexible average inflation-targeting framework.  We have provided rate guidance that is tightly linked to the goals as expressed in that new framework.  And now we’ve done the same for, for asset purchases.  So, you know, we’ve, we’ve been sort of—as, as the future has become clearer and as we’ve absorbed new developments in medical—in the medical sphere and also in, in the economy, we have—began to be able to see further.  So we’ve, we’ve started to be able to provide further important guidance.  And we think that the—that the asset purchase guidance, guidance is very important.  We think that the, the prior language of “in coming months” was obviously temporary.  This links that guidance, those purchases, to actual “substantial further progress” toward our, our mandated goals.  We think that’s important.  And we think that that is important to have done. I, I would just add, though, that we also continue to think that our current policy stance is appropriate.  We think it’s providing a great deal of support for the economy.  Financial conditions are highly accommodative.  And, you know, we monitor a range of financial condition indexes.  There are many of them, and they’ll, they’ll all pretty much tell you that.   December 16, 2020  You can—you can also look at the interest sensitive parts of the economy—for example,   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL housing, durable sales, vehicle sales—those parts of the economy are, are performing very, very well.  The parts of the economy that are weak are the service-sector businesses that involve close contact.  Those are not being held back by financial conditions, but rather by the spread of the virus. And I’ll close by, by just saying, we do have the flexibility to provide more accommodation through the channel you mentioned and through other channels.  And we recognize that circumstances could shift in a way that warrants our, our doing that, including by adjusting purchases.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the U.S. economy to achieve our goals.  We will continue to use our tools to support the economy for as long as it takes until the job is well and truly done.  No one should doubt that.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, a two-part question.  What, if anything, would prompt the Fed to shift Treasury purchases toward the longer end of the curve as you did with your prior QE programs?  And does your guidance today on asset purchases foreclose the possibility that you could, at some point, lengthen maturities while simultaneously tapering the monthly purchase amounts? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, Nick, I—on, on the first part of the question, I, I don’t—I wouldn’t want to sort of talk about hypothetical situations.  You know, we, we look at our overall stance of policy, we look at overall financial conditions, we look at what’s going on in the economy—different parts of the economy, and we ask ourselves, should we change our policy stance?  We do that at every meeting.  And we look at where financial conditions are now,  December 16, 2020  and, and we, we feel that they are appropriate for now.  Anytime we feel like the economy could,   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   could use stronger accommodation, we would be prepared to provide it.  We—but right now, we’re providing a great deal, and we think—we happen to think it’s the right amount. And, you know, you, you mentioned—I think you’re referring to the idea of maintaining the duration but, but reducing the quantity, which is sort of what the Bank of Canada did.  And that, that is something that we—you know, that we talked about in the last meeting and was addressed in the minutes.  And I would say, the views on that were mixed:  Some thought it was an interesting idea, others not so much.  I, I wouldn’t say that that’s something that’s, that’s high on our list of, of possibilities.

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.  I wanted to ask about the 13(3) facilities.  Chair Powell, you’ve said that you accept Treasury Secretary Mnuchin’s interpretation of the statute of the CARES Act on, on what should happen with those programs.  So, first of all, I’m curious whether under a new Treasury Secretary you will accept whatever legal interpretation they put forward for those programs.  And then, also, given that there isn’t a statutory requirement for you to have financial backing from Treasury for 13(3) facilities, do you have any plans for any future facilities that don’t require Treasury backing? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So on your—on your first question, we really have not thought about that.  We’re, we’re very focused on—we have a lot to do now.  We, we have not focused on, on that question, and I, I really have nothing to add on that.  Your second question is—sorry.  Oh, if there were no—yes.  No, we, we would have the ability—certainly, we would have the ability to do facilities under 13(3) in some cases with no backing.  But we can’t do any 13(3) facilities  December 16, 2020  without the approval of the Treasury Secretary, right?  But we did some facilities—I think one of   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   our facilities this time didn’t have any Treasury backing.  And I think some in the—in the round of—during the Global Financial Crisis also didn’t have any. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  So do you have any plans—like, would you consider doing more facilities if that became necessary without Treasury backing? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I would say that we are—you know, we’re—we have the authorities we have.  We will use them if, if they’re needed and if—and if the law permits us to do so.  We would—we would always do that.  We, we do not have any plans for, for the future about this.  We—we’re very focused on, on getting through year-end.  We’ve been very focused on, on the issues that are right in front of us.  And, honestly, we’re not—we’re not planning on anything or having any discussions about what we might do down the road.

There’s talk right now of a $900 billion fiscal stimulus program in Congress.  Is, is that sufficient?  Is that what you’re looking for?  Do you think that’ll be sufficient for helping the economy?  Finally, you talked about the idea of how concerning the recent surge is.  I wonder if you can put some detail on that.  How much concern do you have in terms of, where could employment go?  What could happen to GDP in the first quarter as a result of this surge?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  So on, on fiscal policy, I would just say a couple of things.  The case for fiscal policy right now is, is very, very strong.  And I think that is widely understood, I would say, now.  The details of it are entirely up to Congress.  But with the  December 16, 2020  expiration of unemployment benefits—some of the unemployment benefits, the expiration of   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL eviction moratoriums with the virus spreading the way it is, there’s a need for households and businesses to have, have fiscal support.  And I do think that—again, I think that is widely understood.  So I think it would be—I, I certainly would welcome the work that Congress is doing right now.  It’s not up to us to judge that work.  It’s really, really theirs.  And I, I don’t have a view for you on, on the size of it.  It’s—you know, it’s obviously a substantial bill. On the surge, you know, so it’s a really interesting question.  We have, and others too, have consistently expected there to be more economic—that, that cases would hold—growth in cases would hold back the economy more than it actually has.  So we’ve overestimated the, the effects on the economy of, of these spikes we’ve been having. Now, this spike is so much larger that I think—and I think forecasters generally do think that there—that this will have an effect on suppressing activity, particularly activity that involves people getting together in bars and restaurants, on airplanes and hotels and things like that.  And you’re starting to see that.  In the—in the high-frequency data, you’re now beginning to see that show up.  And I think if this is—the case numbers are so high and so widespread across the country that that, that seems like it must happen. Now, how big will it be?  We don’t—we don’t really know.  You know, there are—there are a lot of estimates.  The general expectation is, you’re seeing some slowing now.  And you’ll see the first quarter could well be—what, what we said is that coming months are going to be challenging.  The first quarter will, will certainly show significant effects from this. At the same time, people are getting vaccinated now.  They’re getting vaccinated.  And by the end of the first quarter into the second quarter, you’re going to be seeing significant numbers of people vaccinated.  And so then what will be—how will that play into economic  December 16, 2020  activity?  Again, we don’t have any experience with this.  You have to think that sometime in the   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   middle of next year, you will—you will see people feeling comfortable going out and engaging in a broader range of activities.  And some people will be probably quick to do that.  Some are doing it now without a vaccine—right?—in many parts of the country. So, nonetheless, my expectation—and I think many people have the expectation that the second half of next year should—the economy should be performing strongly.  We should be—you know, we should be getting people back to work.  Businesses should be reopening and that kind of thing.  The issue is more the next four or five months—getting through the next four, five, six months.  That is key.  And, and, you know, clearly there’s going to be need for help there.  And, and, you know, my sense and hope is that we’ll be getting that.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Jeanna Smialek. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you for taking our questions.  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about house prices.  They were mentioned in the most recent minutes as, you know, potentially a valuation concern, especially as it related to your mortgage-backed security purchases.  And you mentioned earlier today that the housing market looks more or less fully healed.  And so I guess I wonder, are you worried about valuation pressures there?  And, if so, what can the Fed do to contain those? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so we monitor basically just about every asset price in the economy, and housing prices are something that we’ve been monitoring.  And you see them moving up.  You see very high demand.  This, this is the housing market that people have been expecting since, you know, 2010.  And, and then, you know, not many, when the—when the pandemic hit, thought, “Oh, this is what—this is what will produce that housing market,” but it has.  December 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL Now, I would say, from a financial stability standpoint, housing prices are not—are not of a level of concern right now.  That’s just reflective of a lot of demand.  And, you know, builders are going to bring forth supply.  There’s also a sense that this—some of this may be pent-up demand from when the economy was closed, which would imply that demand—once that demand is met, that the real level of demand will be more manageable. So it’s a—it’s a healthy economy now.  We, we met recently with a bunch of homebuilders, and many of them in the business 30, 40 years said they’ve never seen the likes of it.  But, no, housing prices themselves are not—are not a financial stability concern at the moment.  We will watch that carefully.  But in the near term, I wouldn’t think that that’s an issue that we’d be concerned about. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Edward Lawrence. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman.  So with the actions that you’ve currently taken, how do you—how do you further fight a slowdown that you’re seeing?  We’ve talked about the retail sales numbers are a little bit sluggish this month, the unemployment, the job growth has slowed down.  Is there more the Fed can do to fight this?  Or is it now squarely in the Congress’s realm? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  There is more that we can do, certainly.  We can—we can expand our, our asset purchase programs.  We can focus them more on the longer end.  There are a number of options we would have to provide more support to the economy. So I would—I would say, though, that in the near term, the help that people need isn’t just from low interest rates that stimulates demand over time and works with long and variable lags.  It’s really support.  As the—as—we’ve, we’ve talked about this as all of these government  December 16, 2020  policies trying to work together to create a bridge across this chasm, economic chasm that was   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL created by the pandemic.  And for many Americans, that bridge is there and, and they’re across it. But there’s a group for, for which they, they don’t have a bridge yet.  And that’s who we’re talking about here.  It’s, it’s the 10 million people who lost their jobs.  It’s people who may lose their homes.  It’s—you know, you see the, the—many, many millions of Americans are, are waiting in food lines in their cars these days all over the country.  So we know there’s need out there.  We know there are small businesses all over the country that, that have been basically unable to really function, and they’re just hanging on.  So—and, and they’re, they’re so critical to our economy.  So—and, by the way, now that we can—we can kind of see the light at the end of the tunnel, it would be—it would be bad to see, you know, people losing their business, their life’s work in many cases, or even generations’ worth of work, because they couldn’t last another few months, which is what it amounts to. So we have more we can do.  And we’ll—I, I think more the issue is, we’re going to need to continue to provide support to this economy for quite a period of time, because the, the economy will be growing in expectation.  We should be growing at a fairly healthy clip by the second half of next year.  But it’s going to be a while before we really are back to the levels of, of labor market—the, the sort of conditions in the labor market that we had in early this year and for much of the last couple of years.  So that’s how I think about it.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Howard Schneider.  December 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for doing this.  And thanks, Michelle.  Two, two quick questions.  One, on the vaccine, do you have, or has the Fed modeled, sort of a working estimate of when the U.S. might reach something approaching herd immunity? And, secondly, if you could, please connect with me the lack of movement on the are showing three years with inflation not reaching 2 percent.  Some might argue that you need to do more to start fixing those expectations, and to let this drift and say “We’re going to miss our target for another three years” doesn’t show a very firm commitment to the new framework. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, in terms of the vaccine, yes, you know, we do estimates of, of when the United States would reach herd immunity, and they’re, they’re going to be similar to what other people think.  You know, it depends on your assumptions, such as how many people will actually take the vaccine and how fast will the rollout be.  So it’s assumption based on assumption based on assumption.  But, you know, sometime—it’s possible sometime in the middle or second half of next year.  I’m not going to try to be precise, because it’s just another estimate.  You know, our people are very good, but they’re looking at, at the same data as other people are.  And so, you know, all the estimates are—it depends on what your assumptions are.  But under a normal set of assumptions, it could happen as, as soon as the middle of next year. In terms of the, you know, inflation, a couple things—your second question.  You know, we’re—I think you have to be honest with yourself about, about inflation these days.  There are—there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world, and there have been for a while, and they persist today.  It’s, is not going to be easy to have inflation move up.  And it isn’t going to be just a question—it’s going to take some time.  It took a long time to get inflation back to 2 percent in the last crisis.  December 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL And, you know, we’re, we’re honest with ourselves and with you in the SEP that even with the very high level of accommodation that we’re providing both through low rates and very high levels of asset purchases, it will take some time, because that’s what we believe the underlying inflation dynamics are in our economy.  And that’s sort of why we’re—one reason why we’re concerned about inflation is that we see that.  And, and that’s why we have adopted the flexible average inflation-targeting framework.  That’s why we’re aiming for an overshoot.  But we’re, we’re honest with ourselves and with the public that it will take some time to get there. In terms of, you know, would, would it really speed it up a lot to, to move asset purchases, you know, I don’t think that would really be—I think it’s going to take a long time however you do it.  And, you know, we’ve been having very long expansions since—in, in the last several decades because inflation has not—really, the old model was, inflation would come along and the Fed would tighten, and we’d have a recession. Now inflation has been low, and we haven’t had that dynamic.  And the result has been three of the four longest expansions in, in modern history, in recorded history.  So, you know, we’re, we’re thinking that this could be another long expansion, and that we’ll keep our—what we’re saying is, we’re going to keep policy highly accommodative until the expansion is well down the tracks.  And we’re not going to preemptively raise rates until we see inflation actually reaching 2 percent and being on track to exceed 2 percent.  That’s a very strong commitment, and we think that’s the right place to be. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber.  I’m sorry, Mr. Chair.  December 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I’m just going to add, markets have actually found this fairly credible.  If you look at what—at inflation compensation and at the survey measures of, of when the Fed will lift off, everything has moved.  There have been significant movements since we announced the framework in the direction that is consistent with the—with the framework being credible to market participants.  So I, I don’t think it’s something that—I, I mean, I’m actually pleased by, by the reception it’s gotten in markets.  And markets have moved in ways that suggest it is credible. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Chris. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi, thank you.  Yesterday, I guess, the Fed said that it is joining the international financial greening group.  And I just wanted to see if you could expand on how the Fed is thinking about climate change and how it might affect Fed policy going forward.  Specifically, I think Janet Yellen drew a distinction between considering climate change when it comes to financial regulation.  But how do you see that also potentially affecting monetary policy?  Obviously, there have been criticisms of the Fed for buying bonds of oil and gas companies.  But leaving that specific case aside, I mean, are there—is there any way that climate change considerations could affect monetary policy going forward? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So the—you’re, you’re talking about the—sorry, the Network [of Central Banks and Supervisors] for Greening the Financial System, which we joined this week.  And I’ll just—I’ll just say a couple things about that.  So, first, I’ll just start by saying that we’re going to move carefully and thoughtfully on developing an understanding of how climate change affects our work, including the areas you mentioned.  We’re going to do so with a great deal of engagement with all of our external constituencies, including the public and their elected representatives who are charged with our oversight.  We’ll do it with great transparency.  December 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL Remember that we are a nonpolitical agency whose goals and authorities to achieve those goals are set by Congress.  We have great responsibilities and strong authorities that we’ll use vigorously.  We’re not the forum where all the great issues of the day are to be hashed out, debated, and addressed unless and only to the extent that those issues are directly relevant to our statutory goals and are addressable through our legal authorities.  And because we have a narrow remit, and because we stick to it, Congress has given us a precious grant of independence from direct political control.  So society’s broad response to climate change is for others to decide—in particular, elected leaders. But—so let me—let me get to your question.  What does all that mean for an issue like climate change?  And why did we join the NGFS?  So Congress hasn’t explicitly assigned us or other financial regulators a role, and we’re not among the agencies who contribute to the National Climate Assessment—Climate Assessment, for example.  But climate change is nonetheless relevant to our existing mandates under the law.  And let me tell you why. One of our jobs is to regulate and supervise banks and to look after the stability of the financial system.  That’s a responsibility we share with other agencies.  The public will expect that we will—we will do that.  So we’ll, we’ll expect that, that those important institutions will be resilient against the many resists—risks that they fake—face:  credit risk, market risk, cyber risk.  Climate change is an emerging risk to financial institutions, the financial system, and the economy.  And we are, as so many others are, in the very early stages of understanding what that means, what needs to be done about it, and by whom.  That’s why 83 central banks have joined together to share research and identify best practices in this important emerging area.  We’ve been attending NGFS meetings as an observer for more than a year, taking part in the work.  We had discussed that it was probably time to join as a member.  December 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL I’ll just say that the financial system is really a global one.  It’s important that we work and discuss best practices with peer agencies around the world, especially in a field where we’re just beginning to develop our, our understanding. You asked about monetary policy.  You know, I—I’ll say this.  We, we have historically shied away strongly from taking a role in credit allocation.  In fact, our agreement with Treasury during the financial crisis from back in 2009 or ’10 says that we will avoid credit allocation.  It’s something we’ve carefully avoided.  So I, I would be very reluctant to see us move in that direction, picking one area as creditworthy and another not. So you asked about monetary policy.  You know, it’s, it’s—for now, I would say the real—the real concern is—the real place to focus, for me, is supervision of financial institutions and then financial stability concerns.  You can see a connection there.  Monetary policy, maximum employment, stable prices—it’s less obvious to me.  I can—I can, you know—I can make the argument, but it’s less obvious to me that those should be first-order things that we would look at in connection with climate change.  But I think there’s—I think there’s work to be done to understand the connection between climate change and the strength and resilience of financial markets and financial institutions.  I think that work is in its early days.  And, again, we’ll be careful.  We’ll be thorough and transparent and, and engage with the public on all that. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Rachel Siegel. 

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks very much for taking my question.  And thank you, Michelle.  I wanted to ask specifically about state and local aid.  Just as one example, the governor of Illinois announced roughly $700 million in early anticipated budget cuts to close the budget deficit, and the latest bipartisan stimulus proposal that’s being debated this week  December 16, 2020  seems to be leaving out state and local aid at this point.  And I’m just curious if you can give   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL some detail about the damage that these budget deficits or the lack of aid specifically to state and local governments will have on the recovery and, specifically, with the municipal lending facility set to expire, what more the Fed might be able to do to fill that specific hole.  Thanks very much. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  So the state and local governments, they provide important critical services:  safety, fire, police, health, all kinds of things like that.  They’re, they’re really involved in people’s lives, state and local governments are, to, to a large extent.  The decision whether to, to provide more fiscal support to them is entirely in the hands of Congress.  And, you know, they’re in the middle of these discussions, and, and those, those are issues for them to I would say that the picture is mixed.  What’s happened is, if you’re a state that has a significant exposure to tourism or to extracting energy from the ground—oil from the ground, or gas—you are probably, at least in those industries, feeling a significant loss of revenue.  A number of other states have been surprised on the upside, where—and that’s because goods sales, for example—property taxes are—don’t move much year to year.  And, you know, the kind of sales taxes on goods—goods sales have been very high.  Income has been more or less replaced by, by the CARES Act—fully replaced, more than, in many cases.  So the concerns that we had at the very beginning of really serious, deep shortfalls and massive budget cuts on the part of state and local governments have not yet—have not yet occurred.  What we’re seeing is, is that it’s different state to state.  And some states are having significant difficulties, others not The real concern, though, that still emerges is, state and local governments are very large employers, and—one of the largest.  And so far, since the pandemic began, employment has so much.  December 16, 2020  dropped by 1.3 million in—of state and local government.  So it’s, it’s a very large number of   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL people to be—to be out of work from just that one source.  It’s actually significantly more than lost their jobs during the Global Financial Crisis. So that is—that is a significant—a significant part of that group is, is in education.  So when the schools reopen, a significant part of that 1.3 million would go back to work.  Nonetheless, it’s a concern.  We’re, we’re watching carefully to understand why that—why that many people have been let go and what are—really are the sources.  So we’re monitoring it carefully, and it’s a mixed picture.  And I, I just have to leave the question of what to do with fiscal policy on this to Congress. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  James Politi. 

[SECTION]

JAMES POLITI.  Thank you, Michelle.  And thank you, Chair Powell.  You and the Fed have consistently said that the Fed is ready to provide the economy with more monetary support if needed and really stressed to policymakers generally that the dangers of not doing enough outweigh the risks of doing too much in a situation where there’s so much suffering in the economy.  The guidance today sort of cements asset purchases for a longer period of time but is not a big new easing step.  Why was now, with the short-term outlook deteriorating due to the new coronavirus surges, not the moment for a big new easing step?  And is it because of the medium-term outlook improving?  Or is it because the Fed just doesn’t have the capacity to sort of build that bridge over the next four to five months for the—for the people who are struggling? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So I, I could go back, James, to what I said earlier, which is, this is—this is a very, very large asset purchase program.  It’s providing a tremendous amount of, of support for the economy.  If you look at the interest-sensitive parts of the economy, they’re performing very well.  The parts that are not performing well are not struggling from high  December 16, 2020  interest rates.  They’re struggling from exposure to, to COVID, in a sense.  These are—these are   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   the businesses that, that are really hit hard by people’s reluctance to gather closely. So, so we, we do have the ability to—you know, to buy more bonds or to buy longer-term bonds.  And, and we may—we may use it.  I’m not saying we won’t—we won’t use that.  It may well come to, to using that.  But also, I would remind—I would also note, though, monetary policy works with “long and variable lags,” is the famous statement.  So we think that the big effects from monetary policy are, you know, months and months into the future.  So this looks like a—you know, it looks like a time when what is really needed is fiscal policy.  And, and that’s why it is, is a very positive thing that, that we’re getting that. So we, we remain open to doing—you know, to, to either increasing the size of our asset purchases, if that turns out to be appropriate, or to just moving the maturities, moving to buying longer maturities, because that had—that also increases accommodation by taking more duration risk out of the market.  But we think our current stance is appropriate.  And we think that our—you know, that our, our guidance on asset purchases today will also provide support to the economy over time.  Again, what we’ve—what we’ve done is, we’ve laid out a path whereby we’re going to keep monetary policy highly accommodative for a long time, really until—really until we reach very close to our goals, which is not, you know, not really the way it’s been done in the past.  So that’s, that’s providing significant support for the economy now. We don’t think the economy suffers from a lack of, of highly accommodative financial conditions.  We think it’s suffering from the pandemic and people wanting to not engage in certain kinds of economic activity.  And we expect that, that with the virus, that that will improve—that condition will improve.  Nonetheless, again, we will—are prepared to use our  December 16, 2020  tools, and we will use them at such time and in such amounts as we—as we think would,   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL would help. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Scott Horsley, NPR. 

[SECTION]

SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Some forecasters have suggested that there is a lot of pent-up demand for travel and entertainment and, and services and the like that might stop being pent up in a hurry if we do get to a point where the vaccine is widely distributed, and that the beaten-down service sector might have trouble meeting that demand in, in a hurry.  How might that affect inflation, in your mind?  And would that be just a transient problem or, or something that might warrant closer scrutiny? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So that, that has all the markings of a transient increase in the price level.  So you can imagine that as people really want to travel again—let’s say, you know, that airfare, airfares—I’m just imagining this, right?—that they go up.  But what inflation is, is a process whereby they go up year upon year upon year upon year.  And if—given the inflation dynamics that we’ve had over the last several decades, just a single, single sort of price-level increase has not resulted in ongoing price-level increases. And that, that was—the problem back in the 1970s was, it was the combination of two things.  One, when unemployment went down and resources got tight, prices started going up.  But the second problem was that that—that that increase was persistent, there was a level of persistence.  So if prices went up 6 percent this year, they’d go up 6 percent next year, because people would internalize.  I mean, really, really, that’s what happens is, people internalize that they can raise prices, and that it’s okay to pay prices that are going up at that rate.  So that was the inflation—those are the inflation dynamics of that era.  December 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL Those dynamics are not in place anymore.  There—the connection between low unemployment or other resource utilization and inflation is so much weaker than it was.  It’s still there, but it’s a—it’s a faint heartbeat compared to what it was.  And the persistence of inflation, if you—if you get a—for example, oil prices go up, and that’ll send a temporary shock through the economy.  The persistence of that into, into inflation over time is just not there.  So they—what you describe may happen, and, of course, we would watch it very carefully.  We, we understand that we will always be learning new things from the economy about how it will behave in certain cases.  But I would—I would expect, though, going in that that would be a one-time price increase rather than an increase in underlying inflation that would be persistent. 

[SECTION]

SCOTT HORSLEY.  So not the kind of thing that the Fed would, would be trigger-happy to, to— 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  No. 

[SECTION]

SCOTT HORSLEY.  —respond to? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  No, no.  Definitely not. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Michael Derby. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  [Inaudible]—question.  But what I wanted to ask was, you know, given the size of all the government borrowing and, you know, different regulatory changes in the financial sector, do you think that the Treasury market, long run, can operate smoothly without some sort of active Fed presence—you know, buying Treasury debt?  You know, I’m referring back to [inaudible] Randal Quarles.  He had some questions about it.  So I wanted to know where you stood on that issue. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So—you were breaking up a little.  I think—I think I got the sense of it, though.  Yes, I, I don’t think it’s at all a foregone conclusion that there needs to be a  December 16, 2020  permanent Fed presence.  And we certainly don’t—you know, that’s not something we’re   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL planning on or intending.  Right now we’re buying assets because it’s a—you know, it’s a—it’s a time when the economy needs highly accommodative monetary policy, and we think our asset purchases are, you know, one of the main delivery mechanisms for that, the size of the balance sheet. You know, there’s lots of demand for, for U.S. Treasury paper all—from all over the world.  And I, I think we need to be thoughtful about the structure of the Treasury market and look at ways to make sure that the capacity is there for it to be handled by the private sector.  And there’s, there’s quite a lot of work going on on that front.  But I, I don’t presume at all that, that this is something that needs to be—where the Fed needs to be in there at all.  I, I would think that this should be handled by the private sector and can be.  Institutions need to be able to hold this paper.  And there may be—there may be a central clearing angle that would, you know, net a lot of risk.  That’s, that’s yet to be proven.  There are a lot of things that are being looked at right now. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Hannah Lang. 

[SECTION]

HANNAH LANG.  Hi, hi.  Thanks so much for taking our questions.  So, you know, as you know, the pandemic has really disproportionately impacted small and medium-sized businesses.  And the Fed launched a few efforts this year to—through its 13(3) programs to reach out to those companies.  But, you know, considering that some of those programs are ending, is there anything else that the Fed’s actions can do to provide support to those companies?  Or is that solely Congress’s domain?  December 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I think the main thing that those companies need is a—is a robust recovery—a strong, robust recovery.  And so we, we contribute to that through highly accommodative monetary policy, through accommodative financial conditions that are supporting economic activity.  Health authorities are contributing to that through, through, you know, management of the spread of the virus and now through vaccines and the delivery of those vaccines.  And Congress contributes, contributes to that by helping them make it through this very difficult time.  And, and I think my understanding is that there’s support for small businesses in, in what’s being discussed on Capitol Hill.  I would certainly think that would be something well worth looking at.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Paul La Monica. 

[SECTION]

PAUL LA MONICA.  Hi, Chair Powell—hi, Chair Powell.  I was wondering if you’ve had any conversations yet with any members of the incoming Biden Administration, particularly curious to get your thoughts on how the relationship with Treasury and the new Administration might differ than the past couple of years. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, we’ve had a—and I’ve had sort of the typical meetings with the transition team for Treasury.  They’ve met with quite a lot of people in our agency and other agencies.  And, really, it’s about learning what we do.  And I, I really have only spoken to former Chair Yellen to congratulate her on being nominated and just to say that I look forward to working with her.  You know, I did work very closely with her for five years before she left and have stayed in touch, you know.  So I did that.  But I have not discussed, you know, policy with her.  And I, I’m not going to do that until she’s confirmed. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Great, thank you.  Jeff Cox.  December 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

JEFF COX.  Yes.  Chair, thank you for taking the question.  You’ve been asked this question before in various forms.  I’m going to try it a little bit differently now.  The equity are heading.  We [inaudible] on the stock market, bond yields remain very low.  Does that concern you at all?  Are, are you getting any more concerned about asset valuations in, in light of the highly accommodative Fed policies? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You, you were breaking up, but I, I think I got that.  I think I got it.  So, you know, financial stability—we, we look at a broad range of things.  We actually have a framework so that we can, you know, be—evaluate changes in financial stability over time, and so that the public can evaluate whether we’re doing a job—a good job at it.  We—so what do we look at?  Asset prices is one thing that we look at.  And, you know, we published a report a few weeks ago on that—maybe it was month or so ago.  Anyway.  And I think you’ll find a mixed bag there.  It depends—with equities, it depends on whether you’re looking at P/Es or whether you’re looking at the premium over risk-free—over the risk-free return. If you look at P/Es, they’re historically high, but, you know, in a world where the—where the risk-free rate is sustain—is going to be low for a sustained period, the equity premium, which is really the reward you get for taking equity risk, would be what you’d look at.  And that’s not at, at incredibly low levels, which would mean that they’re not overpriced in that sense.  Admittedly, P/Es are high, but that’s—you know, that’s, that’s maybe not as relevant in a world where we think the 10-year Treasury is going to be lower than it’s been historically, from a—from a return perspective. You know, we look at—we also look at borrowing—leverage of financial institutions.  We spent 10 years and the banks spent 10 years building up their capital.  So far, they’ve been a  December 16, 2020  source of strength through this crisis, and their capital has held up well.  We look at leverage in   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   the nonfinancial sector—that’s households and nonfinancial corporates.  Nonfinancial corporate leverage is high.  We’ve been watching that.  But, you know, rates are really low.  So—and so companies have been able to handle their debt loads even in weak periods, because rates are—rates are quite low.  Your interest payments are low.  Defaults and downgrades have, have been a hit there for people who are unemployed.  But, you know, with the CARES Act, Congress replaced a lot of lost income.  You know, it’s very important that, that the economy gets strong again.  I mean, the, the ultimate thing to support financial stability is a strong economy. The last thing is, is really funding markets.  We found that there was a lot of unstable funding for companies, particularly financial companies.  And that’s, that’s down to a—to a very low level these days.  So the broad financial stability picture is, is kind of mixed, I would say.  I would say, you know, asset prices are, are a little high in that metric and in my view.  But, overall, you have a mixed picture.  You, you don’t have, you know, a lot of red flags on that.  So—and it’s—again, it’s something that we monitor essentially ongoing, almost daily.  You know, we’re, we’re monitoring these prices for that and, and have published our, our framework, and, you know, we’ll be held accountable for what we saw and what we missed.  So we work very hard at it. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  And for the last question we’ll go to Michael McKee. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, I have a couple of questions about the fiscal support for the economy.  This year’s budget deficit is $3.1 trillion.  And Republicans have argued they don’t want to spend more, because we can’t afford it.  So I’m wondering if you can  December 16, 2020  make the case for how much we can afford.  At what point do deficits and the debt start to have   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   an impact on the economy or on interest rates?  And how would we know when we get there? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So people who—people who run for elected office and win, they’re the ones—their reward is they get to make those very difficult decisions.  And—you know, so we’re not charged with providing fiscal advice to, to Congress.  But I, I would just say, as a general—as a general rule, it is important to be on a sustainable fiscal path.  For my way of thinking and many others’, the time to focus on that is when the economy is strong and when unemployment is low and taxes are—you know, are, are pouring in, and there’s, there’s room to get on—get on a sustainable path, because the economy’s really doing well.  You’re still now in the—in the, you know, some part of, of an economic crisis.  And the fact that Congress is debating a fairly large bill today suggests that, that—you know, suggests that something fairly substantial is going to get done, we hope—that what’s being discussed is, you know, is, is of some size. In terms of what is a sustainable level, I think, you know, it’s—the question is—we’ve always looked at debt to GDP, and we’re very high by that measure.  By some other measures, we’re actually not that high.  In particular, you can look at the real interest rate payments, the amount of, what does it cost?  And from that standpoint, if you—if you sort of take real interest costs of the federal deficit and divide that by GDP, we’re actually—you know, we’re actually on a more sustainable fiscal path if you look at it through those eyes.  Again, these are—these are issues for Congress.  But, you know, I’ll just say in the near term, I think fiscal—the case for, for fiscal is, is strong.  And I’m certainly hoping—I think it will be very good for the economy if, if we did get something soon.  December 16, 2020     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Well, the argument for continuing to spend is that low interest rates make it affordable.  Do you worry you get in a situation where you would have congressional interference in monetary policymaking or at least feel significant political pressure to keep rates low because the country can’t afford to pay a significant interest bill? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, I mean, that’s—I think we’re a very, very long way from that.  You know, the, the Congress has given the Fed independence on the condition that we stick to our knitting.  We try very hard to do that.  And I, I think that’s, that’s what people call fiscal dominance.  And I, I think we’re just a very, very long way from that.  I think, you know, if we—if we do our jobs well and support the economy and achieve maximum employment and stable prices, keep the financial system stable, I don’t think that that is something that will—that I would worry about, certainly not in the near term.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Good afternoon.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
41,2021-01-27,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.  Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable asset purchases.  These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete. The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus.  A resurgence in recent months in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths is causing great hardship for millions of Americans and is weighing on economic activity and job creation.  Following a sharp rebound in economic activity last summer, the pace of the recovery has moderated in recent months, with the weakness concentrated in the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing.  Household spending on services remains low, especially in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality.  And household spending on goods has moderated following earlier large gains. In contrast, the housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates.  Business investment and manufacturing production have also picked up.  The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due in part to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which have provided essential support to many families and individuals.  The recently enacted Coronavirus  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL Response and Relief Act [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021] will provide additional support.  Overall economic activity remains below its level before the pandemic, and the path ahead remains highly uncertain. As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed in recent months.  Employment fell by 140,000 in December, as continued gains in many industries were outweighed by significant losses in industries where the resurgence of the virus has weighed further on activity.  In particular, the leisure and hospitality sector lost nearly half a million jobs, largely from restaurants and bars.  The unemployment rate remained elevated at 6.7 percent in December, and participation in the labor market is notably below pre-pandemic levels.  Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, millions of Americans remain out of work.  The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit.  In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics.  The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.  Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer but have leveled out more recently.  For those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft.  Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective. While we should not underestimate the challenges we currently face, several developments point to an improved outlook for later this year.  Sufficiently widespread vaccinations would enable us to put the pandemic behind us and return to more normal economic activities.  In the meantime, continued observance of social-distancing measures and wearing  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL masks will help us reach that goal as soon as possible.  Support from fiscal policy will help households and businesses weather the downturn as well as limit lasting damage to the economy that could otherwise impede the recovery.  In addition, as we have seen since last summer, the economy has proved more resilient than expected, in part reflecting the adaptability of households and businesses.  Finally, monetary policy is playing a key role in supporting the recovery and will continue to do so. The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  Today we unanimously reaffirmed our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, as we typically do each January.  As we say in that statement, we view maximum employment as a “broad-based and inclusive goal.”  Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent. As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.  We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.  With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.  In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  The increase in our balance sheet since last March has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy.  The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. Our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, along with our balance sheet guidance, will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses.  Our guidance is outcome based and ties the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals.  Thus, if progress toward our goals were to slow, the guidance would convey our intention to increase policy accommodation through a lower expected path of the federal funds rate and a higher expected path of the balance sheet.  Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so. We’ve also taken actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy, deploying our emergency lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury.  Although the CARES Act facilities are no—are no longer open to new activity, our other facilities remain in place. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Jeanna Smialek.  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. Thank you for taking our questions.  I was hoping that you would first react to the wild ride that game stock—GameStop’s stock has had this week.  And then, secondarily, you and your colleagues have repeatedly made it clear that you really plan to use macroprudential tools as the first line of defense when it comes to financial stability risks.  But your macroprudential tools primarily apply to the banks.  I’m wondering what your plan is, if you see some sort of large financial stability risk emanating from the nonbank financial sector in the coming months, especially as it relates to search-for-yield kind of activities.  You know, what, what do you see as the solution there?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, on, on your first question, I don’t want to comment on a particular company or, or day’s market activity or things like that.  It’s just not really something that I would typically comment on. In terms of macroprudential policy tools, so, as you know, no doubt, we rely on sort of always-on, through-the-cycle macroprudential policy tools, particularly the stress tests and also the elevated levels of liquidity and capital and, and, and also resolution planning that we—that we impose on the largest financial institutions.  We don’t use time-varying tests and tools as some other countries do.  And we think it’s a good approach because—for us to use ones that are always-on—because we don’t really think we’d be successful in every case in picking the exact right time to intervene in markets.  So that’s for banks. You really asked about nonbanks, the nonbank sector.  And so we monitor financial conditions very broadly.  And while we don’t have jurisdiction over, over many areas in the nonbank sector, other agencies do.  And so we do coordinate through the Financial Stability Oversight Council and with other agencies who have responsibility for, for nonbank supervision.   January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL And, in fact, as you know, in the last crisis, the banking system held up fairly well so far.  And, and the dislocations that we saw from the outsized economic and financial shock of the pandemic really appeared in the nonbank sector.  So that’s—right now we are engaged in, in carefully examining, understanding, and thinking about what, what in the nonbank sector will need to be addressed in the next year or so. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  James Politi, FT. 

[SECTION]

JAMES POLITI.  Thank you so much, Michelle and Chair Powell.  I had a question on fiscal policy.  Last year you consistently said that the economy needed more fiscal support and, I believe, were pleased when the $900 billion package was approved in December.  We have—now have a new, new President, a new Congress.  We have a weakening short-term outlook.  Do you believe the economy still needs additional support on the fiscal side?  And in what areas? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  So I guess I’d start by saying that the, the fiscal response that we’ve seen to this downturn has been strong, and I think we can say now that it’s been sustained after the passage of the—of the, the most recent act in, in late December.  And that’s really a key reason why the recovery has been as strong as it’s been.  Fiscal policy has been absolutely essential.  When we look back on, on the history of this period, we’ll see a strong and sustained fiscal policy response. I would—I would add that we’re, as I mentioned, a long way from a full recovery.  Something like 9 million people remain unemployed as a consequence of the pandemic.  That’s as many people as lost their jobs at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis and the Great Recession.  Many small businesses are under pressure, and there are other needs to be addressed.  And the path ahead is still pretty uncertain.  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL So, all of that said, the judgment on how much to spend and in what way is really one for Congress and the Administration and not for the Fed.  And these discussions are going on right now.  So there’s a discussion, as you know, right now around, around those precise questions, and, and that’s appropriate, but not for us to play a role in talking about specific policies. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Steve Liesman. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wonder if I could follow up on Jeanna’s question here.  I understand that you do address issues of, of valuations through macroprudential policies in the first instance, but there’s a range of assets.  And I know you do watch a range of assets.  But from Bitcoin to corporate bonds to the stock market in general to some of these more specific meteoric rises in stocks like GameStop, how do you address the concern that super easy monetary policy—asset purchases and zero interest rates—are potentially fueling a bubble that could cause economic fallout should it burst? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Let me—let me provide a little context.  The shock that the—from the pandemic was unprecedented both in its nature and in its size and in the amount of unemployment that it created and in the shock to economic activity.  There’s nothing close to it in our modern economic history.  So our response was really to that.  And we—we’ve done what we could, first, to restore market function and to provide a bit of relief, then to support the recovery.  And, hopefully, we’ll be able to do the third thing, which is to avoid longer-run damage to the—to the economy. Our role assigned by Congress is maximum employment and stable prices and also look after financial stability.  So, in a world where, almost a year later, we’re, we’re still 9 million jobs, at least—that’s one way of counting it; it can actually be counted much higher than that—short of maximum employment and people are out of the labor force who were in the labor  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL force—the real unemployment rate is close to 10 percent if you include people that’ve left the labor force—it’s very much appropriate that monetary policy be highly accommodative to support maximum employment and price stability, which is getting inflation back to 2 percent and averaging 2 percent over time. So, on, on matters of financial stability, we have a framework.  We don’t look at one thing or two things.  We look at—and we made that framework public after the financial crisis so that it could be criticized and understood and we could be held accountable.  And, you know, the things that we look at are—we do look at asset prices.  We also look at leverage in the banking system.  We look at leverage in the non—the nonbanking system, which is to say, corporates and households.  And we look at also funding risk.  And if you look at it across that range of, of, of readings, they’re each different, but we monitor them carefully.  And I would say that financial stability vulnerabilities overall are moderate. Our overall goal is to assure that the financial system itself is resilient to, to shocks of all kinds, that it’s strong and resilient.  And that includes not just the banks, but money market funds and, and all different kinds of nonbank financial structures as well.  So when we get to the nonfinancial sector, we don’t—we don’t have jurisdiction over that. But—so I would just say that our—that there are many things that go in, as you know, to, to setting asset prices.  So if you look at what’s really been driving asset prices, really, in the last couple of months, it isn’t monetary policy.  It’s been expectations about vaccines.  And it’s also financial—sorry, fiscal policy.  Those are—those are the news items that have been driving, driving asset purchases—sorry, asset values in, in recent months. So I, I know that monetary policy does play a role there, but that’s how we look at it.  And I think, you know, I think that the connection between low interest rates and, and asset  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL values is probably something that’s not as tight as people think, because a lot of—a lot of different factors are driving asset prices at any given time. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Can I follow up, Michelle, if you don’t mind?  Mr. Chairman, do you rule out or see as one of your tools in the toolkit the idea of adjusting monetary policy to address asset values? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, that’s—as you know, that’s one of the very difficult questions in all of monetary policy.  And we don’t rule it out as a theoretical matter, but we, we clearly look to macroprudential tools, regulatory tools, supervisory tools, other kinds of tools rather than monetary policy in, in addressing financial stability issues.  It’s not—you know, the, the monetary policy we know strengthens economic activity and job creation through fairly well-understood channels.  And a strong economy is actually a great supporter of financial stability.  That will mean strong, you know, well-capitalized institutions, and, and households will be—will be working.  And, and so we know that. We don’t actually understand the tradeoff between—the sense of it is, would you—if you raise interest rates and thereby tighten financial conditions and reduce economic activity now in order to address asset bubbles and things like that, what—will that even help?  Will it—will it actually cause more damage, or will it help?  So I think that’s unresolved.  And I, I think it’s, it’s something we, we look at as not, not theoretically ruled out but not something we, we—we’ve ever done and not something we would plan to do.  We would rely on macroprudential and other tools to deal with financial stability issues. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Michael Derby.  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Yes.  Thank you very much.  I wanted to ask you, if there is a near-term rise in inflation related to the recovery, how will you determine whether or not it’s something that’s temporary or more enduring?  And how much inflation is the Fed willing to tolerate before it acts to restrain price pressures? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, on inflation, a couple of things—there are a couple of things that are worth mentioning.  One is just that we know that we measure inflation on a trailing 12-month basis.  And as we—as we lap the very low inflation readings of March and April of last year, we’ll see measured 12-month inflation move up a few tenths.  This is just—they’re called base effects, and, and that’s a—that’s a transient thing that we think will pass. There’s also the possibility—indeed, it’s in some forecasts—that as the economy fully reopens, there’ll be a burst of spending, and—because people will be enthusiastic that the pandemic is over, potentially, and that that could also create some upward pressure on inflation.  Now, again, we would see that as something likely to be transient and not to be very large.  In both cases, we don’t see those as either lasting or particularly large.  So the way we would react is, we’re going to be patient.  Expect us to wait and see and not react if we see small and what we would review—we would view as very likely to be transient effects on inflation. I think if you—you know, it helps to look back at, at the inflation dynamics that the United States has had now for some decades and notice that there has been, you know, significant disinflationary pressure for some time, for a couple of decades.  Inflation has averaged less than 2 percent for a quarter of a century.  And the inflation dynamics, with the flat Phillips curve and low persistence of inflation, is very much intact.  Those things, they change over time.  We understand that inflation dynamics evolve constantly over time, but they don’t  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL change rapidly.  So we think it’s very unlikely that anything we see now would result in, you know, troubling inflation. Of course, if we did get sustained inflation at a level that was uncomfortable, we have tools for that.  It’s far harder to deal with, with too low inflation.  We know what to do with higher inflation, which is, you know, should the need arise, we, we would have those tools.  And we don’t expect to see that at all. In terms of how much, you know, what we’ve said is we’d like to see—because inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we’d like to see it run moderately above 2 percent for some time.  We have not adopted a formula.  We’re not going to adopt a formula.  We’re going to—we, we use policy rules and formulas in everything we do, consult them constantly, but we don’t set policy by them.  We don’t do that.  And so we’re going to preserve an element of judgment. And, again, we’ll seek inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.  And we’ll, we’ll show what that means when we get inflation above 2 percent.  The, the way to achieve credibility on that is to actually do it.  And so that’s what we’re planning on doing. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Rachel Siegel. 

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions.  I have a two-pronged question about vaccines.  So you specifically mentioned progress in the rollout of vaccines, but there is still plenty that we don’t know about supply over the coming weeks and months.  So I’m curious how you and your colleagues are factoring in vaccine rollouts and funding for distribution in your forecasts and what that timeline looks like. And then, secondly, I’m wondering if you, yourself haven’t—has been—have been vaccinated, along with other FOMC members.  Thank you.  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, in terms of the rollout of the vaccines, we see what everyone else sees, right?  We see that we’re, we’re vaccinating people and at a rate of about a million a day, apparently, and that it’ll take quite a while to get—to get to the numbers that the experts say are required to get to herd immunity.  And we think it’s going to be a struggle. You’ll notice that we, we said that the, the pandemic still, still provides considerable downside risks to the economy.  And that’s one of the reasons why, is that—is the slowness of the rollout.  The other—another reason why is just the arrival of these new virus strains.  We don’t know how to—we don’t know how to model that.  You know, we can have a base case, but we realize no one knows how the—how this new vaccine will roll out, how successful it will be, how high we’ll be able to drive vaccination, and those sorts of things. So we have a base case, and we—but we always—we always look at, at the range of possibilities.  In this case, we particularly look at the downside risks.  You know, that’s really what we do is, we, we set policies so that we’re, we’re, you know, we’re going to remain accommodative until we actually see improvement in the economy and not just in the outlook, in the data.  So that’s, that’s how we think about, about that. And I would—I would also add, there’s nothing more important to the economy now than, than people getting vaccinated.  You know, if you—if you, you think about the places where the economy is weak—I mentioned bars and restaurants.  That’s 400,000 jobs we lost last month, and that’s all because of the spread of the pandemic.  Many other areas of the economy—actually, there was actually job creation in—you know, in goods production and in some service parts—industries as well.  But we’re just not going to be able to get that last group of people back to work—and it’s a big group of people—until we get the pandemic behind us.  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL We, we have not won this yet.  We haven’t succeeded in doing this yet, and we need to stay focused on it as a country and, and get there.  And, you know, we clearly can, but we’re going to have to stay focused.  And that includes—you know, that includes us at the Fed, monetary policy. Thank you. I, I have been vaccinated once, and I expect to get my second vaccine sometime soon.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Michael McKee. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  A question—I have a question that I was going to ask, but I need to follow up for a second on the questions about the markets and macroprudential, and that is, you have one tool you can use.  Would you be discussing—have you discussed raising margin requirements under Regulation T?  And, if not, why not? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  No, we haven’t—we haven’t done that.  I mean, remember, we’re, we’re focused on maximum employment, price stability, financial stability as I defined it—the broad financial sector.  And, and that—that’s not, you know—over the years, we, we consult the fact that we have that authority.  But, no, it’s not something we’re looking at right now at all. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  All right.  My follow-up question is, a lot of people in the markets think that you’re basically stuck right now, because you can’t really go lower with the zero bound, rejecting negative interest rates, and you can’t really go higher because of the threat of a taper tantrum.  Is the Fed locked into a very narrow corridor now?  And, if not, you did say you would signal any change in interest rates a long time ahead.  But [former] New York Fed President Bill Dudley says there’s no way you can avoid a taper tantrum.  So how do you do that?  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Well, first, I—we, we think our policy stance is, is just right.  We think it’s providing significant support for economic activity and hiring.  We, you know, we, we adopted a new monetary policy framework of flexible average inflation targeting in August.  In new framework.  In December, we did the same for asset purchases. So we now have, you know, strong guidance on, on rates and on asset purchases that’s providing very strong support for economic activity.  If you look at the sectors of the economy that are interest sensitive, you will see very strong activity:  housing, durable goods, automobile sales.  So, you know, our, our policies are working.  And we think that, that they are—we think our policy stance is, is right. That said, there’s clearly more that we can do.  With asset purchases, for example, we can, you know—that’s, that’s a tool we can do more—we can strengthen our guidance, too, if we were to think that that were appropriate.  What you see is an economy where what’s holding it back is not the lack of, of policy support from the Fed.  It’s the pandemic.  It’s, it’s the spread of the disease and people’s reluctance or, or inability to partake in certain kinds of economic activities, which amount to a, a meaningful part of the economy.  So that’s, that’s what I would say.  We certainly have things that we can do, but we think we’re—we think we’re in the right place. You know, in terms of—in terms of tapering, it’s just premature.  We just created the, the guidance.  We said we’d want to see substantial further progress toward our goals before we modify our, our asset purchase guidance.  It’s just too early to be talking about dates, which we should be focused on, on progress.  We’ll need to see actual progress.  And when, when we see ourselves getting to that point, we’ll communicate clearly about it to, to the public so nobody  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL will be surprised when the time comes.  And we’ll do that well in advance of actually considering what will be a pretty gradual taper. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Well, if I might, you—your policies are working, and you can 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So, you know, I, I was here—we had all the same questions back in—after the Global Financial Crisis.  We raised interest rates.  We froze the balance sheet size, and then we shrank the balance sheet size.  So there’s no reason why we, we won’t be able to do that again.  In fact, we learned a lot from that experience. And, you know, we, we understand—as we understood then, but even more so—we understand that the—that the way to do it is to communicate well in advance, to, to do predictable things, and to move gradually.  And that’s, that’s what we’re going to do.  We’re going to be very transparent. But, honestly, no—you know, the whole focus on exit is premature, if I may say.  We’re focused on finishing the job we’re doing, which is to support the economy, to give the economy the support it needs.  There are people out there who’ve lost their jobs.  It’s essential that we get them back to work as quickly as possible, and we want to do everything we can to do that.  And that is our primary focus right now.  It’s, it’s, it’s too soon to be—to be worried about that.  You know, when we come to exit, we have a—we have an understanding of how to do that, and we’ll do it very carefully.  But in the meantime, our focus is on giving the economy the support

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Victoria Guida. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I just wanted to go back to fiscal stimulus for a second.  You know, we just had a $900 billion package, and now Congress is talking about doing it needs.  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL more.  Do you expect more aid directly to consumers to be inflationary?  And, specifically, how worried should lawmakers be about, you know, causing concerning levels of inflation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I, I would say that, again, we have been struggling with disinflationary forces for some time.  If you look around the world—look in Western Europe, look at Japan—around the world, large economies have, have felt much more downward pressure on inflation, have fallen short of their inflation goals, for some time now.  That is the broad global macroeconomic context that we all live in. And we believe that those global forces—which are, you know, aging demographics, advancing technology, and globalization—those, those forces are still in effect.  Now, they may slow down, and, and it’s, it’s an interesting question, the extent to which, for example, globalization may slow down or even reverse.  Notwithstanding that, inflation dynamics in the United States have, have consisted of a flat Phillips curve and low persistence for, for a long time.  We do not expect in the near term that that will change significantly.  It may evolve over time, but significant time.  You know, these things are—these things are, are changing, but they don’t change at a rapid rate.  And there’s—I, I don’t believe that, that they will. So I wouldn’t—I’m, I’m not—I’m much more worried about falling short of a complete recovery and losing people’s careers and lives that they—that they built because they don’t get to work—back to work in time and things like that.  I’m more concerned about that and the damage that will do not just to their lives, but to the United States economy, to the productive capacity of the economy.  I’m more concerned about that than about the possibility, which exists, of higher inflation.  Frankly, we welcome slightly higher inflation, somewhat higher inflation.  The kind of troubling inflation that people like me grew up with seems, seems far away and unlikely in, in the both domestic and global context that we’ve been in for some time.  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Steve Matthews, Bloomberg. 

[SECTION]

STEVE MATTHEWS.  Chair Powell, Treasury Secretary Yellen, in a memo to her employees yesterday, spoke of the close working relationship with the Federal Reserve.  And I’m wondering how you would describe the relationship with, with Treasury under Chair Yellen, if you’ve met with, with, with Treasury Secretary Yellen and, and/or President Biden since he has taken office. And, you know, secondly, about that, as you know, in the last four years, there was constant criticism from the—of the Fed from the President and from other officials of the Administration.  Do you have any kind of assurance or expectation that this will now be more of a hands-off attitude, in terms of commenting on monetary policy from the Administration? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  So I have the highest respect and admiration for Secretary Yellen.  And I’m, I’m sure that we’re going to have a, a good working relationship together.  Absolutely sure.  We’ll also have a good institutional relationship between the Fed and the Treasury.  And I expect that that’ll be very good and, and very productive.  It’ll be collaborative.  We’ll work together. Now, the way that works is, is that, you know, we know—the agencies know each other well, and this is true of finance ministries and central banks around the world.  We know to stay in our lanes.  We know we have different authorities.  We know that we work together on some things to—you know, for the benefit of the public.  And I’m, I’m absolutely sure that we’re going to do that. I, you know, haven’t—I haven’t spoken to, to Secretary Yellen—I’m going to be calling her “Chair Yellen” most of the time, so you just have to be patient with me—Secretary Yellen.  I haven’t spoken to her since I congratulated her on being nominated.  I do expect very soon to  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL begin our regular calls or—and, and ultimately meetings, which have gone on, really, for, you know, 70 years.  The Treasury Secretary and the, and the Fed Chair have had weekly or so meetings, lunches, breakfast, calls, depending on the situation.  So I expect that will—that will happen soon. I’ve—I have not met the, the President, President Biden.  And just, you know, I, I, I don’t—I don’t have any comment on your—on your last question.  I wouldn’t want to comment one way or the other. 

[SECTION]

STEVE MATTHEWS. Just to follow up briefly, you have some 13(3) emergency programs that will expire March 31 that the Fed and the Treasury have worked on together.  Do you have an expectation of whether those will be left, left to expire then or whether they will be extended? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I—I’ll just say that I think our facilities were very successful in supporting the economy during its darkest moments and I believe saved—protected the loss of millions of jobs.  We’re going to continue to monitor financial and credit conditions throughout the economy.  And, and if the kind of emergency conditions arise that are required under that law, then our emergency lending tools will remain available. Now, I’ve had no discussions with anybody at Treasury on that, because I haven’t had any discussions with anybody at Treasury other than meet—you know, high-level meetings with the—with the transition team a month or so ago.  And once we start having those, those meetings, of course, I’ll observe, you know, the long-standing practice of not talking about confidential discussions.  But as of now, there haven’t been any discussions at all. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Howard Schneider, Reuters.  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing this.  So a couple questions on timing.  In the statement, you removed—regarding the coronavirus—you removed the time reference “short and medium term” when it comes to the risks to the economic outlook, and it simply now says “considerable risks to the economic outlook.”  Should we read that as a sort of a positive change that you, you now see an end—sort of the endgame of this down the road?  Or is it more that you’re, you’re worried it could last longer than you expect?  And a related issue, have you given any guidance yet to the Fed staff or System on when the Fed itself might resume in-person events? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So in the statement, on the language, we dropped “in the medium term,” because, really, the risks are, are in the near term, frankly.  You know, as I mentioned, it’s the rollout of the vaccine.  It’s the arrival of new strains that, that are more contagious and perhaps more virulent.  And those are the—those are the—and also just the ongoing—third thing, of course, is the ongoing spread of the virus.  It’s, it’s in the near term.  It’s not in the medium term.  We were thinking—when we were thinking “medium term,” we were thinking of longer-term scarring and things like that. Nonetheless, I mean, I think what—to go to your, your second question, and as I mentioned in my, in my opening remarks—there is good evidence to, to support a stronger economy in the second half of this year.  In fact, if you look at, at—as we do—look at a range of private forecasters, what was their forecast in, in December, and what’s their forecast now?  Right across the board:  much higher forecasts for 2021 growth.  And that’s because of the ongoing rollout of the vaccines and also because of fiscal policy, expectations, and the reality of, of the CRRA Act [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021] getting done.  So there is—there is a positive case there.  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL But that—think of that as—the sort of base case is, is a strong economy in the second half of the year.  The language says that there’s still—I forget the exact language—downside risks.  We used an adjective.  It was “considerable”—“considerable risks to the economic outlook.”  So there are considerable risks, risks to the economic outlook.  Nonetheless, that is—that is a more positive outlook.  And that’s really how, how I would—I would parse that for you. I don’t know when we’re going to come back to work, and I’m, I’m actually in the Eccles Building here today.  And I don’t know when that’ll be.  I mean, we—I can’t wait to be working in person again.  But, you know, we—we’ve been able to work successfully remotely.  We really have.  And, you know, we’re not going to push people when they’re uncomfortable.  We’re going to wait till people are comfortable and wait till it’s well and truly time to get back together in person.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Hannah Lang. 

[SECTION]

HANNAH LANG.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you so much for taking our questions.  The Fed in December eased its restrictions on bank dividend payments and share repurchases.  And so I wanted to ask what factors the Fed will be looking at to determine what level banks can pay out in the second quarter and when we can expect such a decision. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  So we’re, we’re monitoring that on an ongoing basis, continue to—continuing to evaluate our, our restrictions.  And we haven’t made a decision about whether to continue them in the second quarter or not.  We’re just going to look at bank—we’re going to look at the whole range of, of information, including economic activity, banking activity, the, the success in vaccination.  All of those things will go into our assessment of what the right answer is to that question.  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL I think we’ve been careful about, about rolling back those restrictions.  And, and I’m pleased with where we are.  Let’s remember that the banks—that the banks that are subject to the stress tests have taken very, very large reserves—very large loss reserves, and also increased their capital.  They’ve actually had—they have higher capital ratios now than they had at the beginning of the pandemic.  So the banking system has held up well here.  And, and—but, you know, we’re going to be careful about this and, you know, move based on data, and all of the data, when we make that decision. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Edward Lawrence. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Mr. Chairman, thank you for taking the question.  So I’m interested in the housing sector.  Home prices are rising, 9 percent in some areas, because of low interest rates.  Are you concerned about a bubble forming there yet?  And is there a price increase, you know, that you’re looking at where it might change the level of mortgage-backed securities the Fed is buying?  And, as a continuation of that, is the bubble in the corporate debt cycle more concerning for you? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, on housing, you know, housing is now—the level of housing activity is at its highest level since before the Global Financial Crisis, in some measures.  So we’ve had a very strong rebound in housing.  Some of the, the tightness in housing markets, we think—which has led to the, the significant price increases this year—we think is, is a passing phenomenon.  There was a lot of pent-up demand. There’s a one-time thing happening with people who are spending all of their time in their house, and they’re thinking either “I need a bigger house” or “I need another house and a different house—or a second house,” in some cases.  So there’s just—there’s a—there’s a one-time shift in demand that we think will get satisfied—also, that will call forth supply.  And that  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL will—that will, we think—we think that those price increases are unlikely to be sustained for, for all of those reasons. So you asked about corporate debt, I guess?  

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Yes.  I’m just concerned if that’s a bubble that you’re watching. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we, we monitor pretty much all of the big financial markets pretty carefully.  And, you know, what’s happened in, in the corporate debt market, beginning with the announcement of our corporate credit facility, has been, you’ve seen lenders lending and borrowers borrowing.  You’ve seen relatively significantly fewer defaults than we—than we expected.  There were a lot of downgrades and some defaults at the beginning, and those have really slowed down. And, by the way, the same is true for bank loans.  Banks are not experiencing the kinds of defaults that, that we all were concerned about in the early months of the pandemic.  It’s just not materializing.  So they’re having to reverse some of their loss reserves, actually. Debts—corporate debt spreads are, are tight.  They’ve tightened.  They were very broad—high—wide, of course, at the—during the acute phase of the pandemic, and they’ve—you know, they’re now at the lower end of their typical range.  And we do monitor that. You know, it’s, it’s not something we can control or operate on directly, but we do—we do watch those things.  And, you know, in a sense, it’s good that companies have been able to finance themselves during this period, because they—they’ve been able to stay in business.  They’ve been able to keep their employees working.  And, you know, that’s a good thing.  And that’s, that’s part of highly accommodative financial conditions. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thanks.  Chris Rugaber.  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Thanks.  Can you—since you suggested that the concern from the pandemic is perhaps a shorter-term concern and that’s why you removed some of the language from the statement, can you talk about what kind of impact you’re seeing so far? Do you feel that structural impacts have been—how would you characterize those?  I know that’s been a major concern—you’ve talked about at this press conference and others.  Do we see longer-term damage to the job market?  Have—or has there been some success in preventing that?  And, compared to previous recessions, how would you characterize the damage to the job market here, in terms of things like, you know, permanent job loss, workers that need to shift industries, that kind of thing? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, the, the, the big thing is that the jury’s out.  And this has been a concern since the very beginning, is the concern that people—if, if they become disconnected from the industry or the job where—that they used to work in, it, it can be years or never when they get back into the labor force, particularly for people who are well along in their careers—the same kind of scarring for small businesses, which don’t have the kind of resources that you need to get through this.  So we’ve, we’ve had a big concern about, about both of those. We haven’t seen as much of it as we—as we feared.  And that’s a good thing.  But as I said that, you know, the jury is out here—9 or 10 million people still out of work because of the pandemic.  They’re—a big chunk of them are people who worked in public-facing jobs in the service sector.  And, you know, they’ve gotten a lot of support from fiscal policy and some from monetary policy. But the question is getting them back to work.  And, you know, it’s, it’s harder if you’re—it takes longer, empirically, to find that next job if you’re looking at a brand-new industry.  It’s not easy to change careers completely midcareer.  So that just, again, stresses the  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL urgency that we feel and others feel at, at, you know, fully defeating the pandemic, finishing the job and getting back to a place where it’s safe to have these—you know, to, to, to stay in hotels, to fly on airplanes, to go to sporting events and movie theaters, and all of those things. So those people are still at risk.  And we’re, we’re very, very focused on that group of people with our policy and, and, and, you know, the way we look at the economy.  So many people have had that bridge across the pandemic.  You know, we talked about that at the beginning.  For many people, it’s clear that they’ve made it across, and their job is okay, and their house is okay.  And, you know, it’s been terribly inconvenient and painful, and schools are closed and things like that.  But there, there’s a bunch of people yet who haven’t found that bridge yet.  And we’re, we’re very focused on that. Of course, the other thing is, we’re going to a different economy.  And we’re going to be learning more about that as we go.  But, clearly, we’re, we’re learning that things can be done from remote locations.  We’re learning that technology can replace people even more than we thought.  And some of that is happening. So I think as we, you know, as we get into this, you know, the phase after—even after the economy fully reopens, I think we’re still going to need to keep people in mind whose lives have been disrupted, because they’ve lost that—the work that they did.  And I think it would be wise as a country, for the longer-run productive capacity of the country, if we were to look out for those people and help them find their way back into the labor force even if it means continuing support for an additional period of time. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Great.  If I could ask this quick follow—yesterday Susan Rice, domestic policy advisor at the White House, talked about a Citigroup study that said closing racial economic gaps could add up to $5 trillion to the U.S. economy over the next five  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL years and 6 million new jobs.  Do you agree that racial disparities are currently a drag on the economy?  And, if so, what can the Fed do proactively to narrow those racial gaps in income and wealth, including potentially through regulatory policy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I strongly agree with that, as a matter of fact.  I think if you look at either—look at employment gaps or unemployment gaps or wage gaps, wealth gaps, homeowning gaps, all of those persistent gaps that exist even controlling for many other factors, you will see that they’re, they’re persistent, they’re—and they’re very difficult to explain. And so it’s—the reason we talk about inequality and, and racial inequality in particular, is that it goes to our job, which is to achieve maximum employment, which, which links up with, with—we want—we want the potential output of the United States to be as high as it can possibly be.  We want—we want an economy where everybody can take part and everybody, everybody can put their labor in, and they can share in the prosperity of our great economy.  That’s what we want.  And that’s how the U.S. economy can be bigger, stronger, growing faster, is if we can achieve a more—a broader prosperity. So, now, in terms of our tools, you know, of course, that project that I just mentioned is one for the broader society, for the private sector, for fiscal policy, but we have a role to play.  And, and that is, how we think about the labor market.  Principally, when we say that the maximum employment is a, a broad and inclusive goal, what we’re—what we’re saying there is, we’re not just going to look at the headline—and we never did, really, but—we’re not going to just look at the headline numbers.  We’re going to look at different demographic groups, including women, minorities, and others.  And we’re not going to say that we’ve reached maximum employment, which is our statutory goal, until we’ve reached maximum employment.   January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL And you haven’t if, if there’s lots of pockets of, of people not participating in or not employed in the labor market.  So those are the things that we can do. We also do a tremendous amount of research on these issues.  You know, we do—we, we have such a focus on these issues now that we actually—we, we have a new, a webpage, relatively new, where you can access all of it.  But it’s a lot of activities in our Division of Consumer and Community Affairs.  It’s lots of research, and, and it’s also, you know, our enforcement of the fair lending laws and things like that.  So I think everybody’s got a role to play here.  It’s a—it’s a national goal and a national job, and we’re just going to do our part of the job.  And it’s something we’re strongly committed to. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  For the last question, we’ll go to Scott Horsley at NPR. 

[SECTION]

SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  You said in your opening remarks that the, the economy in many ways had proven more resilient than, than people expected, and that that reflected the adaptability of both households and businesses.  Are, are there adaptations that caught you by surprise, maybe related to remote work or new ways to do on-site work, in-person, face-to-face work that, that the economy’s proven tougher than, than you expected at the outset of this pandemic? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, yes.  So I think, if you go back to the—to the beginning, there was a real concern.  I mean, just, just take the financial markets, for example.  Suddenly, all of those big buildings all over the, the—New York City and all around the world where people work in the financial markets with terminals and everything, everybody had to go home, and they had to take their terminals with them.  And I think there was a real concern that there would be a tremendous loss of functionality just at the time when the financial markets were under  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL historically difficult conditions.  And yet, it worked out okay.  So I think people—many people in the financial sector are still working with their terminals at home, including people on trading floors or on virtual trading floors. Now, some of that’s reversing now.  But we have definitely learned that we can do more work from home in many, many different lines of work.  Of course, that’s not possible if your job involves being at a place, doing personal services.  For many people, it’s not possible.  And that’s very much something that skews to higher-income, higher-educated people being able to work from home and others not so much.  So I think we’ve learned that. The other thing, though, even conditional on that, when we saw the wave in the South and the West, the wave of cases this summer, I think, intuitively, having seen what happened in of just got on with their lives and went and, and dealt with it.  And, and it didn’t actually—it had a much smaller effect on economic activity than we expected.  Then comes the fall wave, which is just so much larger—a very, very large wave as, as was very much forecast.  People going indoors, the cold weather, all of that.  And even there, if you look at—I would say, look at the December jobs report.  So, big job losses in, you know, in that part of the service sector.  So I mentioned 400,000 jobs in bars and restaurants.  There’s another 100,000 in similar kinds of activities.  But if you go—if you look elsewhere, it’s not having an effect.  You know, even purchasing manager index and sentiment indexes on, on areas of the economy that are not directly—really directly—exposed to the pandemic in their economic activity, they’re doing okay.  They are. Housing is a great example.  You know, the way—the way—the way the housing industry worked, that when you buy a house, there was a lot of in-person contact.  They managed  January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL to pretty much immediately go to a more virtual—you know, with all the technology.  They were able to completely avoid that.  And the housing market has been really strong, notwithstanding that it’s, it’s now quite virtual rather than in person. So there’s been a lot of adapting, and—but you can’t adapt, you know, hotels, sporting venues, movie theaters, restaurants, bars.  You just—you know, those are just going to—and that’s—again, that’s millions and millions of people.  And so you’re just going to have to defeat the pandemic, which, as I mentioned, you know, we, we have a plan to do that, but we haven’t done it yet. And we need to—we need to finish the job.  And we—it’s, it’s within our power to do that as a country this year.  And I would just urge that—and I know people are working hard on that.  But that, that is really the main thing about the economy, is, is getting the pandemic under control, getting everyone vaccinated, getting people wearing masks, and all that.  That’s the single most important economic growth policy that we can have.  Thank you.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
42,2021-03-17,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  I would like to start by noting that it has been a full year since the pandemic arrived with force on our shores.  Looking back, it was clear that addressing a fast-moving global pandemic would be plainly and primarily the realm of health-care providers and experts, and we are grateful to them and to all the essential workers for their service and sacrifice.  The danger to the U.S. economy was also clear.  Congress provided by far the fastest and largest response to any postwar economic downturn, offering fiscal support for households, businesses, health-care providers, and state and local governments. Here at the Federal Reserve, we rapidly deployed our full range of tools to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.  We are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability. The economic fallout has been real and widespread, but with the benefit of perspective, we can say that some of the very worst economic outcomes have been avoided by swift and forceful action—from Congress, from across government, and in cities and towns across the country.  More people held on to their jobs, more businesses kept their doors open, and more incomes were saved as a result of these swift and forceful policy actions.  And while we welcome these positive developments, no one should be complacent.  At the Fed, we will continue to provide the economy the support that it needs for as long as it takes. Today the FOMC kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable asset purchases.  These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete.  March 17, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and the measures undertaken to control its spread.  Since January, the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths has fallen, and ongoing vaccinations offer hope for a return to more normal conditions later this year.  In the meantime, continued observance of social-distancing measures and wearing masks will help us reach that goal as soon as possible.  The economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead remains uncertain. Following the moderation in the pace of the recovery that began toward the end of last year, indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing remain weak.  Household spending on goods has risen notably so far this year.  In contrast, household spending on services remains low, especially in services that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality.  The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing production have also picked up. The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due importantly to unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy actions, which have provided essential support to households, businesses, and communities.  The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up notably since our December Summary of Economic Projections.  In commenting on the stronger outlook, participants noted progress on vaccinations as well as recent fiscal As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have turned up recently.  Employment rose by 379,000 in February, as the leisure and hospitality sector recouped about policy.  March 17, 2021  two-thirds of the jobs that were lost in December and January.  Nonetheless, employment in this Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL sector is more than 3 million below its level at the onset of the pandemic.  For the economy as a whole, employment is 9.5 million below its pre-pandemic level.  The unemployment rate remains elevated at 6.2 percent in February; this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemic levels. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and moves down to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.  The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit.  In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics.  The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. Overall inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective.  Over the next few months, 12-month measures of inflation will move up as the very low readings from March and pressure on prices if spending rebounds quickly as the economy continues to reopen, particularly if supply bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term.  However, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transient effects on inflation.  The median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4 percent this year and declines to 2 percent next year before moving back up by the end of 2023. The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the financial—the stability of the financial system.  As we say in our Statement on  March 17, 2021  Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a “broad-Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL based and inclusive goal.”  Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent. As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.  We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.  With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.  I would note that a transitory rise in inflation above 2 percent, as seems likely to occur this year, would not meet this standard. In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  The increase in our balance sheet since last March has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy.  The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. Our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, along with our balance sheet guidance, will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses.  Our guidance is outcome based and ties the path of the federal funds rate and the  March 17, 2021  balance sheet to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals.  Overall, our Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.

JOE PAVEL.  Howard from Reuters. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi, Chair Powell, and, and thanks for that.  So could you talk us through how the, the forecasts for 2021 map into the “substantial further progress” definition—you know, 2.4 percent inflation—I understand that’s considered transitory.  That still seems like some progress there, 4½ percent unemployment.  Is it time to start talking about talking about tapering yet? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  [Laughter]  Not yet.  So, as you—as you pointed out, we’ve said that we would continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress.  And that’s actual progress, not forecast progress.  So—and that’s a difference from, from our past approach.  So—and what we mean by that is, is pretty straightforward.  It is, we want to see that, that the labor markets have moved—labor market conditions have moved—you know, have made substantial progress toward maximum employment, and inflation has made substantial progress toward the 2 percent goal.  That’s what we’re going to want to see.  Now, that obviously includes an element of judgment.  And when we see—we’ll be—we’ll be carefully looking ahead.  March 17, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL We, we also understand that we, we will want to provide as much advance notice of any potential taper as possible.  So when we see that we’re on track, when we see actual data coming in that suggests that we’re on track to perhaps achieve substantial further progress, then we’ll say so.  And we’ll say so well in advance of any decision to actually taper. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  If, if I could follow up on that, this shift in the dots—why wouldn’t that suggest a weakening of the commitment here?  An awful lot of people shifted into 2022, it seems. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I, I don’t see that at all.  You know, we, we have a, a range of perspectives on the Committee.  I welcome that.  And, you know, we, we have—we debate things, we discuss things, and we always come together around a—around a, a solution.  But, you know, the, the strong bulk of the Committee is, is not showing a rate increase during this forecast period.  And, you know, as, as data improve, as the outlook improves very significantly since the December meeting, you would expect forecasts to move up.  It’s probably not a surprise that some people would bring in their estimate of the appropriate time for liftoff. Nonetheless, you know, the bulk of the Committee—the, the largest part by far of the Committee is, is—doesn’t show a rate increase during this period.  And, again, part of that is wanting to see actual data rather than just a forecast at this point.  We do expect that we’ll begin to make faster progress on both spending—you know, labor markets and inflation as the year goes on because of the progress with the vaccines, because of the fiscal support that we’re getting.  We expect that to happen.  But, you know, we’ll have to see it first. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Great, thank you.  Victoria. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I wanted to ask about the supplementary leverage ratio.  You know, there’s been a lot of talk about what you all are going to do this  March 17, 2021  month, which—I’m happy to hear an update if you have one.  But just sort of more broadly, do Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL you think, long term, that the leverage ratio poses problems for implementing monetary policy at a time when the reserve supply is going to remain large?  And, if so, do you think the changes to the leverage ratio, including the SLR, are the way to deal with that problem? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Victoria, we’ll have something to announce on that in coming days.  And I’m not going to expound upon your questions.  Why don’t you—why don’t you ask another question if you’d like to?  Because, because that one—I’m just going to say that we’ll have something in coming days. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Sure.  Okay.  Well, then I’ll ask about unemployment.  You know, there’s—the unemployment rate is—you all have projections for the U-6 rate, but you’ve also been, you know, really emphasizing the fact that that’s not the only thing that you all are looking at.  You’re also looking at labor force participation and things like that.  So are you all looking at ways of maybe adding to how you’re projecting the unemployment rate to the Summary of Economic Projections? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, let me say, as we say in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we look to a range of indicators on the labor market.  We never only looked at the unemployment rate, which is the only indicator of, of labor market outcomes that’s in the SEP.  We look at a very broad range.  You hear us talk all the time about participation; about employment to population, which is the combination of the two; about different measures of, of unemployment.  So it’s wages, it’s, it’s the job flows, it’s, you know, all of those things.  They go into an assessment—disparities of various groups.  All that goes into an assessment of maximum employment.  March 17, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL The, the—trying to incorporate all of that into the Summary of Economic Projections would not be practical.  You know, obviously, the thing that we do include is just the unemployment rate, and that’s a very insufficient statistic.  So—it, it doesn’t include a lot of other things that we—that we do look at.  And I, I wouldn’t want to say that we’re looking to include the other dozen things that we look at into the SEP.  But at time—from time to time, we do look at, at adding different things.  But I, I would just say the SEP is, it’s a summary.  It’s one device.  It’s not going to include all of the things that we look at.  I think you know the things that we look at—we, we talk about them all the time.  So we’re not actually looking actively at significantly broadening those indicators in the SEP right now. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. 

[SECTION]

CHRIS RUGABER.  Thank you.  Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the forecast overall.  You’re forecasting a very low unemployment rate next year and in 2023, you have inflation—or, the Fed overall is, in the SEP, forecasting inflation at or above 2 percent by 2023, yet no rate hike in any of this—in any of this forecast horizon.  So is this telling us that we could see a higher inflation rate than was projected?  Or do you not—as you’ve been talking about, is the unemployment rate insufficient?  Or what is this telling us about the Fed’s reaction function, that it seems you’re meeting the Fed’s dual mandate by 2023, yet, again, no rate hike expected? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess the first thing to say is that the, the SEP is not a Committee forecast.  It’s, it’s not something we sit around and debate and discuss and approve, and say, “This represents our, you know, our reaction function as a Committee.”  It’s a compilation of projections from different people.  And I—since we don’t debate it or discuss it, it would be hard for me to say why—exactly why each participant did what they were going to do.  March 17, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL So all I would say about this is that we’ve—we laid out what I think is very clear guidance on liftoff.  And it’s really three things:  labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of maximum employment—and, as I mentioned, we consider a wide range of indicators in assessing labor market conditions, not just the unemployment rate; inflation that has reached 2 percent, and not just on a transitory basis; and inflation that’s on track to run moderately above 2 percent for some time.  The first two of those three are very much data based; the third does have a little bit of a—of an element of expectations in it.  So we are very much determined to implement this guidance in a robust way.  It is the guidance that we chose carefully to implement our new framework.  And to meet these standards, we’ll need to see data, as I mentioned. So what does—what does this, this SEP really say?  It says that we’re committed to our framework and to the guidance we’ve provided to implement that framework.  We will wait until the requirements set forth in that guidance are clearly met before considering a change in our policy rate.  And the last thing I’ll say is this:  The state of the economy in two or three years is highly uncertain, and I wouldn’t want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate increase that far into the future.  So that’s how I would think about the, the SEP. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Paul Kiernan. 

[SECTION]

PAUL KIERNAN.  Thank you, Chairman Powell.  My question is twofold.  One, how high are you comfortable letting inflation rise?  There, there is some ambiguity in, in your new target, as you mentioned, “expectations driven.”  And, and do you think that that ambiguity might cause markets to price in a lower tolerance for inflation than the Fed actually has, thereby causing financial conditions to tighten prematurely?  Is that a concern?  Thanks.  March 17, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we’ve said we’d like to see inflation run moderately above 2 percent for some time.  And we’ve resisted, basically, generally, the temptation to try to quantify that.  Part of that just is, talking about inflation is one thing; actually having inflation run above 2 percent is the real thing.  So I—you know, over the years we’ve, we’ve talked about 2 percent inflation as a goal, but we haven’t achieved it.  So I, I would say we’d like to, you know, perform.  That’s what we’d really like to do, is to get inflation moderately above 2 percent. I don’t want to be too specific about what that means, because I think it’s hard to do that.  And we haven’t done it yet.  You know, when we’re actually above 2 percent, we can do that.  I—look, I, I would say this.  The fundamental change in, in our framework is that we, we’re not going to act preemptively based on forecasts for the most part.  And we’re going to wait to see actual data.  And I think it will take people time to, to adjust to that—and to adjust to that new practice.  And the only way we can really build the credibility of that is by doing it.  So that’s how I would think about that. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Matthew Boesler. 

[SECTION]

MATTHEW BOESLER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  This is Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News.  So there’s a widespread presumption at this point that the U.S. will reach herd immunity sometime this year.  And all along, you’ve said that the path of the economy is going to be determined by the course of the virus.  I’m curious, based on the projections that you released today that show unemployment will still be above estimates of maximum employment through the end of next year and perhaps sometime into 2023, do you think policymakers need to be doing more here to sort of align the herd immunity and full employment timelines, if you will?  Thank you.  March 17, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, on, on herd immunity, I, I’m really going to leave that question to the experts.  We don’t control that.  We’re not responsible for defining it.  And we’ll, we’ll leave that whole discussion to the experts.  I mean, we’re—what we’re focused on is, is the part that we control, which is the support that we provide to the economy.  And there we’ve provided very clear guidance.  And in the case of asset purchases, it’s at their current level until we make substantial further progress.  There is an element of judgment in that, and we’ll, we’ll—therefore, we’ll supply clear communication well in advance of, of actually tapering, and we just went through, you know, the, the criteria for raising interest rates.  They’re very specific.  And, you know, we’re, we’re very much committed to having them fulfilled robustly. I, I would agree with you that the, the path of the virus continues to be very important.  We, we have these, you know, new strains with—which, which can be quite virulent.  And we’re not actually done yet.  And I, I—we’re clearly on a good path with, with cases coming down, as I mentioned, but we’re not done.  And I’d hate to see us take our eye off the ball before we actually finish the job.  So that’s how I would look at that. 

[SECTION]

MATTHEW BOESLER.  If I could just briefly follow up, how do you see sort of the disconnect in terms of an economy that is expected to be widely reopened this year but full employment taking longer to achieve?  Is it, is it the case that factors related to the virus will still be with us over the coming years?  Is that how to interpret the forecasts? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I think there’s some of that.  Sure, there’ll be some of that.  There will still be some social distancing.  People may be, for example, going into spaces that, that, you know, that involve close contact with others.  Some people will do that right away.  Others will hold back.  And so I think there’ll—there’ll be some of that.  March 17, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL In addition, though, remember, there are—there are 10 million people—in the range of 10 million people who need to get back to work.  And it’s going to take some time for that to happen.  You know, it can—it can happen maybe, maybe more quickly than it has in the past, because it involves the reopening of a sector of the economy, as opposed to stimulating aggregate demand and waiting for that to produce job demand for workers.  This could be a different sort of a process.  And it could be quicker.  We don’t know that.  But it’s, it’s just a lot of people who have—who need to get back to work.  And it’s not going to happen overnight.  It would be—it’s going to take some time.  No matter how well the economy performs, unemployment will take quite a time to go—to go down, and so will participation.  So that’s all I can say.  I think the faster the better; we’d love to see it come sooner rather than later.  We’d welcome nothing more than that.  But, realistically, given the numbers, it’s going to take some time. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you, Steve Liesman. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, thank you.  I wonder if you could—kind of a three-parter here, but all related.  Would you comment on the current level of the 10-year yield and some other long rates out there, whether or not you think they would have a negative effect on the economy?  And, if not, is there a level that would give you concern?  And, finally, the third part:  Other central bankers have expressed concern about what’s happened to yields in their countries and even some taken action, but not you.  Could you give us your general idea or orientation towards the idea of, of coming into the market and affecting a particular tenor of the bond market?  Do—do you like that idea?  Do you not like it?  Is it at the top of your toolbox, or is it something that you think is at the bottom of the toolbox?  March 17, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So we monitor a broad range of financial conditions, and we’re always attentive to market developments, of course.  We’re still a long way from our goals, and it’s important that financial conditions do remain accommodative to support the achievement of those goals.  And if you look at various indexes of financial conditions, what you’ll see is that they generally do show financial conditions overall to be highly accommodative.  And that is appropriate.  So that’s, that’s how we look at it. I would add, as I’ve said, I would be concerned by disorderly conditions in markets or by a persistent tightening of financial conditions that threaten the achievement of our goals.  We think the stance of our—of monetary policy remains appropriate.  Our guidance on the federal funds rate and on asset purchases is providing strong support for the economy.  And we’re committed to maintaining that patiently accommodative stance until the job is well and truly done. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Could, could you give us an idea of how you sort of feel about that tool, of being able to come into a particular part of the market and either operating—doing an Operation Twist or something like that?  Is that something you feel to be the top of your toolbox or something that you don’t really prefer? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we—the tools we have are the tools we have.  What I’m telling you is that the stance of monetary policy we have today, we believe, is appropriate.  We think that our asset purchases in their current form—which is to say, you know, across the curve, $80 billion in Treasuries, $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities on net—we think that that’s, that’s the right place for our asset purchases.  Now, we can—we can change them, of course, in, in a number of different dimensions should we deem that that’s appropriate.  But, for now, we think that our policy stance on that is appropriate.  March 17, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Rachel Siegel. 

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks very much for taking my question.  You’ve spoken about the pandemic’s disproportionate toll on Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and other groups in the labor market.  And I’m curious if you can speak to specific indicators that the Fed will be using to measure job gains for groups that have persistently higher rates of unemployment compared to white Americans.  And, relatedly, since you’ve described vaccines as key to the economic recovery, is the Fed concerned about lower vaccination rates in communities of color?  And what barriers do you think exist there?  Thanks very much. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, which measures.  So we, we do monitor and communicate very regularly about different labor market—disparities in the labor market, let’s say.  So the African American unemployment rate is substantially elevated, and so is the Hispanic unemployment rate.  So we look at those and we see those as, you know—it’s, it’s slack in the labor market.  It’s, it’s sad to see, because those disparities had really come down to record lows since we started keeping the data that way.  As recently as a year ago, February of last year, we had those, those disparities quite low.  What happens in a downturn, though, is they move up at twice the speed of white unemployment.  So we monitor those things. We—our tools, of course, affect unemployment generally, but we’re going to look at those as, as a form of slack in the labor market and hope that, you know, that there’s progress there.  And, and this particular downturn, of course, was just a direct hit on, on a part of the economy that employs many minorities and lower-paid workers.  The public-facing workers in the service industries in many cases don’t have a lot of financial assets, they’re not tremendously well paid, they might have other jobs, and things like that.  So this was a direct hit on that part of  March 17, 2021  the economy.  And it’s the slowest part of the economy to recover.  So, you know, we’d like to Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL see those people continue to get supported, you know, as we—as the broader economy recovers, which, which it’s very much doing now. In terms of disparate levels of vaccination, that’s—those are facts and unfortunate facts.  They’re really not something we, we have within our policy toolkit to address.  But it is—it is true, though, that the data we have suggests that there are—there are significant disparities between different ethnic groups and—you know, but that’s, that’s not for us.  That’s for fiscal authorities and the government more generally to, to work on. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Jeanna Smialek. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hey, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the fiscal policy support that has come down the line affecting the economy’s potential in the longer term, just in the sense that you’ve talked a lot about the potential for labor market scarring and how that might weigh on our, sort of, future prospects.  And I wonder whether you see that sort of working in reverse.  You know, if we put people back into the labor market more quickly, does that improve our chances? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I do think that fiscal policy overall will have really helped us to avoid much of the scarring that we were very, very concerned about at the beginning.  And I think that’s just the size and the speed with which Congress has delivered—you know, with the 

[SECTION]

CARES Act and since then, has—is going to wind up very much accelerating the return to full employment.  It’s going to make a huge difference in people’s lives.  And it has already. As I mentioned in my remarks—opening remarks, the recovery has been faster than we expected.  Part of that just is, it’s very hard to predict, given we’ve never seen an event like this.  But part of it is just the strength of the fiscal response, which I think will, will look good over the  March 17, 2021  years.  Longer term, you know, to, to really—that’s—the first part of it is about avoiding Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL scarring, and I think we’ve not avoided all of the scarring, but we’ve probably avoided the worst cases there.  And, and I hope we keep at it, and we will keep at it with our policies, of course, to do whatever we can to make sure that’s—that continues. Longer term though, what it takes to drive productive capacity per capita or per hour worked, to raise living standards over time, is investment:  investment in people’s skills and aptitudes, investment in plant and equipment, investment in software.  It takes a lot of investment to, to support a more productive economy and raise living standards.  And that’s—you know, that hasn’t been the principal focus with these measures—our measures, certainly.  And we don’t have those tools.  But what Congress has been doing has mainly been replacing lost income and beginning to, you know, support people as the economy returns to normal.  But there should be a focus on—a longer-term focus, I think, would be healthy on, on the investment front. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  James Politi. 

[SECTION]

JAMES POLITI.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  I wanted to ask a question about the euro zone.  While the outlook for the U.S. economy has much improved, progress in the euro zone has been far less encouraging.  And it’s showing signs of serious weakness due, due to the slower vaccination rollout and renewed lockdowns and restrictions.  How worried are you about transatlantic economic divergence and the possibility that, that trouble in the euro zone and weakness in the euro zone could, could drag down the U.S. recovery as it did, in a way, in the aftermath of the financial crisis? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You’re right that the pace of the recovery is that we’re having diverging recoveries here, as we did after the last crisis.  And in this case, as well as the other one, the U.S.’s recovery is, is leading the global recovery.  And, you know, we conduct policy,  March 17, 2021  of course, here.  Our, our focus is on—our, you know—our, our objectives are domestic ones.  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL It’s, it’s maximum employment and price stability here in the United States.  We monitor developments abroad, and we know—because they know we know that they can—those can affect our outcomes.  So I think U.S. demand—very strong U.S. demand, if, if—as the economy improves is going to support global activity as well over time.  That, that’ll be through imports.  And, you know, when the U.S. economy is strong, that strength tends to be—tends to support global, global activity as well.  So that’s one thing. I don’t—I don’t worry in the near term.  I mean, I’d love to see Europe growing faster.  I’d love to see the vaccine rollout going more smoothly.  But I don’t worry too much about us in the near term, because we’re, we’re on a very good track.  Very strong fiscal support coming, now vaccination going quickly, and cases coming down.  I think we’re—I think we’re in a good place.  It’s all ahead of us, but the data should, should get stronger fairly quickly here and remain strong for some time here. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Hannah Lang. 

[SECTION]

HANNAH LANG.  Hi, thanks so much for taking our questions.  I wanted to ask if the Fed is planning on extending the same restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases—I’m sorry, share repurchases that are currently in place into the second quarter, and if you’re considering at all the scenario analysis and midcycle stress tests that were in place last year, this year.  And, kind of, what would make you consider doing something like that again? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we haven’t made a decision on that.  We’re a couple weeks away from announcing that decision.  I, I won’t foreshadow it here today.  I will say, we’re going to continue our data-driven approach.  You know that we restricted buybacks and dividends, so the firms are preserving capital.  Through 2020, the banks actually increased their level of capital  March 17, 2021  and their level of reserves.  And the December stress tests showed that banks are strong and well Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL capitalized under our hypothetical recessions that we—that we used in December, which were quite stringent. We’re right in the middle of our 2021 stress tests, and we’ll release those results before the end of June.  And that layers, you know, very significant additional stress on top of the stress the banks have already absorbed over the past year, with the unemployment rate going to 11 percent and stock prices falling more than 50 percent.  So—but all of that, you know, the results of the stress tests and the decision on distributions—all of that is to come fairly soon, as I mentioned. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Edward Lawrence. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thanks, Chair Powell, for taking these questions.  You laid out the standards to lift off.  And back in June of 2020, you said, you know, you’re not even thinking about thinking about raising rates.  But I see seven members seeing liftoff in 2023 and 4 next year.  How, how much debate—and how can you characterize that conversation—has there been about moving off the lower bound earlier than signaled? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, you know, it all depends.  We’ve set out very clear criteria for liftoff, right, where we’ve said we want to see labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of, of maximum employment.  And that doesn’t just mean unemployment, it means a much broader set of criteria.  We want inflation at 2 percent, and not on a transitory basis.  And we want inflation on track to be moderately—to run moderately above 2 percent for some time.  Those are the three conditions.  Everybody on the Committee agrees to that, right? So it comes down to, what’s your projection for the economy?  If you want to—if you want to—you know, people will have a range of, of assessments for how good the economy is  March 17, 2021  going to be.  And, you know, we, we don’t—I would say that we’re in a relatively highly Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL uncertain situation.  If you look at the uncertainty, people, people on the Committee broadly say that uncertainty about the forecast is, is very high compared to the normal level.  We haven’t come out of a pandemic before.  We haven’t had this kind of fiscal support before, totaling it all up.  So you’re going to have different perspectives from Committee participants about how fast growth will be, how fast the labor market will heal, or how fast—sorry, inflation will move up.  And those things are going to dictate where people write down an estimate of liftoff. Of course, this isn’t a decision to lift off now.  We’ll make that decision then.  But it’s an estimate based on—based on assumptions about growth.  And it’s, it’s meant to be a tool to generally show the public how, how our objective function works, how we think about the future.  It isn’t meant to actually pin down a time when we might or might not lift off.  We—you know, we’re not going to make that decision for some time.  The chances are that the economy in that time and place will be very different from the one we think it’ll be. So I—sometimes with the dots, I have to be sure to point out that they—they’re not a Committee forecast.  And you know this, but it’s—they’re not a Committee forecast.  It’s just compiling these projections, really, of individual people.  We think it serves a useful purpose.  It’s not meant to, to actually be a promise or even a prediction of when the Committee will act.  That will be very much dependent on economic outcomes, which are highly uncertain. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Brian Cheung. 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hey there, Chairman Powell.  I wanted to elaborate a little bit on your commentary about the fiscal stimulus.  So it sounds like you, I guess, see the case for even answered to Jeanna’s question.  So we just had $1.9 trillion dollars in spending.  So where do  March 17, 2021  you see the fiscal space right now?  Do you still, I guess, maybe see the country in a place right Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL now where it wouldn’t be a concern if there were to be more spending at this time? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, Brian, it’s not up to us to decide what, what Congress should spend money on or when.  I was answering Jeanna’s question, which really was, how do we assure lack of damage to—scarring, for example, or lack of damage to the productive capacity of the economy?  And I think what’s happened so far has done a pretty good job of that.  But, really, I wanted to make the longer-run point that if—to work on the productivity—on productivity over longer periods, that is—that is—comes down to a number of things.  But one of those things is investment:  investment in people, in their skills, education, aptitude, all of those things. I’m not in any way suggesting that that’s something Congress should work on right now.  Or that, you know, that’s just not my—that’s not our job.  I’m just saying, that, that is what fiscal policy can do that, really, monetary policy can’t do—is, is invest in the future productive capacity of the economy, raise potential growth.  Those things are completely tools that Congress has.  And, again, I wasn’t making a comment at all on the current fiscal setting. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Next to Michael Derby. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Thank you for taking my question.  I just wanted to get your—an updated view on your sense of your view on financial stability risks and whether or not you see any pockets of excess out in financial markets that concern you, either, you know, specifically to that, that area of the market or as in terms of, like, the threat that it could pose to—propose to the overall economy. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So, as you know, financial stability for us is, is a framework.  It’s not one thing.  It’s not a particular market or a particular asset or anything like that.  It’s a  March 17, 2021  framework that we, we have.  We report on it semiannually, the Board gets a report on it Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL quarterly, and we monitor every day.  And it has—it has four pillars, and those are four key vulnerabilities:  asset valuations, debt owed by businesses and households, funding risk, and leverage among financial institutions.  Those four things.  And I’ll just quickly touch on them. So if you look at asset valuations, you can say that by some measures, some asset valuations are elevated compared to history.  I think that’s clear.  In terms of households and businesses, households entered the, the crisis in very good shape by historical standards.  Leverage in the household sector had been just kind of gradually moving down and down and down since the—since the financial crisis.  Now, there was—there was some negative effects on that, people lost their jobs and that sort of thing, but they’ve also gotten a lot of support now.  So the damage hasn’t been as, as bad as we thought.  Businesses, by the same token, had a high debt load coming in.  And—but—and many saw their revenues decline.  But there’s—they’ve done so much financing, and there’s a lot of cash on their balance sheet.  So nothing in those two sectors really jumps out as really troubling. Short term—I mentioned funding risk as the—as the last one.  So we saw, again, in this crisis, breakdowns in parts of the short-term funding markets—came under a tremendous amount of stress.  And they’ve been quiet since the spring.  And, you know, we shut down our facilities and all of that.  But we, we don’t—we don’t feel like we can let the moment pass without just saying again that we—that those—some aspects of the short-term funding markets and, more broadly, nonbank financial intermediation didn’t hold up so well under great stress—under tremendous stress.  And we need to go back and look at that.  So a very high priority for us as regulators and supervisors is going to be to go back—and this, this will involve all the other regulatory agencies; it does involve all of them as well—and see if we can strengthen those  March 17, 2021  things.  So that’s, that’s a—sort of a broader, detailed look. Chair Powell’s Press Conference 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Michael McKee. FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, can you help me understand something about the, the SEP and your forecasts?  The inflation that you’re talking about for this year, you say, is “transitory.”  Then, by 2023, you’re back down to 2.1 percent.  There’s no forecast for a rate increase for 2023.  If you get to 3½ percent unemployment but inflation is only at 2 or 2.1 percent, are you willing to leave rates at zero going forward from there—or, roughly zero going forward from there?  In other words, could we be in a Japan-like situation where rates just stay low because inflation does? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, again, I wouldn’t read too much into, into the, the March 2021 members.  They’re all making different assessments.  They, they have different forecasts, economic forecasts.  Some have more optimistic ones, some less optimistic.  And they’re—also remember that the SEP doesn’t actually include all the things that go into maximum employment.  Right?  It’s, it’s only—it only includes unemployment. So I, I would just say, we’ve set out clear guidance.  The—the message from the SEP that I would like to leave with people is, we set out clear guidance.  I mentioned what it was.  It’s inflation up to—no, sorry, it’s, it’s labor market conditions consistent with our estimates of maximum employment—and that’s not just unemployment, it’s all the other indicators, but, overall, totaling up to maximum employment; it’s inflation at 2 percent, and not on a transient basis; and inflation on track to exceed 2 percent for—moderately for some time.  Those are the criteria.  We’re committed to robustly implementing that guidance.  March 17, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL And that’s what this—that’s what this says.  That’s really all it says.  We’re going to wait until those requirements are met.  And, again, you know, the, the state of the economy in two or three years is highly uncertain.  And I wouldn’t want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate increase that far into the future. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  If I could follow up, I’m just wondering—before 2019, I would say you were focused on the problems with having interest rates too low.  Now are you saying we’re willing to live with it until we reach these goals even if you get—meet your goal on maximum employment? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So what I would say is, we’re committed to giving the economy the support that it needs to return as quickly as possible to a state of maximum employment and price stability.  And, you know, to the extent having rates low and support for monetary policy broadly, to the extent that raises other questions, we think it’s absolutely essential to maintain the strength and stability of the—of the broader financial system and to carefully monitor financial stability questions if that’s what you’re getting at.  You know, we, we do that.  We will—we monitor them very carefully. I, I would point out that, over the long expansion—the longest in U.S. history, 10 years and 8 months—rates were very low for—they were at zero for, you know, 7 years and then—and then never got above, you know, 2.4 percent, roughly.  During that, we didn’t see, actually, excess buildup of debt.  We didn’t see asset prices form into bubbles that would threaten the progress of the economy.  We didn’t see the things you—we didn’t see a housing bubble.  You know, the things that have tended to really hurt an economy and have in recent history hurt the U.S., we didn’t see them build up despite very low rates.  Part of that just is that you’re in a low-rate environment, you’re in a much lower rate environment, and the connection between low  March 17, 2021  rates and the kind of financial instability issues is just not as tight as people think it is. Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL That’s not to say we ignore it.  We don’t ignore it.  We, we watch it very carefully.  And we don’t think—we think there is a connection.  We say there is, but it’s not quite so clear.  We actually monitor financial conditions very, very broadly and carefully.  And we didn’t do that before the Global Financial Crisis 12 years ago.  Now we do.  And we’ve also, you know, put a lot of time and effort into strengthening the large financial institutions that form the core of our financial system—are much stronger, much more resilient.  That’s true of the banks.  I think it’s true of the CCPs.  We want it to be true of, of other nonbank financial intermediation, markets, and, and institutions. So I think that’s, that’s—you know, monetary policy should be, to me, for, for achieving our macroeconomic aims.  Financial regulatory policy and supervision should be for strengthening the financial system so that it is strong and robust and can withstand the kinds of things that it couldn’t, frankly—and we learned that in 2008, ’09, ’10.  This time around, the regulated part of the financial system held up very well.  We, we found some other areas that need strengthening, and that’s what we’re working on now.

ANNEKEN TAPPE.  Thanks for taking my question.  Chairman Powell, could you talk to us a little bit about the relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in, in inflation?  Does the former offset the latter to some degree?

[SECTION]

ANNEKEN TAPPE.  Okay, great.  I was asking if you could talk to us a little bit about the relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in inflation.  I’m wondering whether the former offsets the latter and to which degree you guys are 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You’re asking about the relationship between unemployment and monitoring this. inflation?  Is that—is that the question? 

[SECTION]

ANNEKEN TAPPE.  Yes, exactly. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Okay. 

[SECTION]

ANNEKEN TAPPE.  If they offset each other—the persistent pandemic unemployment. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, I think I’m hearing you correctly.  So I would say a couple things.  There was a time when there was a tight connection between unemployment and inflation.  That time is long gone.  We had extremely low unemployment in, in—not extremely low.  We had low unemployment in 2018 and ’19 and the beginning of ’20 without having troubling inflation at all.  We were at 3.5 percent.  We were bouncing around with unemployment 3.5 percent to 4 percent.  And it wasn’t just unemployment.  Participation was high, wages were moving up.  It was a very healthy thing.  And we didn’t see price inflation move up. There is a relationship between wage inflation and unemployment.  But that has not—what, what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather than raising prices.  And that seems to be a feature of late-cycle behavior.  So we’re, we’re not—when, when we—when we seek to achieve low unemployment, high levels of employment, which is our mandate, you know, we think we have the freedom to do that based on the data without worrying too much about inflation.  March 17, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Going to Greg Robb. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  I wanted to follow up a little bit.  I, I understand what you’re saying about the dot plot and, and the message you’re trying to send with the dot plot.  But does the same apply for the taper tantrum?  You’ve said that it’s going to take “some time” to get some fundamental progress on your goals, but it seems like “some time” could now be any time. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we’ve said “substantial further progress.”  Now, if you go back, slowed very sharply.  So you had an average of 29,000 jobs per month.  If you go back and look at the, the level of job creation before that, it was very, very high—very high.  So we weren’t making any progress on the labor market from November through January.  February, we saw a nice—a nice pickup, a good jobs report—379,465 private sector.  So that’s good.  It can go so much higher, though. And, and, you know, it would be nice to see—to really make faster progress that’s different from substantial progress, we’d like to see it be, be higher than that.  And I think it will be.  That’s—the expectation is, you’ll see now, I think, really strong job creation return—not as high as it was in the very early days of the recovery, the reopening of the economy, but, nonetheless, very strong. Okay.  So what, what I’m saying is, to achieve substantial progress from where we are, having had three months of, of very little progress, is going to take some time.  And it’s—we don’t want to get into—I don’t want to get into trying to put a pin on the calendar someplace, because it’s going to be data dependent.  When we see—when we see ourselves on track to make substantial further progress, we’re going to—we’re going to say so.  We understand fully that  March 17, 2021  that test is one that involves judgment. Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL If you remember, during the Global Financial Crisis recovery, we said quantitative easing, number three, was—the test was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor the labor market.  It meant we would communicate when we thought we had that.  This is just like that, in a way.  What we’re saying is, substantial further progress toward our goals.  We’ll tell people when we think—until we—until we say—until we give a signal, you can assume we’re not there yet.  And as we approach it, well in advance—well in advance—we will give a signal that, yes, we’re on a path to, to possibly achieve that, to consider tapering. So that’s, that’s how we’re planning to handle it.  It’s not different, really, from, from QE3.  And I think we’ve learned—what we’ve learned from the experience of these last dozen years is to communicate very carefully, very clearly, well in advance, and then follow through with, with your communications.  In this case, it’s, it’s an outcome-based set of guidance, as our rate guidance is, and it’s going to depend on the progress of the economy.  That’s why it’s not appropriate to start pointing at dates yet. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Don Lee, L.A. Times. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Hi, Chair Powell.  As you know, households, households are sitting on a lot of excess savings.  And I wonder if, combined with that, you have an unleashing of, you know, pent-up demand.  How much do you think that would affect—that would affect inflation?  And would you expect that to be transitory? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We, you know, we and everyone who’s forecasting these—what, what we’re all doing is, we are looking at the—at the amount of savings.  We’re looking at—you  March 17, 2021  know, we have reasonably good data on that.  And we’re looking at the government transfers Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL that’ll be made as part of the various laws.  And we’re trying to make an assessment on what will be the tendency of people to spend that money, the marginal propensity to consume.  And from that, you can develop an estimate of the impact on spending, on growth, on hiring, and, ultimately, on inflation.  So that’s, that’s what we’re all doing. And we have, you know, we have—we can look at history, and we can make estimates, and those are all very transparent and public.  And you can compare one to the other.  And, of course, we’ve all—we’ve all done that.  And I think we’ve made very conservative assumptions and sensible mainstream assumptions at each step of that process.  And what, what it comes down to is what I said before, which is, there very likely will be a step-up in inflation as March and April of last year drop out of the 12-month window, because they were very low inflation numbers.  That’s a—that’ll be a fairly significant pop in inflation.  It’ll wear off quickly, though, because it—just the way the numbers are calculated. Past that, as the economy reopens, people will start spending more, and then, you know, you can only go out to dinner once per night, but a lot of people can go out to dinner.  And so—and they’re not doing that now.  They’re not going to restaurants, not going to theaters.  That part of the economy—and travel and hotels—that part of the economy is, is really not functioning at, at full capacity, right?  But as that happens, people can start to spend.  It’s also—wouldn’t be surprising if—and you’re seeing this now, particularly in the goods economy—there’ll be bottlenecks.  They won’t be—they won’t be able to service all of the demand maybe, maybe for a period.  So those things could lead to—and we’ve, we’ve modeled that.  Other people have too.  We’ve—and what we see is relatively modest increases in inflation.  So—but those are not permanent things.  March 17, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL You know, what’ll, what’ll happen is—the supply side—the supply side in the United States is very dynamic.  People start businesses, they, they reopen restaurants, you know, the airlines are, will be flying again, all of those things will happen.  And so it’ll turn out to be a one—a one-time sort of bulge in, in prices, but it won’t change inflation going forward, because inflation expectations are strongly anchored around 2 percent.  We know that inflation dynamics do evolve over time.  And there was a time when, when inflation went up, it would stay up.  And, and that time is not now.  That hasn’t been the case for some decades.  And we think it won’t—it won’t—we won’t suddenly change to another regime. These things tend to change over time.  And they tend to—tend to change when the central bank doesn’t understand that having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent is the key to it all.  The, the—having them anchored at 2 percent is what gives us the ability to push hard when the economy’s really weak.  If we saw inflation expectations moving materially above 2 percent, of course, we would conduct policy in a way that would, would make sure that that didn’t happen.  We’re committed to having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent, not materially above or below 2 percent. So that’s—I think if you—if you look at the savings, look at all of that, model it, that’s, that’s kind of what comes out of our assessment.  There are different possibilities.  I think it’s, it’s a relatively unusual—very unusual situation to have all these savings and this, this amount of fiscal support and monetary policy support.  Nonetheless, that, that is our most likely case.  And you know, as the—as the data come in and the economy performs, we’ll of course adjust.  Our outcome-based guidance will immediately adapt, we think, to meet whatever the actual path of the economy is. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Scott Horsley for the last question.  March 17, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thanks, Chairman Powell.  My question is about those supply chain bottlenecks, especially on the goods side.  Are they getting better, or are they getting worse?  We saw they were sort of a drag on the industrial production numbers we—that came out yesterday.  And what do you expect them to do to prices in, in—just in the short run? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I have to say, I think it’s impossible to say, frankly, with any confidence, but I, I would expect it’s very possible—let’s put it that way—that you will see bottlenecks emerge and then clear over time.  And you’ll probably see that over a period of time, because, you know, really, the, the strong data are ahead of us.  You know, you’re, you’re—right now the, the checks are going out just, just now.  And that’ll, that’ll add to spending.  COVID cases are coming down.  Vaccination is moving, now, quickly.  You know, the, the really strong economic data is coming.  It should be coming, assuming we stay on this track.  And that’s when you’ll really know where, where the bottlenecks are. But you can see, though, that they’re not—these are not permanent.  It’s not like the supply side will be unable to adapt to these things.  It will—the market will clear.  It just may take some time.  And, and some of the answer to that may be price.  In many cases, it won’t be price.  You’ll see that people are reluctant to raise prices.  You know, it’s a little bit the story about, you know, the wage—the wage Phillips curve does show that as unemployment goes down, wages move up.  But companies choose not to try to, to pass that, that price increase along to their customers.  So you’ll see a lot of that here too, I think.  Anyway, we’ll, we’ll see.  But that’s, that’s my basic, basic sense.  Thank you very much. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
43,2021-04-28,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability. Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable asset purchases.  These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete. Widespread vaccinations, along with unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also providing strong support to the recovery.  Since the beginning of the year, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened.  Household spending on goods has risen robustly.  The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing production have also increased.  Spending on services has also picked up, including at restaurants and bars.  More generally, the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement.  While the recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, it remains uneven and far from complete. The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and the measures undertaken to control its spread.  Since March, progress on vaccinations has limited the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.  While the level of new cases remains concerning, especially as it reflects the spread of more infectious strains of the virus, continued vaccinations should allow for a return to more normal economic conditions later this year.  In the  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL meantime, continued observance of public health and safety guidance will help us reach that goal as soon as possible. As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve.  Employment rose 916,000 in March, as the leisure and hospitality sector posted a notable gain for the second consecutive month.  Nonetheless, employment in this sector is still more than 3 million below its level at the onset of the pandemic.  For the economy as a whole, payroll employment is 8.4 million below its pre-pandemic level.  The unemployment rate remained elevated at 6 percent in March, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemic levels. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit.  In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics.  The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. Readings on inflation have increased and are likely to rise somewhat further before moderating.  In the near term, 12-month measures of PCE inflation are expected to move above 2 percent as the very low readings from early in the pandemic fall out of the calculation and past increases in oil prices pass through to consumer energy prices.  Beyond these effects, we are also likely to see upward pressure on prices from the rebound in spending as the economy continues to reopen, particularly if supply bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term.  However, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory effects on inflation.  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  As we say in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal.  Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent. As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.  We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.  With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.  I would note that a transitory rise in inflation above 2 percent this year would not meet this standard. In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  The increase in our balance sheet since March 2020 has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy.  The economy is a long way from our goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved.  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL Our guidance for interest rates and asset purchases ties the path of the federal funds rate and the size of the balance sheet to our employment and inflation goals.  This outcome-based guidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.

[SECTION]

PAUL KIERNAN.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Thanks for doing this.  I guess, since I’m first, I’ll go ahead and re-up Howard’s question from the last press conference:  Is it time to start talking about talking about tapering yet?  Have you and your colleagues had any conversations to this effect?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  So, no, it is not time yet.  We’ve said that we would let the public know when it is time to have that conversation, and we said we’d do that well in advance of any actual decision to taper our asset purchases, and we will do so.  In the meantime, we’ll be monitoring progress toward our goals.  We first articulated this “substantial further progress” test at our December meeting.  Economic activity and hiring have just recently picked up after slowing over the winter.  And it will take some time before we see substantial further progress.

PAUL KIERNAN.  Thank you.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Jonnelle at Reuters. April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

JONNELLE MARTE.  Okay.  Hi.  Thank you so much.  My question is about what’s going on with the virus, and what if we don’t reach a level of herd immunity, per se.  So, in your scenario, thinking about the outlook and the economy, do you have some model where you might start to still normalize policy even if there’s like a baseline of infection still going on?  Or how can you, you know, talk about how you’re weighing those things? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, so we have to leave questions about herd immunity and what that looks like to the health experts, but, but I would certainly say that what matters the most to the economic recovery continues to be controlling the virus.  The economy can’t fully recover until people are confident that it’s safe to resume activities involving crowds of people.  There feel really comfortable going back to their old jobs, for example, and there, there may be parts of the economy that will—that just won’t be able to, to really fully reengage until the pandemic is But, you know, we’ve articulated particular guidance for tapering our asset purchases and for lifting off and raising interest rates.  So for, for asset purchases, we’ve said that we would continue at the current pace of asset purchases until we see substantial further progress toward our goals.  So—and that is, that is what it is, substantial further progress.  For interest rates, as I—as I said a moment ago, we want to see labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, we want to see inflation at 2 percent, and we want to see it on track to exceed 2 percent.  So those are our tests.  We don’t have an independent test to do with the virus.  I will say, though, as I—as I started with, you know, the, the path of the virus is going to have an effect on our ability to achieve both of those tests. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Great.  Thank you.  Jeanna.  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that test for raising interest rates that you just elaborated.  You’ve obviously made it very clear that you want to see improvements in the real economy and the real data and not in just sort of expectations data before making that move.  But I guess I wonder what happens if inflation expectations were to move up before you see some sort of return to full employment.  You know, it seems like a lot of sort of the stability in inflation has been tied to the fact that those have been so low and stable, and I guess I wonder how, how your reaction would be—sort of how your reaction to that is, is—how you’re thinking about that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So it seems unlikely, frankly, that we would see inflation moving up in a persistent way that would actually move inflation expectations up while there was still significant slack in the labor market.  I won’t say that it’s impossible, but it, it seems—it seems unlikely.  It’s much more likely that we would—having achieved maximum-employment conditions—we’d also be seeing 2 percent inflation and be on track to see inflation moving above 2 percent.  They tend to move together.  So that’s not to say inflation won’t—might not move up, but for inflation to move up in a persistent way that, that really starts to move inflation expectations up, that would have to—that would take some time.  And you would think that, that it would be quite likely that, that we’d be in very strong labor markets for that to be happening. If it—if that actually were to happen, though, there is a—there’s a paragraph in the—in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy which says that when the two goals are somewhat in conflict, we weigh various factors, including the, the time it would take to get back and [so] forth.  So we do—it doesn’t really tell you what to do, but it tells you that we will weigh those two factors and how far we are away from them and how long it would take to reach them were we to reach that sort of pretty unlikely state.  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Steve Liesman. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, I want to follow up on Jonnelle’s question, and I wonder if you can help us understand better your thinking about how COVID infection rates and the virus calibrate with monetary policy.  As you recall, we had a major resurgence in the virus last fall.  And I’m wondering, would you need to be assured that there wasn’t such a resurgence coming before you began—I mean, for lack of a better term—thinking about thinking about tapering?  And what kind of comfort level would you need?  Would it be something that would be declared from the CDC or the, or the World Health Organization—for example, downgrading the virus from a pandemic—before you have the comfort level to reverse course on policy?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  We, we really have—just articulated the goals that I’ve—that I’ve just mentioned a couple of times, which is substantial further progress toward our goals before we taper.  Now, that’s very likely—for us to achieve that, it’s very likely going to be the case that we’ve also made really significant progress on controlling the virus through vaccination and, and other—it, it—you know, those two things should more or less coexist. We haven’t articulated a separate test for a state of the virus that we’d like to achieve because we’re not—you know, we’re not experts in that area.  We’re, we’re really focused on the economic outcomes, and, again, my, my guess is that we—it’s very likely, it seems to me, that for us to achieve the economic outcomes, we would need to taper or to raise interest rates.  We would also have to have made very substantial progress in getting the virus under control—not, not necessarily fully under control.  There is a, a possibility, of course, that we will, will have ongoing outbreaks over the summer and various regional outbreaks and potentially next winter  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL as well.  But we’ll be looking for substantial progress toward our goal—substantial further progress toward our goals as we think about tapering asset purchases.

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Victoria. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I wanted to ask, you’ve talked a lot during this crisis about the need to have a lot of help from fiscal policy and monetary policy to make sure that there’s not long-term scarring in the economy.  And I was just wondering, you know, given all of the policies that have been put in place, do you expect there to still be some long-term scarring?  And, if so, you know, what are you most worried about?  Where are you most worried about that showing up? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I would say that we were very worried about scarring, both in the labor market from people being out of—out of the labor market for an extended period of time.  The evidence is clear that it becomes much more difficult if you’re out for a long time to get back in and get back to the life that you had.  Same thing with these small businesses, many of which are the work of generations.  Were we going to wipe out many of those unnecessarily?  That was a big concern. I would say that, so far, you know, here we are in late April of 2021.  We haven’t experienced that level of scarring either in the labor market or among smaller businesses.  So we’re not living that, that downside case that we were very concerned about a year ago.  Notwithstanding that, we’re a long way from full employment.  We’re—you know, payroll jobs are 8.4 million below where they were in February of 2020.  We’ve got a long ways to go.  And also, it’s going to be a different economy.  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL So we’ve been hearing a lot from companies that they are—they’ve been looking at deploying better technology and perhaps fewer people, including in some of the service industries that have been employing a lot of people.  You know, it, it may well be—it seems quite likely that a number of the people who, who had those service-sector jobs will struggle to find the same job and may need time to find work and get back to the working life they had.  These were people who were working in February of 2020.  They clearly want to work.  So those people are going to need—they’re going to need help. And so, while I would say we haven’t seen really highly elevated levels of unemployment for—you know, up in the teens that we thought we might have for an extended period of time, we’ve still got a lot of people who are out to—out of work.  We want to get them back to work as quickly as possible, and that’s really one of the things we’re trying to achieve with our policy. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Rachel Siegel. 

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions.  The housing market in many American cities is seeing booming prices, bidding wars, and all-cash offers well above asking price.  And this is happening at the same time that housing is becoming much more expensive for lower-income Americans and people who are still struggling from the pandemic.  Do you have concerns that there are localized housing bubbles or that there’s the potential for that, and what is the Fed doing to monitor or address this?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we do monitor the housing market very carefully, of course.  And I would say that, before the pandemic, it’s a very different housing market than it was before the Global Financial Crisis.  And one of the main differences was that households were in very good  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL shape financially compared to where they were.  In addition, most people who got mortgages were people with pretty high credit scores.  There wasn’t the subprime—you know, low-doc, no-doc lending practices were not there.  So we don’t have that kind of thing where we have a housing bubble where people are overlevered and owning a lot of houses. There’s no question, though, that housing prices are going up, and so we’re watching that carefully.  It’s, it’s partly because there’s, there’s clearly strong demand, and there’s just not a lot of supply right now.  So builders are, you know, struggling to keep up with the demand, clearly.  Inventories are tremendously low.  We’re, we’re all hearing those stories.  And if you’re—if you’re an entry level housing buyer, this is—this is a problem, because it just is going to be that much harder for people to get that first house, and that’s a problem.  I mean, we—it’s part of a strong economy, with people having money to spend and wanting to invest in housing.  So, in that sense, it’s good.  It’s clearly the strongest housing market that we’ve seen since the Global Financial Crisis.  And, you know, my hope would be that, over time, housing builders can react to this demand and, and come up with more supply and workers will come back to work in that industry. So, you know, it is—it’s not an unalloyed good to have prices going up this much, and we’re watching it very carefully.  I don’t see the kind of financial stability current concerns, though, that really do reside around the housing sector.  So many of the financial crackups in all countries, all western countries, that have happened in the last 30 years have been around housing.  We don’t—we really don’t see that here.  We don’t see bad loans and unsustainable prices and that kind of thing.

[SECTION]

CHRIS RUGABER.  Thanks for taking my question.  I wanted to ask about the labor anecdotes about businesses not able to find workers, [inaudible] back to the labor market for fear of getting sick, childcare concerns, and so forth.  Do you see these as also just sort of temporary bottlenecks that won’t have much effect on the long-term health of the labor market?  Or how are you thinking about these kinds of issues? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Chris, you were breaking up a little there, but I think I did get your question.  So I think there are a number of—a number of things going on there:  the tension between a high level of unemployment and yet many, many companies saying they can’t find—an elevated number of companies saying that they can’t find workers.  So, what’s really going on there? It, it should be a number of different things.  There are workers who don’t actually have the specific skills that the employers are looking for.  There may be geographical differences.  It, it may also be that, for example, there—one big factor would be, schools aren’t open yet, so there are still people who are at home taking care of their children and would like to be back in the workforce but can’t be yet.  There are people afraid of—there are virus fears that are weighing on people, so some—some people don’t want to go back to work.  There are also a significant number of people who say they’ve retired—a large number of people that say that they’re retired.  Now, it’s hard to say whether they will come back in as the labor market strengthens and as COVID, you know, becomes a—in the rearview mirror, in the history books, So—but clearly there’s something going, going on out there, as, as many companies are reporting labor shortages.  We don’t see wages moving up yet, and presumably we would see if you will.  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL that in a real—you know, in a really tight labor market.  And we may well start to see that.  I do think—so what will happen—what we saw during the last expansion, and it may be a different expansion, we don’t know, but, but what we saw was that labor supply generally showed up.  In other words, if you were worried about there—about running out of workers, it seemed like we never did.  You know, labor force participation held up.  People came in the labor force.  They stayed in the labor force longer than expected. So my guess would be that you will see people coming back into the labor force, and these jobs will be—the labor market will reach equilibrium.  Maybe pay will go up.  But I do think that—and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September, so to the extent that’s a factor, which is not clear, it will no longer be a factor fairly soon.  So my guess is, it will come back to this economy where we have, you know, equilibrium between labor supply and labor demand.  It may take some months, though.

CHRIS RUGABER.  Well [extended pause] 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  We, we lost you, Chris.  Let’s go on to Heather. 

[SECTION]

HEATHER SCOTT.  Thank you.  Good afternoon, Chair Powell.  I wanted to ask you, you know, you’ve been hearing, of course, these concerns raised by Larry Summers and others about inflation and the fact that they think the Fed might be—might let things get out of hand with the new policy stance.  So my question is, can you tell us, what is different this time versus previous periods like in the ’60s when inflation got out of control?  Why are you confident with,  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL with the lags in monetary policy that the Fed can get ahead of inflation and, and make sure it doesn’t go too far above the 2 percent target? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks for your question.  So I actually have a couple things I’d like to say about inflation, including addressing your question.  So let me start with just saying that we’re very strongly committed to achieving our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  Our, our price stability goal is 2 percent inflation over the longer run, and we believe that having inflation average 2 percent over time will help anchor long-term inflation expectations at 2 percent.  With inflation having run persistently below 2 percent for some time, the Committee seeks inflation moderately above inflation for two times—above 2 percent for some time. So, with a, a little bit of context, we’re, we’re making our way through an unprecedented series of events, really, in which a synchronized global shutdown is now giving way to widespread reopening of economies in many places around the world.  In the United States, fiscal and monetary policy continue to provide strong support:  Vaccinations are now widespread, and the economy is beginning to move ahead with real momentum.  During this time of reopening, we are likely to see some upward pressure on prices, and I’ll discuss why.  But those pressures are likely to be temporary as they are associated with the reopening process. In an episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not the same thing as, and is not likely to lead to, persistently higher year-over-year inflation into the future—inflation at levels that are not consistent with our goal of 2 percent inflation over time.  Indeed, it is the Fed’s job to make sure that that does not happen.  If, if, contrary to expectations, inflation were to move persistently and materially above 2 percent in a manner that threatened to move longer-term inflation expectations materially above 2 percent, we would use our tools to bring  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL inflation and expectations down to mandate-consistent levels.  And I would say, if I may, that is a principal difference from—we’re all very familiar at the Fed with the history of the 1960s and ’70s, of course.  And we know that our job is to achieve 2 percent inflation over time.  We’re committed to that, and we will use our tools to do that.  So that’s a very different situation than you had back in the 1960s—or many, many differences, actually. So let me talk quickly about the two reasons—two, or you could say three, but really two main reasons why we think inflation will move up in the near term.  The first is the base effects.  Twelve-month measures of inflation are likely to move well above 2 percent over the next few months as the very low inflation readings recorded in March and April of last year drop out of the calculation.  That process has already started to show up.  You saw it in the March CPI reading, and you’ll see it later this week in the PCE price data.  These base effects will contribute about 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in they’ll be transitory.  They carry no implication for the rate of inflation in later periods.  So that’s base effects. The other big one I would talk about is bottlenecks.  So this is what we’re seeing in supply chains in various industries, and we’re, we’re in close touch with all of these industries.  You know, the Fed has a network of contacts that is unequaled in businesses and in nonprofits for that matter, too.  So what do we mean by a bottleneck?  A bottleneck really is a temporary blockage or restriction in the supply chain for, for a particular good or goods, something that slows down the process of producing goods and delivering them to the market.  We think of bottlenecks as things that, in their nature, will be resolved as workers and businesses adapt, and we think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy since they’re temporary and  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL expected to resolve themselves.  We know that the base effects will disappear in a few months.  It’s much harder to predict with confidence the amount of time it will take to resolve the bottlenecks, or for that matter, the temporary effects that they will have on prices in the meantime. So, you know, I’ll just sum up and say, we understand our job.  We will do our job.  And we are, we are focused—as you’ve seen, for many years, we’ve been focused on inflation deviating below 2 percent, and we used our tools aggressively to keep it back up at 2 percent.  If, if we see inflation moving materially above 2 percent in a persistent way that risks inflation expectations drifting up, then we will use our tools to guide inflation and expectations back down to 2 percent.  No one should doubt that we will do that.  This is not what we expect.  But no one should doubt that, in the event, we would be prepared to use our tools. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  James Politi. 

[SECTION]

JAMES POLITI.  Chair Powell, you said a few weeks ago that it would—thank you, Chair Powell.  You said a few weeks ago that it would take a string of months of job creation of about a million to achieve progress towards your goal.  Can you define what your, what your definition of “a string of months” is more specifically?  And, on inflation, the FOMC said the rise in inflation we’re beginning to see largely reflects transitory factors, as you just described.  But why use the word “largely,” and what are the factors driving higher prices that may not be transitory, based on the initial data that you’re seeing? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, what is “a string”?  What do I mean by “a string”?  Well, I would say, what we have right now is one really good—I can tell you what it’s not.  It’s not one really good employment reading, which is what we got in March.  We got close to a million jobs in  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL more like that.  We’re 8½ million jobs below where we were in February of 2020, and that doesn’t account for growth in the labor force and growth in the economy, that trend we were on.  So we have—we’re a long way from our, our goals.  And we don’t have to get all the way to our goals to taper asset purchases, we just need to make substantial further progress.  It’s going to take some time. On, on “largely,” there are a bunch of factors.  I was really thinking—we were thinking of the base effects and also the energy effects.  I wasn’t meaning to say there are some real effects.  I mean, there are always—there are always relative prices going up and down within inflation.  You know, there’s a basket for CPI or PCE.  There are, you know, many, many, many factors that go into it.  Relative prices are always moving up and down.  This, this—we think it’s, it’s very fair to say that the increases we see and, frankly, are about to see later this week are largely due to base effects.  It would have been more contentious to say “entirely due to base effects” because there are some things that are always going up, and so we just said “largely.”

[SECTION]

CATARINA SARAIVA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  Over the past decade, the Fed has invested significant resources in large-scale bank supervision—has completely overhauled that approach.  And it’s even created a special committee that looks horizontally across the largest banks to find common risks.  Did the Fed not see that multiple banks had large exposures to Archegos?  If not, why not?  And then, what regulatory changes would you like to see implemented to change that going forward? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We’re, we, we supervise banks to make sure that they have risk-management systems in place so that they can spot these things.  We don’t manage their companies for them or, or try to manage individual risks.  In the grand scheme of these large  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL institutions, the Archegos risks were not systemically important or were not of the size that they would have really created trouble for any of those institutions. What was troubling, though, was that this could happen in a business for a number of firms that is thought to be—to carry relatively well understood risks.  The prime brokerage business is, is a well understood business, and so it was surprising that a number of them would have had this.  And it was essentially, I believe, the fact that, that they had the same big risk position on with a number of firms, and they weren’t—some of the firms were not aware that there were other firms that had those things.  I, I wouldn’t say it’s in any way an indictment of our supervision of these firms.  It, it—in some cases, it may be they were—it seems as though there were risk-management breakdowns at some of the firms, not all of them.  And that’s what we’re looking into.

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I—I’m wondering, are you planning to visit the homeless encampment that’s near the Fed in Washington that you drive by?  Have you been invited, and if you went, what would you be looking to learn there? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, frankly, yes.  I have not had a chance to do it yet, but I’ve been very busy, but I will visit.  I don’t want to visit it at a time of a lot of media attention, because I don’t want that to be part of the story.  But I will—I will go visit when, when it’s no longer a, a news story.  And I—you know, I—I’ve met with homeless people many times, a number of times, anyway, let’s say.  And I, I think it’s always good to talk to people and hear what’s going on in their lives.  What you find out is, they’re you.  They’re just us.  I mean, they’re, they’re—these are people who, in many cases, had jobs and, you know, they have lives, and they’ve just, they’ve just found themselves in this place.  It’s, it’s a—it’s a difficult problem,  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL though.  You know, there are many, many facets of it, and I’m well aware that this is not something that the Fed has all the tools for or anything like that.  But I, I will do that when, when the need arises and when, when it’s not so much, you know, in the public eye. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  And is there anything specifically that you would be looking to learn there? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Not really.  I mean, I, I think I know what I’ll find there.  I, I think you, you connect with these people and what you—again, what you find is, they’re like you.  That could be you.  I mean, that could be your sister.  That could be, you know, your kid.  You, you always feel that way in that sort of an encounter, and, you know, it just is a—it’s a—it’s an important thing to engage in, I think.  And I think, you know, we bring that understanding into our lives and, frankly, into our work—the work that we do as well. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Hannah Lang. 

[SECTION]

HANNAH LANG.  Hi.  I wanted to ask about digital currency.  You previously said a few times that you think it’s important for the U.S. to get a central bank digital currency right rather than be first.  But with countries like China moving very quickly on CBDC, I was wondering what you think the risks are of, of moving too slow on, on digital currency. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So I think the first thing to say is that we feel an obligation to understand the technology and all of the policy issues very, very well.  Central bank digital currencies are now possible, and we’re going to see some of them around the world.  And we need to understand whether that’s something that would be a good thing for the people that we serve.  How would it work in our system?  And there are some very, very difficult questions to answer, but I think we—and we are engaged in a serious program to understand both the technology and the policy issues.  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL I am—I would say this:  We’re the world’s reserve currency, and that means that the dollar is used in transactions all around the world, far more than any other currency.  And that’s because of our rule of law; our democratic institutions, which are the best in the world; our economy; our industrious people; all the things that make the United States the United States.  That’s why we’re the, the reserve currency.  And, of course, we have open capital accounts, which is essential if you’re going to be the reserve currency.  So those are the factors that make us the reserve currency. I am—I’m less concerned that someone—that another country might have a digital currency first.  You know, ask yourself the question, does that mean that, if you were a company that’s doing international business, would you then suddenly start to use that currency to use your—do your international transactions, or would you still do them in dollars, where, where—which is what everyone does?  And I’m not so concerned about, about that.  I am really concerned about getting it right. It is—it is a—it is a tricky set of questions that we have to navigate in a world where we already have, remember, a highly evolved payment system.  We have FedNow and other immediately available funds.  Pretty soon everybody will be able to, to do what people do in other parts of the world, which is just use their phone to make immediately available payments all the time.  It’ll be normal.  And what would be the role of a central bank digital currency in that kind of an environment?  Far more important to get it right than it is to do it fast or feel that we need to rush to reach conclusions because other countries are moving ahead. I mean, that—what the China—the currency that’s being used in China is not one that would—that would work here.  It’s, it’s one that really allows the government to see every payment that’s used—for which it is used in real time.  It’s much more to do with things that are  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL happening within their own financial system than it is, I think, to do with, with the global—you know, sort of global competition.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Michael Derby. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Thank you for taking my question.  I wanted to ask you another question about inflation, and it has to do with inflation expectations.  A number of different surveys and, and market indicators are showing, you know, multiyear highs in inflation expectations ratings.  So I wondered, you know, if, if that was something that you saw consistent with your inflation outlook.  Is that something that worries you, or do you see that as, maybe, you know, the success of the Fed’s new inflation framework, you know, making it out to the, to the broader public? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  Inflation expectations before the pandemic hit—and here we think of survey, market based—survey being either households or, or economists and, and would have been consistent with a 2 percent inflation target, particularly our 2 percent inflation target, which calls for 2 percent average inflation.  So they’re at the low end.  Inflation expectations actually went down a bit at the beginning of the pandemic, and now they’ve just moved back up to levels broadly—that, that are where they were in 2018, or in some cases 2014, and, I would say, more consistent with our mandate. And we want them to be—we want them to be higher and—you know, on a persistent basis.  We want inflation to run a little bit higher than it has been running for the last quarter of a century.  We want it to average 2 percent, not 1.7 percent.  And for that, we need to see inflation expectations that are consistent with that, really well anchored at 2 percent.  We don’t really see that yet, but I would say that, that, you know, breakevens have moved up, in a way.  Breakevens  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL are based on CPI, of course, but they’re, they’re now at levels that are—that are pretty close to mandate consistent, whereas before, they were below.  We monitor inflation expectations very, very carefully, as you would obviously know.  So that’s where—that’s where I would say it is. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Just one small follow-up.  Do you have any redlines on inflation readings where if, you know, you hit, like, a certain number on, say, you know, core PCE, that would be, you know, a trigger response from the Fed? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  It doesn’t work that way.  You know, we’re, we’re—inflation measures are always going to be a bit volatile.  We expect—as I mentioned, we expect core and, and headline PCE to move up because of base effects, and—you know, I—and we expect that to go away.  We, we also expect these, these bottleneck effects to come in.  We don’t know how persistent they’ll be.  We, we think they’ll—you know, it’s a matter of, of when they will pass through, not whether they will pass through.  But we can’t be confident about the exact timing of that or the size of them.  They don’t seem especially large at the moment, but, you know, we, we don’t know. I mean, you know, this is—this is all about the reopening of the economy.  That’s what’s happening.  We had it—we were in a deep, deep hole a year ago, and now, with a lot of help from fiscal policy, some additional help from monetary policy, and, you know, a great deal of help from vaccination, we’re seeing a strong rebound in activity.  And what’s happening is, it’s, it’s—demand can be spurred with fiscal transfers and—the saved-up fiscal transfers and, and people going back to work and things like that.  The supply side will take a little bit of time to adapt.  New restaurants will have to be opened.  The supply of various inputs into the goods part of the economy will have to be brought back up to speed.  And you—you’re seeing some of that.   April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL That’ll happen over a period of time, over coming quarters.  You’ll see some of the bottlenecks resolved, but the last one may not be resolved for some time. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Brian Cheung. 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Brian Cheung with—hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  I wanted to ask about financial stability, which is a part of the Fed’s reaction function here.  It seems like to people on the outside who might not follow finance daily, they’re paying attention to things like GameStop, now Dogecoin.  And it seems like there’s interesting reach for yield in this market—to some extent, also Archegos.  So does the Fed see a relationship between low rates and easy policy to those things, and is there a financial stability concern from the Fed’s perspective at this time? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So we look at—financial stability for us is really—we have a broad framework, so we don’t just jump from one thing to another.  I know many people just look at asset prices, and they look at some of the things that are going on in the—in the equity to stick to a framework for financial stability so we can—so we can talk about it the same way each time and so we can be held accountable for it. So one of the areas is asset prices, and I would say some of the asset prices are high.  You are seeing, seeing things in the capital markets that, that are—that are a bit frothy.  That’s a fact.  I won’t say it has nothing to do with monetary policy, but it also—it has a tremendous amount to do with vaccination and reopening of the economy.  That’s really what has been moving markets a lot in the last few months is this turn away from what was a pretty dark winter to now a fast—a much faster vaccination process and a faster reopening.  So that’s, that’s part of what’s going on.  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL The other—the other things, though—you know, leverage in the financial system, is it—is, is not a problem.  That’s a—that’s a—that was one of the four pillars.  Asset prices was one.  Leverage in the financial system is, is not an issue; we have very well capitalized large banks.  We have funding risks for, for our largest financial institutions that are also very low.  We do have some funding risk issues around money market funds, but I would say they’re not systemic right now. And, and the household sector is actually in pretty good shape.  It was in—it was in a very good shape as a relative matter before the financial crisis—sorry, the pandemic crisis hit.  There were real concerns, of course, with high levels of unemployment and loss of wages and all of that, that the—that the household sector would, would, would weaken dramatically.  That hasn’t happened.  So, with the fiscal transfers, money that’s on household balance sheets, they’re in good shape.  You see relatively low defaults and that kind of thing. So the overall financial stability picture is mixed, but, on balance, it’s—you know, it’s manageable, I would say.  And it’s—by the way, I think it’s appropriate and important for financial conditions to remain accommodative to support economic activity.  Again, 8½ million people who had jobs in February don’t have them now, and, you know, there’s a long way to go until we reach our goal.  So that’s what I would say. 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  As a follow-up, you mentioned money market pressures.  The Fed didn’t make changes to interest on reserves or excess reserves.  What was the logic behind that? It seems like SOFR has been drifting closer to zero.  So just hoping for clarification on that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So the federal funds rate has been well within target and—at target range, and money market funds—money market conditions are, are fine.  We have the ability to use our administrative tools to make sure that that remains the case.  We do expect  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL further downward pressure on, on rates through asset purchases and also the runoff in the—in the Treasury General Account.  But, at this point, we didn’t see a need for—to, to deploy our tools to, to support rates.  And, of course, we will do so if, if the need does arise. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Jean Yung. 

[SECTION]

JEAN YUNG.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I wanted to ask a, a similar question.  We are seeing elevated market valuations, and some economists are concerned that the economy might overheat, at least for a period of time.  So should the Fed and other regulators be thinking about tightening capital requirements or extending oversight to the nonbank sector so that financial stability risks stay as low as they have been?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I think capital requirements for banks are, to me—went up tremendously, really, over the course of the 10 years between the financial crisis and the arrival of the pandemic.  And the banks really made it through a real stress test very well and passed three, three of our—two of our stress tests, and that is another one that’s pending.  So capital is, is in a good place, as far as I’m concerned, in the banking system. But, to your point, what we saw was—so what, what kind of happened during the pandemic crisis that, that requires attention, and number one is money market funds and corporate bond funds where we saw run dynamics again, and we need to—we’re, we’re looking at that.  So we’re looking at ways, and people around the world are looking at ways, to make those vehicles resilient so that they don’t have to be, you know, supported by the government whenever there’s, you know, severely stressed market conditions.  It’s a private business.  They, they need to have the wherewithal to stay in business and not just count on the Fed and others to—around the world to come in.  So that was that.  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL The other one is Treasury market structure.  Dealers are committing less capital to that activity now than they were 10 or 15 years ago, and the need for capital is higher because there’s so much more supply of Treasuries.  And so there are some questions about Treasury market structure, and there’s a lot of careful work going on to understand whether there’s something we can do about this, because we—you know, the U.S. Treasury market is probably the most single important—single most important market in, in the economy and the world.  It needs to be liquid.  It needs to function well for the good of our economy and the good of our citizens. So it’s not clear what, what—where that takes you, but we, we are taking a careful look—and the Treasury Department is, is really going to be leading this—at, at Treasury market structure and all of the various aspects of that to make sure that we do have a resilient, strong Treasury market that can work even in difficult times.  As, as you know, at the very beginning of the financial—of the—of this recent crisis, there was such a demand for selling Treasuries, including by foreign central banks, that, really, the dealers couldn’t handle the volume.  And so what was happening was, the market was really starting to lose function, and that’s—that was a really serious problem which we had to solve through really massive asset purchases.  And, you know, so we’d like to, we’d like to see if there isn’t something we can do to—is—do we need to build against that kind of an extreme tail risk, and if so, what would that look like? 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Edward Lawrence. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Fed Chairman, for the question.  So I’m interested in your thoughts.  There’s so much fiscal help and accommodation from the Federal Reserve.  You said today the vaccinations will follow the normal economic conditions or, or lead to more normal economic conditions later this year.  When do you see the economy being able to stand on its own feet, so to speak?  And, along those lines, with the fiscal spending and the  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL accommodation you talked about with transitory inflation, does more spending need to be injected into the system, or will that affect that transitory nation—nature of the inflation?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  When will the economy be, be able to stand on its own feet?  I’m not sure if—I’m not sure what the exact nature of that question is. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  What, what I’m saying is, is, you know, when will the—when will you need to lower the, the amount of Treasuries you’re buying to sort of taper off a little bit?  When can it stand without having that support from the monetary policy side?  And then—and then, further, the transitory. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  Sorry.  So we have—you know, we’ve articulated our test for that, as you know, and that is just, we’ll continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress.  And we’re, we’re going to communicate well in advance of any And, and so there’ll be a lot of warning and that kind of thing.  But it’s about substantial further progress toward our goals.  That’s, that’s really all it is.  It doesn’t have any, any external, virus-related specific requirement, although, again, I do think it’ll—you know, the, the virus will need to continue to be controlled for us to achieve those economic goals.  But it’s really the economic goals. Now, your second question.  Sorry, just say again.  I didn’t quite get that question. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Yes, sure.  With all the fiscal spending that’s happened and the accommodation and—does, does the system need more spending either from the fiscal side or accommodation, or would more spending affect the transitory nature of the inflation and put those upward, upward pressures on inflation long term?  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So it’s really up to Congress.  We—we’re not an adviser to Congress.  You know, we don’t, we don’t weigh in on specific fiscal bills or proposals.  That’s really between elected parties.  You know, basically, fiscal policy is the province of people who stand for democratic election and win, and they get to make those very difficult decisions, and they get to be accountable to the voters.  We didn’t do any of that, and we don’t have a seat at that table.  We don’t seek a seat at that table.  So that’s really something for Congress and the Administration to, to deal with. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Greg Robb. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Hi, Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Thank you—thank you so much for the—for the opportunity.  I wanted to circle back to the housing market.  It’s just kind of confusing that the question and your answer—you know, the housing market is strong, prices are up.  And yet the Fed is buying $40 billion per month in mortgage-related assets.  Why is that, and are those purchases playing a role at all in pushing up prices?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  I, I mean, we’re—we started buying MBS because the mortgage-backed security market was, was really experiencing severe dysfunction, and we’ve sort of, sort of articulated, you know, what our exit path is from that.  It’s not meant to provide direct assistance to, to the housing market.  That was never the intent.  It was really just to keep that as—it’s a very close relation to the Treasury market and a very important market on its own.  And so that’s, that’s why we, we bought as we did during the Global Financial Crisis; we bought MBS too.  Again, not, not an intention to send help to the housing market, which was, which was really not, not a problem this time at all.  So—and, you know, it’s, it’s a situation where we will, we will taper asset purchases when the time comes to do that, and those, those purchases will come to zero over time.  And that time is not yet.  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  And for the last question, we’ll go to Mike McKee. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since I am last, let me go back to Paul’s question, the first question, and ask him—ask you whether—not whether you’re thinking about thinking of tapering, but why you’re not.  We’re seeing bank lending fall.  The markets seem to be operating well.  Are you afraid of a taper tantrum?  Or is it, as one money manager put it, “If you get out of the markets, there aren’t enough buyers for all of the Treasury debt, and so rates would have to go way up”?  The bottom-line question is, what do we get for $120 billion a month that we couldn’t get for less? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So it’s really not more complicated than this.  We, we articulated the “substantial further progress” test at our December meeting.  And, really, for the next couple of months, we made relatively little progress toward our goals.  And, remember, substantial further progress from December—from our December meeting.  And then vaccination started to get more widespread.  The economy reopened.  We got a really nice job report for March.  It doesn’t constitute substantial further progress.  It’s not close to substantial further progress. We’re hopeful that we will see along this path a way to that goal.  And we believe we will; it just is a question of when.  And so, when that time—when the time comes for us to talk about talking about it, we’ll do that.  And—but that time is not now.  It’s—we’re just not—we’re not that far.  We’ve had one great jobs report.  It’s not enough.  You know, we’re going to act on actual data, not on our forecast.  And we’re just going to need to see more data.  That’s—it’s no, no more complicated than that.  April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Well, if you leave rates where they are, it doesn’t change anything.  But does it change anything if you actually tapered a bit?  If you spent less, would you still get the same effect on the economy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  If we bought less?  You’re, you’re very faint.  So if someone has the volume, they can turn it up.  But if we bought less, you know, no.  I mean, I think the effect is proportional to the amount we buy.  It’s, it’s really part of overall accommodative financial conditions.  We, we have tried to create accommodative financial conditions to support economic activity, and we did that. And we articulated the—you know, the, the tests for withdrawing that accommodation.  And we think, you know—so we’re waiting to see those tests to be fulfilled both for asset purchases and for liftoff of rates.  And, you know, when the tests are fulfilled, we’ll, we’ll go ahead.  As we—you know, we’ve done this before.  We did it in, in the last—after the last crisis, and, you know, we’ll do it in, in maybe—we’ll do it—as those tests are satisfied, we’ll do it.  And the—and the only thing that will guide us is, are the tests met?  You know, that, that’s what we focused on:  Is—have, have the macroeconomic conditions that we’ve articulated, have they been realized?  That will be the test for, for tapering asset purchases and for raising interest rates.

CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
44,2021-06-16,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability. Today the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our asset purchases.  These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete. Widespread vaccinations, along with unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also providing strong support to the recovery.  Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades.  Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounceback in activity from depressed levels.  The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement.  Household spending is rising at a rapid pace, boosted by the ongoing reopening of the economy, fiscal support, and accommodative financial conditions.  The housing sector is strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace.  In some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity.  Forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our March Summary of Economic Projections.  Even so, the recovery is incomplete, and risks to the economic outlook remain. As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, although the pace of improvement has been uneven.  Employment rose 419,000 per month, on average, in April and May, with the leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains.  Employment in this sector and the economy as a whole remains well below pre- June 16, 2021  pandemic levels.  The unemployment rate remained elevated in May at 5.8 percent, and this   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year.  Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth.  These factors should wane in coming months against a backdrop of rising vaccinations, leading to more rapid gains in employment.  Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.5 percent at the end of this year and declining to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit.  In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and Hispanics. Inflation has increased notably in recent months.  The 12-month change in PCE prices was 3.6 percent in April and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating.  Part of the increase reflects the very low readings from early in the pandemic falling out of the calculation as well as the pass-through of past increases in oil prices to, to consumer energy prices.  Beyond these effects, we are also seeing upward pressure on prices from the rebound in spending as the economy continues to reopen, particularly as supply bottlenecks have limited how quickly production in some sectors can respond in the near term.  These bottleneck effects have been larger than anticipated, and FOMC participants have revised up their projections for, for inflation notably for this year.  As these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected  June 16, 2021  to drop back toward our longer-run goal, and the median inflation projection falls from   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL 3.4 percent this year to 2.1 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2023. The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic.  As the reopening continues, shifts in demand can be large and rapid, and bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect.  Our new framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal.  Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have generally reversed the declines seen earlier in the pandemic and have moved into a range that appears broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.  If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we’d be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy. The pandemic continues to pose risks to the economic outlook.  Progress on vaccinations has limited the spread of COVID-19 and will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy.  However, the pace of vaccinations has slowed, and new strains of the virus remain a risk.  Continued progress on vaccinations will support a return to more normal economic conditions. The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation  June 16, 2021  moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.  We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.  With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. As is evident in the SEP, many participants forecast that these favorable economic conditions will be met somewhat sooner than previously projected; the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate now lies above the effective lower bound in 2023.  Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a couple of years from now.  More important than any forecast is the fact that, whenever liftoff comes, policy will remain highly accommodative.  Reaching the conditions for liftoff will mainly signal that the recovery is strong and no longer requires holding rates near zero. In addition, we are continuing to increase—continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  The increase in our balance sheet since March 2020 has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy.  June 16, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee had a discussion on the progress made toward our goals since the Committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last participants expect that progress will continue.  In coming meetings, the Committee will continue to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals.  As we have said, we will provide advance notice before announcing any decision to make changes to our purchases. On a final note, we made a technical adjustment today to the Federal Reserve’s administered rates.  The IOER and overnight RRP rates were adjusted upward by 5 basis points in order to keep the federal funds rate well within the target range and to support smooth functioning in money markets.  This technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate or stance of monetary policy. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions.  I’m wondering if you can walk us through expectations you have, specifically when it comes to the labor market going into 2023.  And I’m curious about people who may have left the labor market, who have yet to come back, or who may face issues with childcare.  Perhaps they’ve retired early.  Any barriers that you see in keeping people from the labor market as you consider full employment going into 2023?  Thank you.  June 16, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  So I would say, if you look at the labor market and you look at the demand for workers and the level of job creation and think ahead, I think it’s clear, and I am confident, that we are on a path to a very strong labor market—a labor market that, that shows low unemployment, high participation, rising wages for people across the spectrum.  I mean, I think that’s, that’s shown in our projections, it’s shown in outside projections.  And if you look through the current time frame and think one and two years out, we’re going to be looking at a very, very strong labor market. In terms of exactly what that means, we’ll, we’ll have to see how things evolve.  I think we learned during the course of the last very long expansion, the longest in our history, that labor supply during a long expansion can exceed expectations, can move above its estimated trend.  And, and I have no reason to think that that won’t happen again.  At the same time, we have seen—in terms of participation, we’ve seen a significant number of, of people retire.  And so we, we don’t actually know exactly what labor force participation will be as we go forward, but I, I would tend to, to look at it and think that it—that it can return to high levels, although it may take some time to do that.  But overall, this is—this is going to be, you know, a very strong labor In terms of the near term, you ask as well—so we see a couple of things, a few things that seem likely to be holding back labor supply.  There are very large amounts of job openings, and there are a very large number of people who, who are unemployed.  And the pace of, of filling those jobs is—somehow feels slower than it might be.  So I’d point to a number of things, the first of which is just that most of the, the act of sort of going back to one’s old job—that’s kind of already happened.  So this is a question of people finding a new job.  And that’s just a process that takes longer.  There may be something of a speed limit on it.  You’ve got to find a job  June 16, 2021  where, where your skills match what, you know, what, what the employer wants.  It’s got to be   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL in the right area.  There’s just a lot that goes into the function of finding a job.  So that’s, that’s sort of a natural thing. In addition, I would say that we, we look at, for example, a, a significant number of people still say that they’re concerned about going back to work in jobs where there’s a lot of public facing because of—because of COVID.  So that’s clearly holding back some people, and that should diminish as vaccinations move ahead. There’s also the question of childcare.  Many are engaged in, in caretaking.  And as schools reopen and, and, and childcare/daycare centers open in the fall—in the fall, then we should see—we should see that supporting labor force participation by caretakers. Finally, unemployment insurance for something like 15 million people will either end or be diminished as we move through the summer and into, into, into the fall by the end of you would think that that would add to an increase in job creation as well.  So you put all those together, I would expect that we would see strong job creation building up over the summer and going into—going into the fall. I will also say, though, the last thing I’ll say is, this is an extraordinarily unusual time.  And we, we really don’t have a template or, or, you know, any experience of, of a situation like this.  And so I think we have to be humble about our ability to understand the data.  It’s not a time to try to reach hard conclusions about the labor market, about inflation, about the path of policy.  We need to see more data.  We need to be a little bit patient.  And I do think, though, that we’ll, we’ll, we’ll be seeing some things coming up in coming months that will—that will inform our, our thinking.  June 16, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Paul Kiernan. 

[SECTION]

PAUL KIERNAN.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Thanks for the question.  Your—the Committee’s median forecast on inflation seems to assume a pretty, pretty tame outlook for the rest of the year.  As you know, the three-month annualized rate for the past three months was, I think, 8.4 percent in the CPI.  And I’m just wondering sort of how much longer we can sustain those, those kinds of rates before you get nervous.  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So inflation has come in above expectations over the last few months.  But if you look behind the headline numbers, you’ll see that the incoming data are, are consistent with the view that prices—that prices that are driving that higher inflation are from categories that are being directly affected by the recovery from the pandemic and the reopening of the economy. So, for example, the experience with, with lumber prices is, is illustrative of this.  The thought is that prices like that that have moved up really quickly because of the shortages and bottlenecks and the like, they should stop going up, and at some point, they, they, in some cases, should actually go down.  And we did see that in the case of lumber. Another example where we haven’t seen that yet is prices for used cars, which accounted for more than a third of the total increase in core inflation.  Used car prices are going up because of sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and limited supply.  It’s going up at just an amazing annual rate.  But we do think that it makes sense that that would stop, and that in fact it would reverse over time.  So we think we’ll be seeing some of that. When will we be seeing it?  We’re not sure.  That narrative seems, still seems quite likely to prove correct, although, you know, as I pointed out at the last press conference, the, the timing of that is, is pretty uncertain, and so are the, the effects in the near term.  But over time, it seems  June 16, 2021  likely that these very specific things that are driving up inflation will be—will be temporary.    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL And we’ll be, you know, we’re going to be looking.  We’ll be looking at the monthly pricing data.  I’ll, I’ll also say that the labor market is going to be important, both for the maximum-employment goal, but also for inflation.  And we’ll be looking at that.  And, and as I—as I mentioned, we expect and I expect that we’ll see increases in supply over coming months as the factors that we believe have been suppressing supply abate, wane, move down.  So I, I can’t give you an exact number or an exact time, but I would say that we do expect inflation to move down.  If you look at the—if you look at the forecast for 2021 and—sorry, 2022 and 2023 among my colleagues on the, on the Federal Open Market Committee, you will see that people do expect inflation to move down meaningfully toward our goal.  And I think the full range of, of, of inflation projections for 2023 falls between 2 and 2.3 percent, which is consistent with our—with our goals. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Now we’ll go to Ylan Mui at CNBC. 

[SECTION]

YLAN MUI.  Hi.  Thank you, Chair Powell, for doing this.  My question for you is that you mentioned that your colleagues did have a discussion about the progress that you’re making toward your, your goals in order to consider tapering your asset purchases.  In that discussion, you said that you didn’t—haven’t made substantial progress yet, but that you expect to continue to make progress.  In that discussion, did you guys talk about a timeline for when you expect to see that progress be made and when you might consider starting to reduce those purchases? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So I, I expect that we’ll be able to say more about timing as we see more data.  Basically, there’s not a lot of more light I can—I can shed on that.  But you can think of this meeting that we had as the “talking about talking about” meeting, if you like.  And I now suggest that we retire that term, which has—which has served its purpose well, I  June 16, 2021  think.  So Committee participants were of the view that since we adopted that guidance in   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL substantial further progress.  Participants expect continued progress ahead toward that objective.  And assuming that is the case, it will be appropriate to consider announcing a plan for reducing our asset purchases at a future meeting.  So at coming meetings, the Committee will continue to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals, and we’ll give advance notice before announcing any decision.  The timing, of course, Ylan, will depend on the pace of that progress and not on any calendar. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Now we’ll go to Chris Rugaber, AP. 

[SECTION]

CHRIS RUGABER.  Right.  Thank you.  Well, you mentioned—let me ask about inflation expectations.  You said they were—I think you mentioned in your opening statement that you saw them as within target.  Does that mean that some of the shorter-term measures we’ve seen out there such as the New York Federal Reserve’s three-year outlook, which jumped a bit—should those sort of be dismissed?  And are we only looking at longer-term inflation expectations?  And would you describe those as still well anchored at this point?  And on a related note, would the Fed consider publishing its index of common inflation expectations on a monthly basis?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we, we do tend to look at the longer-term inflation expectations, because that’s really, we think, what matters for, for inflation.  So and, and, you know, the shorter-term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices.  So you’ll see if gasoline prices were to spike, you’ll see the shorter-term inflation expectation measures, particularly the surveys, move up.  And, and that’s, that’s maybe not a good signal for future inflation if, if gas happens to spike and then go back down again.  June 16, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL So we—yes, I think if, if you look at the broad range of longer-term inflation expectations, they’ve moved up.  They moved down during the beginning of the pandemic, you know, sort of further exacerbating concerns that we might find ourselves where, for example, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have been, where you have expectations and inflation itself sliding down and you have a really hard time stopping that process once it begins.  So that was a concern.  So it’s, it’s good, actually, to see inflation—longer-term inflation expectations move back up to a range—it’s a range that’s consistent with what our objectives are. These are not precise measures, and that’s—and they, they contain risk premiums of various kinds.  And that’s why we look at a broad range of them and tend to look at the movement of that broad range of, of, of indicators, which are from, you know, surveys of economists, surveys of the public, and also market based.  It’s, it’s, it’s a wide index, as I’m sure you know.  We look at that, and we see them back in the range where they were.  And, by the way, they’ve been broadly higher than that, somewhat modestly higher than that, not so many years ago, at a time when inflation was, was, was still anchored at around 2 percent or maybe even a little bit below.  So the answer is, yes, I think they are anchored and they’re at a good place right now.  It’s gratifying to see them having moved up off of their pandemic lows.  And, you know, as you know, it’s, it’s fundamental in our framework, our new framework, to, to assure that inflation—longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at a place that is consistent with our goal.  We, we think that’s an important reason.  If, if inflation expectations are not anchored at a place that’s consistent with your goal, it’s not clear why you would expect to hit your goal over the longer term.  So it’s important. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMTH.  Okay, now we’ll go to James Politi with the FT.  June 16, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

JAMES POLITI.  Chair Powell—thanks, Chair Powell.  Your economic projections today forecast 7 percent growth in 2022, unemployment at 4½ percent, and core inflation of 3 percent.  If those conditions are achieved by the end of the year, would that constitute substantial further progress, in your mind?  And kind of more broadly, when you look at the sort of median forecast for interest rates in 2023 showing not one but two interest rate increases at the time, I mean, is this kind of—can you describe the sort of tone of the—of the discussion in the Committee?  And are we really moving towards sort of a post-pandemic stance?  Is there greater confidence that, you know, the recovery will be, you know, a full recovery sooner than expected? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  On your first question, the judgment of when we have arrived at substantial further progress is one that the Committee will make.  And it would not be appropriate for me to lay out particular numbers that do or do not—that do or do not qualify.  That is—that is, you know, the process that we’re beginning now at the next meeting.  We will begin, meeting by meeting, to, to assess that progress and talk about what we—what we think we’re seeing and, and just do all of the things that you do to sort of clarify your thinking around the process of deciding whether and how to adjust the pace and composition of asset purchases. In terms of the, the, the two hikes—so let me say a couple things first of all, not for the first time, about the—about the dot plot.  These are, of course, individual projections.  They’re not a Committee forecast, they’re not a plan.  And we did not actually have a discussion of whether liftoff is appropriate at any particular year, because discussing liftoff now would be—would be highly premature, wouldn’t make any sense.  If you look at the transcripts from five years ago, you’ll see that sometimes people mention their rate path in their interventions.  Often they don’t.  And the last thing to say is, the dots are not a great forecaster of, of future rate  June 16, 2021  moves.  And that’s not because—it’s just because it’s so highly uncertain.  There is no great   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL forecaster of, of future dots.  So, so dots to be taken with a—with a big, big grain of salt. However, so let me talk about this, this, this meeting.  The Committee spelled out, as you know, in our FOMC statements the conditions that it expects to see before an adjustment in the target range is made.  And it’s outcome based, it’s not time based.  And, as I mentioned, it’s labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, inflation at 2 percent and on track to exceed 2 percent.  In the projections, it gives some sense of how participants see the economy evolving in their most likely case.  And, honestly, the main message I would take away from the SEP is that participants—many, many participants are more comfortable that the economic conditions in the Committee’s forward guidance will be met somewhat sooner than previously anticipated.  And that would be a welcome development.  If such outcomes materialize, it means the economy will have made faster progress toward our goals. So the other thing I’ll say is, rate increases are really not at all the focus of the Committee.  The focus of the Committee is the current state of the economy.  But in terms of our tools, it’s about asset purchases.  That’s what we’re thinking about.  Liftoff is, is well into the future.  The conditions for liftoff—we’re very far from maximum employment, for example.  It’s, it’s a consideration for the future.  So the near-term thing is really—the real near-term discussion, discussion that will begin is really about the, the path of asset purchases.  And, as I mentioned, we had a discussion about that today and expect to, in future meetings, continue to think about our progress. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer from     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Continuing—Chair Powell, continuing in that vein, when you’re ready, how will you go about signaling the start of tapering when you do decide to  do that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So our intention for this process is that it will be orderly, methodical, and transparent.  And I can just tell you, we, we, we see real value in communicating well in advance what our thinking is.  And we’ll try to be clear.  And, as I mentioned, we’ll, we’ll give advance notice before announcing a decision to taper.  And so all I can say is that we, we think it’s important—we think where the balance sheet’s concerned, a lot of notice, as much transparency as we can give, and as far—as far in advance as we can to give people a chance to adjust their expectations.  And, you know, we expect to be in that business until we reach substantial further progress and then have a—have a decision.  Again, I have nothing further on time.  It wouldn’t be appropriate to say.  We’re going to have to see more data.  We’re a ways away from substantial further progress, we think.  But we’re making progress. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  So you can’t say generally how far in advance you would signal? much clarity as we can. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Again, as we—as we approach that goal, we’ll provide, you know, as 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Great, thank you.  Going to Craig Torres at Bloomberg. 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Craig Torres at Bloomberg.  If I were a businessman looking at the forecast today, I would ask how and when the Fed seeks to achieve an average of 2 percent inflation.  In other words, does the FOMC have a look-back period?  Or does it plan to suppress inflation in outer years because, over the next three years, you’re going to be above inflation?  So what is your look-back period?  Does the Committee have one?  And if not, why not?  And if  June 16, 2021  they don’t, why isn’t this just flexible inflation targeting without an average in a range of 2 to   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL 2¼ percent?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so as part of our year-and-a-half-long process, the review that we did and came out with at the end of that with the—with the new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we looked carefully at the idea.  We’ve all read all the literature around different formulas for makeup and things like that.  And we concluded—and, you know, I strongly agree—that it’s not wise to, to wed yourself to a particular formulation of that.  So we did adopt a discretionary—there’s an element of discretion in it.  You know, it says that we will seek to—seek inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent for some time.  And it’s, it’s meant to create a broad sense that we want inflation to average 2 percent over time.  And that under the old—under the old formula, under the old framework, what was happening was, 2 percent was a ceiling because all of the errors were below.  You were always getting back to 2 percent.  So you were bouncing back and forth between 1½ and 2, and we wanted them to be centered around 2.  So, so that’s, that’s the approach that we’re taking.  And you’re right, it’s not—it’s not a formulaic approach.  We were clear on that when we announced the framework.  Was there another part of your question, Craig? 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  That pretty much answers it, Chair Powell.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Now we’ll go to Michael Derby. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Thanks for taking my question.  So I wanted to ask you about the reverse repo usage that we’ve seen lately.  I was curious if you are at all concerned about the level of money flowing into the reverse repo facility.  And do you believe that the changes in the Fed’s rate control toolkit today will have any impact on that?  And then, in a related question, do  June 16, 2021  you think that Fed asset purchases are taking too many safe assets out of the market right now   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL and creating maybe some dislocations in the money markets? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So on the—on the facility, we think it’s doing its job.  We think it’s doing—the reverse repo facility is, is doing what it’s supposed to do, which is to provide a floor under money market rates and keep the federal funds rate well within its—well within its range.  So we’re not concerned with it.  It’s doing—you have an unusual situation where the Treasury General Account is, is shrinking and bill supply is shrinking.  And so there’s, there’s downward pressure—we’re buying assets—there’s downward pressure on short-term rates, and that facility is, is doing what we think it’s supposed to do.  Sorry, your second question was again? 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Yeah, I mean, the change in the rate control toolkit, will that have any impact on—do you think that will reduce the, the amount of money coming into reverse repos?  Will that have any impact on money market conditions that, you know, beyond the fed funds rate setting? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  It could have some impact.  I think we’ll have to see empirically.  But it’s designed to keep the federal funds rate, you know, within the range.  And I do think it could have some effect on, on broader money market conditions below as it relates to, you know, the very low rates and the downward pressures. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  And will it—do think it will lower uptake on the reverse repo facility, or that’s just not even really a focus of what the change was? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  It’s not, honestly.  And, you know, the funny thing, you would think that it would, but we’ll have to see.  It’s, it’s possible that that would not be the case.  That’s going to be an empirical question. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Okay, cool.  Thank you.  June 16, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  We’ll go to Jeanna Smialek, the New York Times. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hey, Chair Powell.  Thank you for taking our questions.  I was wondering if you could follow up a little bit on your response to Rachel at the very beginning and talk a little bit about how we should understand what full employment means in a world that, as you mentioned, is pretty roiled.  All the data is pretty—has been pretty roiled by the pandemic, and we’re not really sure where EPOP is going to settle in, we’re not sure where participation is going to settle in.  And wages are already looking, you know, decent.  So I guess I wonder what full employment means in this context and, and sort of how you’re thinking about those wage data. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  As, as you well know, there isn’t one indicator we can look to, and there’s no one number that we can therefore point to.  We look at a range of indicators, and it’s a very broad range, you can count to a high number just quickly—but, but, certainly, it will include things like unemployment and participation and wages and many different flavors of that.  So how do we think about it?  A couple of things.  We’re all going to be informed by what we saw in the last cycle, which was labor supply outperforming expectations over a long period of time.  Now, that hadn’t happened in many other cycles, but this was a very long cycle.  So we’re going to have to be alert to see whether that can happen again.  It is a different—it’s a different economy.  We, we have had a slew of retirements, and that may weigh on participation.  That, that effect, though, should wear off in a few years and, and, you know, as you move through that window, because they would have—people would have retired anyway, and you’ll be back where you, you would have been.  So I think we’re—I think that lesson number one is, is just to be careful about assessing maximum employment.  And I think if you—during the last cycle, there were—there were waves of concern that we were reaching full employment as early,  June 16, 2021  you know, as, as 2012, when I arrived at the Fed.  And, you know—you know, nine years later—  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   eight years later, we were still creating jobs.  And, you know, it was quite remarkable.  So we’re all going to be informed by that.  At the same time, we understand this is a different economy.  You know, the, the demographics are, people are getting older, and that should have a secular effect of, of reducing participation over time.  So we have to be sensible about what, what can be done.  But I think we’re going to be—we’re going to lean into that and be optimistic. You asked about wages.  You know, we’re seeing wage increases.  That’s, that’s sort of a natural thing to be seeing in a strong economy.  And what we’re seeing is—we don’t see anything that’s troubling in the sense of—what would be troubling would be, you know, very wide across the economy, wages at unsustainable levels without high inflation.  In other words, wages in excess of productivity and inflation, you know, by a meaningful amount broadly across the economy, sort of forcing companies to keep raising prices and getting into a wage–price cycle.  That’s, that’s the old formula for—one of the old formulas for having high inflation.  We don’t see anything like that now.  We do see high wages.  We see them for, for people who are mostly new, you know, entering into new jobs, many of them in low-skilled jobs.  And, but we, we do think—you’ve got to—you’ve got to think in the labor market right now, where, where supply and demand are just not matched up well.  And, you know, we think it’s a flexible economy and, and it will clear.  There will—there will be a level at which supply and demand meet.  And that’ll—we think that’ll, that’ll be happening in coming months. So—but the last thing I’ll say is, again, if you look at, at the forecasts, we are going to be in a very strong labor market pretty quickly here.  There are still a big group of unemployed people.  And, you know, we’re not going to forget about them.  We’re going—we’re going to do everything we can to get people back into work and give them the chance to work.  But there’s  June 16, 2021  every reason to think that we’ll be in a—in a labor market with very attractive numbers, with low   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   unemployment, high participation, and rising wages across the spectrum.  So that’s, that’s a little bit how we’re looking at the—at the labor market. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Now we’ll go to Hannah Lang at the American 

[SECTION]

HANNAH LANG.  Hi, I wanted to ask about the status of your thinking around the supplementary leverage ratio right now.  Is the Fed still thinking about ways to permanently adjust this to account for the high growth in deposits?  And do you ultimately believe a permanent fix is needed?  And any information on the timing around that would be—would be Banker. helpful. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  What I can say is, we’re working on it.  I don’t have anything to share with you in terms of the particulars or the timing right now, unfortunately.  But we’ve, we’ve always—our position has been for a long time and, and it is now that we’d, we’d like the leverage ratio to be a backstop to risk-based capital requirements.  When leverage requirements are, are, are binding, it does skew incentives for firms to substitute lower-risk assets for high-risk ones.  It’s a straightforward thing.  And because of the substantial increase in reserves, Treasuries, and other safe assets in the banking system, the SLR is rapidly ceasing to become—ceasing to be the intended backstop for big firms that we want it to be.  So we do think it’s appropriate to consider ways to adapt it to this new high-reserves environment, and, and we’re looking hard at the issue.  We would also, just to be really clear, we will take whatever actions are necessary to assure that any changes we do make or recommend do not erode the overall strength of bank capital requirements.  Sorry, I can’t give you any more.  That’s just something we’re working on.  June 16, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Now we’ll go to Anneken Tappe at CNN Business.  

[SECTION]

ANNEKEN TAPPE.  Hi there.  Thanks for taking my question.  Chairman Powell, the price jumps we’ve seen in some raw materials—lumber, for example, you mentioned that earlier—seem to be easing.  And it looks like we’re at the beginning of suppliers catching up with demand.  But I wonder if you’re worried at all, if we’re going to end up with excess supply immediately after those shortages wear off and if we just continue this mismatch, as we’re recovering and getting out of the pandemic economy.  And I wonder how that would affect the Fed’s outlook at all. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, that is really not the problem we’re having right now.  But—and, actually, people who work in commodity industries are very focused on that, because they know that, you know, they don’t want to build, build capacity and then find out that it’s not necessary.  So, really, the problem now is, is that demand is very, very strong.  Incomes are high, people have money in their bank accounts.  Demand for goods is extremely high, and it hasn’t—it hasn’t come down.  We’re seeing the service sector reopening.  And so you’re seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there. But in terms of, of overcorrecting, I mean, I think there, there is a possibility on the other side of this that, that inflation could be—could actually be quite low going forward.  But that’s not—that’s not really where our focus is right now.  Our focus right now is, we need to—our, our expectation is that these, these high inflation readings that we’re seeing now will start to abate.  And that’s, that’s what we think.  And it’ll be like the lumber experience, and like we expect the used car experience to be.  With things like airplane tickets and hotels, which are the other two factors in the most recent CPI report that went up a lot, we expect that those prices will get back up to where they were, but there’s no reason to think that they’re going to keep going up  June 16, 2021  a lot.  Because if they are, people will build new hotels.  There’s no reason for supply and   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL demand to be out of whack in the hotel business over any period of time.  So we think that’ll happen. I think in terms of the timing and the effects on inflation in the near term, there’s a lot of uncertainty.  The overall story is one that, that we think is right, and we think the incoming data support it and, you know, so do many, many forecasters.  And if you look at the forecasts on the FOMC, you will—you will see that as well.  But we don’t—we don’t in any way dismiss the chance that it can work out that, that this goes on longer than expected.  And the risk would be that over time, it does begin to affect inflation expectations.  And if we see inflation expectations and inflation—or inflation moving up in a way that is really materially above what we—what we would see as consistent with our goals, and persistently so, we wouldn’t hesitate to use our tools to address that.  Price stability is half of our mandate, and we would certainly do that.  We do not expect that, though.  That is not our base case. And, and in that we’re joined by many other forecasters, but there’s a lot to be humble about among forecasters.  Forecasters have a lot to be humble about.  It’s a—it’s a highly uncertain business.  And we’re, we’re very much attuned to the risks and, and watching the data carefully.  In the meantime, I would say, you know, we should—as I mentioned earlier, there’s so much uncertainty around this.  It’s, it’s just a unique situation that we need to see how things evolve in coming months and, and see how that story holds up and act accordingly.

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider, Reuters.  Thanks, Chair Powell, for taking this.  I don’t want to miss the moment here.  And I just—I noticed that in the statement you dropped the language saying that the pandemic is weighing on the economy.  So is this the  June 16, 2021  effective end, in your view, of the pandemic as a constraint on economic activity, even though   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL it’s still cited as a risk? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, it’s a—it’s a continuum, right?  What you’ve seen with the pandemic is sharply declining cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.  And that’s great.  And, and, you know, that should continue.  But, you know, you, you also saw in the United Kingdom, which has, I think, at least as high if not higher vaccination rates, they’ve had an outbreak of the Delta variety.  And it’s—and it’s causing them to have to—to have to react to that.  So you’re not—you’re not out of the woods at this point.  And it would be premature to—in my thinking, it would be premature to declare victory.  Vaccination still has a ways to go to get to levels—it would be good to see it get to a substantially higher level.  And, you know, that can only help. So, look, I—but you’re right, the statement language is evolving.  I would expect it to continue to evolve.  There’s a lot of judgment in that.  But you can expect us to drag our feet a little bit on that, because that’s what you do with statement language.  It’s, it’s great to see the progress.  But, again, I would not declare victory yet.  I would say it is so great to see the reopening of the economy, though, and to see people out living their lives again.  You know, who doesn’t want to see that?  And it appears to be safe, and I just would encourage people to continue to get vaccinated. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  If I could follow up on that, if you—if you view this statement in, in toto and the—and the dots and the substance as well, do you think this is more a developing out there? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I think it’s both.  You know, I think, clearly, since March what’s happened is, people have grown more confident in these very strong outcomes, that they’ll be  June 16, 2021  achieved.  Very strong outcomes in the economy will be achieved.  There’s, there’s more   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL grounds for comfort.  We’ve seen growth coming higher than we expected.  We’ve seen very strong labor demand.  We’ve also seen—we have seen inflation above target, though, and I think even though, you know, in, in our forecasters’ case, they do see inflation coming back down over ’22 and ’23 into, into areas that are very consistent with our—with our mandate.  Nonetheless, the risk is, is something that can factor into people’s thinking about appropriate monetary policy.  The thing is, you know, these are 18 different forecasts, and I can’t stand here and say exactly what was in all 18 people’s minds.  But that, that is something that I think can factor into things as well—factor into our forecast as well. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Victoria Guida with Politico. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I, I wanted to ask a little bit more about inflation to make sure I understand how you’re thinking about this.  So in the projections, inflation is expected to, to be high this year and then come back down next year and then maybe start to rise a little bit again, enough for a liftoff in 2023.  You know, I know that’s obviously—you know, take that with a grain of salt.  But that would suggest that you all could theoretically see inflation sustainably staying above 2 percent.  And so, I guess my question is, what would be causing that inflation?  What, what would be—because it seems like you all now see a situation in which inflation would be rising in a way that isn’t caused by transitory factors in the—in the next couple of years.  So would that be the result of a tight labor market?  Would that be because this whole situation has raised people’s inflation expectations?  How are you thinking about that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So what we’re seeing in the near term—again, our base case is that what we’re seeing in the near term is, is principally associated with, with the reopening of the  June 16, 2021  economy and not with a tight labor market or tight resource constraints, really.  So—but you’re   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   right.  When, when you get to—in, in the forecast, all of that, you know, supply and demand sides of the economy adapt.  We have a very highly adaptive, you know, flexible economy, more so than most.  And by 2023, those increases are really about, about, you know, rising resource utilization or, to put it a different way, you know, low unemployment, or high employment is a way to think about it.  So that’s what that’s about.  That’s about the kind of broad inflationary pressure that results from, you know, a really strong expansion tightening up resource utilization across the whole economy and lifting, lifting up inflation.  And that’s why—that’s why you would see it then, because by then, you know, in the forecast—and it’s just a forecast, they’re just individual forecasts.  In people’s forecasts, that’s what’s happening. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  So the, the, the change in the projections reflect the fact that you all are more optimistic about the economic outlook, and not necessarily that you think that this will change the way people think about inflation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, I think—there may be an element of the latter as well, because inflation expectations have continued to move up.  You know, it’s all in people’s individual thinking, and you can’t—it’s hard to say.  It’s not something the Committee debates in terms of, you know, what, what the outlook is for 2023.  So I’m, I’m a little bit speculating, which I shouldn’t do.  But it wouldn’t surprise me if there’s an element for some people in, you know, seeing the inflation performance that we’ve had and thinking that I have more confidence that we could see inflation above 2 percent, that it may not be as hard to do that as we thought, and that inflation expectations may move up to a—to a level—they were—they were really at a level that was kind of a little below 2 percent.  They might move up as a consequence of this or, or, or as a consequence of, of, of the new framework.  You know, we did see inflation expectations moving  June 16, 2021  up in the—in the wake of the announcement of the framework.  But, you know, we don’t really   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   know that.  So, ultimately, I think it’s consistent with both those things. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Now we’ll go to Greg Robb at MarketWatch. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Hi.  Hi, thank you for taking my question.  Chair Powell, I’m just looking at the forecast, and one thing I just don’t think has been talked about all that much is how much you guys—the Fed thinks that the economy is going to slow next year.  I mean, are we looking at a scenario of a slowing economy next year with higher inflation?  And, and what do you think about that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We’re looking at an economy that will not have the degree of, of fiscal support.  The fiscal support in the forecast is much less than it was this year.  So—but you’ve, you’ve still got a very strong growth, well above the longer-run potential output of the—of the economy.  You’ve got—you’ve got growth meaningfully above that, and inflation is lower next year in all of our—in all of our forecasts.  I think the range of, of core PCE forecast for next year is 1.7 to 2.5 in 2022 and, and 2 to 2.3 in 2023.  So you’re right, you’re seeing—I, I can’t remember the number, but it might be in the 3s—3, 3½ percent growth for next year.  That’s, that’s a really good year—coming on the back of a 7 percent growth year, that’s a really good year.  That’s, that’s a year with a lot of momentum.  That’ll see—you know, that’ll cause significant job creation and, and it will—I mean, we would take 3½ percent.  We didn’t have a 3½ percent growth year—we didn’t have a 3 percent growth year between the Global Financial Crisis and the end of the expansion.  So that would be a good year. 

[SECTION]

GREGG ROBB.  Doesn’t it seem like there’s a risk of, of, you know, like stagflation—where that—you’re going to go from 7 percent and down, that means the economy’s really, you know, dropping in some way.  We haven’t seen that, right?  June 16, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, the economy’s not, not decel—the economy is still growing, and growing at a, at a very healthy rate.  Our estimate—I mean, different people have different estimates—but, broadly speaking, economists think the economy has the potential to grow at around 2 percent per year.  If you’re growing above that, then the unemployment rate should be things should be happening, businesses should be investing. So, you know, I guess to answer your question a different way, is there a risk that inflation will be higher than we think?  Yes.  As I said earlier, you know, we, we don’t have any certainty about the timing or the extent of these effects from reopening.  And therefore we don’t—we don’t think that—we think it’s unlikely that they would materially affect the underlying inflation dynamics that the economy has had for a quarter of a century.  The underlying forces around the globe that have created those dynamics are intact, and those are aging population, low productivity, globalization, all of those things that, that we think have, have, you know, really held down inflation.  All that’s out there still.  You know, when we get through this, we may well—we’ll be facing those same forces.  Nonetheless, is there a risk that inflation will remain higher than we—than we thought?  Yes.  And if, if we see inflation moving above our goals in, in a time—sorry, to an extent, to a level or, or persistently—or persistently enough, you know, we would be prepared to use our tools to address that. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Going to Brian Cheung with Yahoo. 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Chair Powell, Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance.  On that point, you talked about maybe some of the more structural changes in that last answer with regards to productivity.  I noted that the median projection for r*, the longer-term interest rate, is still the same at 2.5 percent.  But there’s been some literature out there that maybe the COVID crisis  June 16, 2021  could have actually changed some of the underlying fundamentals of the economy and maybe   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL changed productivity, in addition to combined with demographic changes that have already been in effect to suggest that that longer-term neutral rate or r* might be higher.  What would the implications of that be for monetary policy?  Do you think that maybe the Fed could have the possibility of underestimating the long-run neutral rate?  And what might be the impact of that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  A higher neutral rate would mean that interest rates would run higher by that amount.  And, and that would be a good thing from the standpoint of the economy, because it would give the Fed more room to cut rates.  The problem with, with interest rates being close to the lower bound, of course, is that it really cuts into our ability to react to a downturn—for example, a pandemic.  And if you look, for example, at the European Central Bank, their, their policy rate was well below zero when, when the pandemic hit.  So we don’t want to be in a place where we can’t react.  A higher neutral rate would, would be—from that narrow standpoint, would be a good thing for us.  It would give us more room and, therefore, then, that would tend to result in better outcomes for the economy over time.  You know, we, it’s—you can’t estimate it with great—with great precision.  I think we would be alert to—I mean, studying r* is a—is a whole industry unto itself.  And I, I think we would be alert to factors that might raise r*, the neutral rate of interest.  And, you know, we, we try to keep up with that.  And I think we’re, we’re, we’re all thinking about that and the possibility of that.  You know, there are many—there are a lot of stories right now that could—that essentially could lead to higher productivity growth and higher r*.  We don’t know which of those stories will come true.  But, I mean, I’ll give you an example.  It’s just there are—there are a lot of start-ups, a lot of early-stage companies.  And is that going to have that effect?  We don’t know.  But we’ll be watching those things carefully.     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Great, thank you.  For the last question, we’ll go to Michael  McKee at Bloomberg TV. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, of course you’ll be shocked to learn that you have some critics on Wall Street.  And I would like to paraphrase a couple of their criticisms and get your reaction to them.  One is that the new policy framework is that you react to actual data and do not react to forecasts, yet the actual inflation data is coming in hot and you’re relying on the forecast that it will cool down in order to make policy.  I wanted to get your view on how you square that.  Another is that you have a long runway, you’ve said, for tapering with announcements.  But if the data keep coming in faster than expected, are you trapped by fear of a taper tantrum from advancing the time period in which you announce a taper?  And, finally, you’ve said the Fed knows how to combat inflation, but raising rates also slows the economy.  And there’s a concern that you might be sacrificing the economy if you wait too long and have to raise rates too quickly. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So that’s a—that’s a few questions there.  So let me say, first, I think people misinterpret the framework.  I think the—there’s nothing wrong with the framework, and there’s nothing in the framework that would in any way, you know, interfere with our ability to pursue our, our goals.  That’s for starters.  All of our discussions and all of our thinking and planning are taking place in the context of our new framework.  We’re strongly committed to it, we think it’s well suited to our goals, including in this—in this unique time.  And I think if you look at the—look at the forecasts that we’ve written down, you know, our Committee is solidly behind them.  The forecasts are all consistent with that. You know, your specific question, I guess, was, will we be behind the curve?  And, you know, that’s, that’s not the situation we’re facing at all.  The situation that we, we addressed in  June 16, 2021  our—in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy was a situation in   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL which employment was at very high levels, but inflation was low.  And what we said was, we wouldn’t raise interest rates just because unemployment was low and employment was high if there was no evidence of inflation or other troubling imbalances.  So that’s what we said. That is not at all the current situation.  In the current situation, we have many millions of people who are unemployed, and we have inflation running well above our target.  The question we face with this inflation has nothing to do with our framework.  It’s a very different, very difficult version of a standard investment—sorry, a central banking question.  And that is, how do you separate in inflation—how do you separate things that, that follow from broad upward price pressures from things that really are a function of, of sort of idiosyncratic factors in a particular—due to particular things?  I mean, a classic example was, to pick a narrow example, was the cellphone price war back in 2017.  If you remember, there was—prices were incredibly low, and it held down core PCE by three-tenths or something for a year, and then it fell out.  So this is much bigger than that.  And, of course, it’s not—it’s not easy to tell in real time which is which, but that’s, that’s the question you would face under, really, any framework.  And, you know, we’re trying to sort that out.  I’ve tried to, to explain that today about how we think about that.  And, you know, we do think that these are temporary factors, and that they’ll wane.  We can’t be absolutely certain about the timing of that, and we’re prepared to use our tools as appropriate. Your second one was?  Oh, you know, we will—we will taper when we feel that the economy has achieved substantial further progress.  And we will communicate very carefully in advance on that.  And that’s what we’re doing.  That’s what we’re going to do, and, and we will follow through on that.  There’s no—I mean, we will do what we can to avoid a market reaction.   June 16, 2021  But, ultimately, when we achieve our macroeconomic goal, we will—we will taper as   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL appropriate. The third thing was—what was the third thing? 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  If you raise rates to control inflation, you also slow the economy.  And the history of the Fed is that sometimes you go too far. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  That’s right.  And we—look, we have to balance the two—the two goals:  maximum employment and price stability.  Often they are—they do pull in the same direction, of course.  But when we—when we raise interest rates to control inflation, there’s no question that has an effect on activity.  And that’s the channel—one of the channels through which we get to inflation.  We don’t think that we’re in a situation like that right now.  We think that the economy is recovering from a deep hole—an unusual hole, actually, because it’s to do with, with shutting down the economy.  It turns out it’s a heck of a lot easier to create demand than it is to, you know, to bring supply back up to snuff.  That’s happening all over the world.  There’s no reason to think that that process will last indefinitely.  But we’re going, you know, we’re going to watch carefully to make sure that, that evolving inflation and our understanding of what’s happening is, is, is right.  And in the meantime, we’ll conduct policy appropriately. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
45,2021-07-28,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and Today the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our asset purchases.  These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete. Progress in vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing strong support to the recovery.  Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in levels. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have shown improvement but have not fully recovered.  Household spending is rising at an especially rapid pace, boosted by the ongoing reopening of the economy and ongoing policy support.  The housing sector remains very strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace.  In some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity.  These constraints are particularly acute in the motor vehicle industry, where worldwide shortages of semiconductors have sharply curtailed production so far this year. As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve.  Demand for labor is very strong, and employment rose 850,000 in June, with the  July 28, 2021  leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains.  Nonetheless, the labor market has   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   a ways to go. The unemployment rate in June—in June was 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year.  Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth.  These factors should wane in coming months, leading to strong gains in employment. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit.  In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and Hispanics. Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating.  As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly production can respond in the near term.  These bottleneck effects have been larger than anticipated, but as these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer-run goal.  Very low readings from early in the pandemic as well as the pass-through of past increases in oil prices to consumer energy prices also contribute to the increase, although these base effects and energy effects are receding. The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic.  As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that  July 28, 2021  inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect.  Our new framework for   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well-anchored inflation expectations, both to, to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal. Indicators of long-term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.  If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we’d be prepared to adjust the stance of policy. The effects of the pandemic on the economy have continued to diminish, but risks to the economic outlook remain.  Progress on vaccinations has limited the spread of COVID-19.  However, the pace of vaccinations has slowed, and the Delta strain of the virus is spreading quickly in some areas.  Continued progress on vaccinations would support a return to more normal economic conditions. The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.  We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions achieved.  July 28, 2021  have reached level—levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, we are continuing to—continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  Our asset purchases have been a critical tool.  They helped preserve financial stability and market functioning early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster accommodative financial conditions to support the economy. At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee continued to discuss the progress made toward our—toward our goals since the Committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last December.  We also reviewed some considerations around how our asset purchases might be adjusted, including their pace and composition, once economic conditions warrant a change.  Participants expect that the economy will continue to move toward our standard of  “substantial further progress.”  In coming meetings, the Committee will again assess the economy’s progress toward our goals, and the timing of any change in the pace of our asset purchases will depend on the incoming data.  As we’ve said, we will provide advance notice before making any changes to our purchases. On a final note, we announced the establishment of two standing repo facilities, a domestic one for primary dealers and additional banks and another for foreign and international monetary authorities.  These facilities will serve as backstops in money markets to support the effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning.  July 28, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Steve Liesman with CNBC. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you very much.  Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you might be able to put some, I don’t know, numbers or maybe more detail around this concept of “substantial further progress.”  What counts as the progress numerically, if you will, or, or, or citing data, if you could, that you cited in the statement today?  And if you could be more specific about what substantial further progress would look like and if that would then lead you to an announcement of an actual reduction in the purchases of your assets.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Great.  Thank you.  So more detail on substantial further progress.  So let’s talk about the maximum-employment part of that.  As you know, with maximum employment—unlike with, with price stability, where we can target a number of 2 percent on average—with maximum employment, there isn’t a single number that we can target.  That the—we monitor a broad range of, of, of data about different aspects of the labor market.  There’s unemployment, unemployment among different, different age groups, and such.  There’s participation.  There’s wages.  There’s all kinds of flow data.  And we look at all of it to try to arrive at a picture of what—of what is maximum employment. So there isn’t—I can’t give you a, a, a set of numbers—for example, a numerical threshold like we used for a time back in 2012, I guess it was.  We didn’t do that here.  What we said was substantial further progress toward our goals.  And what we said was, we would keep,  July 28, 2021  effectively, we’d—we would give advance warning as we—and, and, you know, more and more   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   clarity—as, as we move forward.  And that’s what we’re going to try to do. So what would substantial further progress be?  I’d say we have some ground to cover on, on the labor market side.  I think we’re, we’re some way away from, from having had substantial further progress with, with max—toward the maximum-employment goal.  I would want to see some strong job numbers.  And, and that’s, that’s kind of the idea. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  If, if I could follow up, you talked about one side of the equation.  You didn’t—does it mean you feel like you’ve reached your goal when it comes to the inflation side?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So inflation is running well above our 2 percent objective and has been for a few months and is expected to run up certainly above our objective for a few months before we believe it’ll, it’ll move back down toward our objective.  The question whether we’ve met that objective formally is really one for the Committee to make.  I can’t—I can’t do that by myself.  But it’s clear that, at this time, inflation is actually running above 2 percent.  And, and, again, has been and will be, at least we expect it will, in coming months before returning down toward our target.

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, yes.  We can hear you. 

[SECTION]

ANN SAPHIR.  I apologize.  I—just to follow up on the question, I want to ask, you know, is it—is it correct to see this as the, the start of the advance notice process, you know, sorry.  July 28, 2021  before a taper?  And, and, and also, can you speak to how the recent surge in COVID factors into   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   your thinking on, on the taper?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, as you know, we’re, we’re in a process now where what we said is that as—at this meeting and in coming meetings, we’re going to be continuing to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals and give advance notice.  We’ll be—try to provide additional clarity about our thinking, both in the—in the postmeeting statement and in the minutes and in the public comments that people make. You know, our, our approach here has been to be as transparent as we can.  We have not reached substantial further progress yet.  So we’re, we’re not there, and we see our ways as having some—we see ourselves as having some ground to cover to get there.  So that’s what I would say. In terms of—in terms of, of COVID and the Delta strain, I’ll say a couple things.  Of course, it will have significant health consequences for many.  And we need to keep that in mind before we start—before we mention and move to the economic questions.  This is a—rising cases in, in a number of parts of the country, and some forecasts are for them to rise quite significantly.  We’ll see. What we’ve seen, though, is with successive waves of, of COVID over the past year and some months now, there has tended to be less economic—less in the way of economic implications from each wave.  And we will see whether that is the case with the Delta variety.  But it’s, you know, it’s a—it’s certainly a—not an unreasonable expectation. So it, it certainly is plausible if people would pull back from some activities because of the risk of infection.  Dining out, traveling, schools might—some schools might not reopen.  We  July 28, 2021  the labor market.  Some people might choose—again, we, we don’t have a strong sense of how   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL that might work out, so we’ll just be monitoring it—monitoring it carefully. 

[SECTION]

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.  In your opening statements in March and April, you noted that a transitory rise in inflation above 2 percent this year would not meet the threshold of moderately exceeding 2 percent for some time, and I noticed you didn’t repeat that qualification last month or today.  And, and so, in your view, has the rise in inflation this year met the threshold of moderately exceeding 2 percent for some time? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  That, that would, again, be a question for the Committee.  But I would really say, the guidance that you’re talking about is really the guidance to do with liftoff, right?  That’s—what the guidance is for liftoff, we had to have labor market conditions consistent with full employment, inflation at 2 percent and on track to run—to run moderately above 2 percent for some time.  It really isn’t relevant now.  It—because we’re really—we’re looking at, at tapering asset purchases. We’re clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates.  It’s not something that, that is on our radar screen right now.  You know, so when we get to that question, when we start to get to the question of, of liftoff, which, which we are not at all at now or near now, that’s when we’ll ask that question.  That is when that, that will become a real question for us. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Jeanna Smialek at the New York Times. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you for taking our questions.  I wonder if you could talk a little bit about [inaudible] reacting [inaudible].  You know, does that affect,  July 28, 2021  affect how you’re thinking about tapering?  Does it affect how you’re thinking about, you know,   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   potential liftoff down the road?  And if you could, just talk a little bit about that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Jeanna, I’m sorry.  For the first 15 seconds of your question, you froze.  Could you—could you say that again?  I apologize.  

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Oh, yes.  No.  Sorry.  Yes.  So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how the divergence in global growth and the sort of multispeed recovery we’re seeing around the world impacts how the Fed thinks about its policies.  So do you take into account that sort of multispeed recovery when you’re thinking about tapering QE, and do you take, take it into account when you’re thinking about liftoff? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks.  So it’s an—it’s an important feature of this recovery is how uneven it is.  And, in many cases, that’s related to the fact that some countries have had little in the way of access to, to vaccines.  And so they’re seeing significant outbreaks, and it’s weighing on economic activity, whereas other countries—such as the United States, in particular—are having a very strong rebound.  And, and now Europe is having a stronger rebound as well. So it’s a feature of our economy.  Now, how does it affect our policy?  In, in a couple of ways, potentially.  One just is that, in general, economies—and through financial markets and through trade—are, are deeply interconnected now.  And so a stronger global economy will lead to more U.S. exports.  And, and, you know, that’ll help economic activity.  To the extent the global economy is weak and the United States is strong, it’ll—we’ll wind up, you know, we’ll wind up exporting some of our demand through, through imports rather than having, having a lot of exports.  That’s one way. Another way, though, is more on the risk side.  And that is, as long as COVID is running loose out there, as long as there’s time and space for the development of new strains, no one’s  July 28, 2021  really finally safe.  These, these strains—there’s no reason they just can’t keep coming and one,   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   you know, one more powerful than the next.  We don’t know that.  But that’s, that’s, that’s certainly a plausible outcome.  Now, as, as vaccinations rise, we can nonetheless get back to our economic activity.  But, you know, it, it is both the right thing to do and, and very much in our interest to make sure that vaccination happens broadly around the world, just for that reason. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  James at the FT. 

[SECTION]

JAMES POLITI.  Thank you very much.  Chair Powell, how would you describe the risks to the outlook on inflation at the moment after the last data came out higher than expected?  Do you believe the risks are, you know, tilted to the upside?  And does the Committee share that view?  Or are they in balance?  Are you still worried that there could be a hit to demand from, from the Delta variant that could tilt them sort of to the downside again?  If you could give us a sense of that, that would be very helpful. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  I’d be glad to.  So if you look, again, if you look at the, the most recent inflation report, what you see is that it came in significantly higher than expected.  But essentially all of the overshoot can be tied to a handful of categories.  It isn’t the kind of inflation that’s spread broadly across the economy.  It’s new, used, and rental cars.  It’s airplane tickets.  It’s hotels.  And it’s a couple of other things.  And each of those has a story attached to it that is—that is really about the reopening of the economy. So we look at that, and we think that those are temporary things because the, the supply side will respond.  The economy will adapt.  We have a very adaptive, adaptable, flexible economy and labor market.  And it’s a real—a real asset that we have.  And so we think that inflation should move down over time.  Now, we don’t have any—much confidence, let’s say, in the timing of that or the size of the effects in the near term.  I would say, in the near term, that  July 28, 2021  the, the, the risks to inflation are probably to the upside.  I, I, I have some confidence in the—in   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   the medium term, that inflation will move back down.  Again, it’s hard to say when that will be. I, I, I will say, though, that, you know, we—inflation is half of our mandate.  Price stability is half of our mandate.  And if we were to see inflation moving up to levels persistently that were—that were above, significantly, materially above our goal and particularly if inflation expectations were to move up, we would use our tools to guide inflation back down to 2 percent. So we won’t have an extended period of, of high inflation.  We think that, that some of it will, will fall away naturally as the process of reopening the economy moves through.  And it could take some time.  In any case, we will use our tools over time as appropriate to make sure that we do have inflation that averages 2 percent over time. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Victoria at Politico. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  So bond market pricing seems to suggest that investors think the Fed might eventually overtighten.  So my question is, do you think that managing inflation concerns? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so in terms of what’s been happening in bond markets, I don’t think there’s a real consensus on, on what explains the moves between the last meeting and this meeting.  We’ve seen the long-term yields go down significantly.  Some of it is a fall in real yields, which may have been connected to—some speculate—connected to sentiment around the, the spread of the Delta variant and concern about growth. There was also some decline in inflation compensation, which has significantly reversed.  And there, there are also so-called technical factors, which is where you put things that you can’t quite explain.  So I, I, I don’t see in any of that that there is really anything that challenges the  July 28, 2021  credibility of our framework, if, if that’s really your question.  We are committed to achieving   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL 2 percent average inflation over time. What we said was that, in particular, when we see a very strong labor market, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, that won’t be enough for us to raise interest rates until we see some inflation.  Of course, what we have today is kind of the opposite.  We’ve got, you know, 7 or 8 million people, fewer people, at work than were at work before the pandemic.  So we’re, you know, we’re, we’re a ways away from full maximum employment.  But we have high inflation, so it’s kind of the opposite case.  And we have to—we have to deal with that. Any central bank has to deal with that by looking at the inflation and asking whether it is broad based and likely to be persistent and, and, and whether inflation expectations are implicated in a way that, that could cause them to rise.  So we’re monitoring that very carefully, and we’re prepared to use our tools as appropriate.  But, again, I think our—I think our framework is pretty well understood.  And, and I think the real test of it will be down the road when it’s time to think about raising interest rates and, and how we assess, assess that set of issues. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Rich at Bloomberg. 

[SECTION]

RICH MILLER.  Thanks very much, Michelle.  Chairman Powell, you, you just alluded to the fact that you’re prepared to use your tools to slow the economy down if need be to—if inflation looks like it’s getting out of control.  I want to just try to understand that in the context of the framework and the forward guidance.  Does that mean you’d be prepared to raise interest rates even if we’re not at maximum employment at that point, should you see this danger of inflation?  And, and, two, does it also mean you’d be prepared to raise interest rates even if you are still buying assets?  Thank you.  July 28, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So there’s a—there’s a part in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and, and Monetary Policy Strategy, which, Rich, I’m sure—I’m sure you’re familiar with, which, which talks about that case in which the two goals are in tension.  Most of the time, if you have high inflation, you also have high employment—they, they tend to go together.  This is a situation where they’re temporarily in different directions.  We’re not at full employment, but we are having high inflation. We feel like we’re going to be making good progress over the next—over the course of the next year, couple of years, really, toward maximum employment.  This is a very strong labor it’s—we’re, we’re clearly on a path to a very strong labor market with high participation, low unemployment, high employment, wages moving up across the spectrum.  That, that’s, that’s the path that we’re on, and, and it shouldn’t take that long in macroeconomic time to get there. So that’s, that’s what I think is, is really the likely case.  And, again, it’s not—it’s not timely for us to be thinking about, about raising interest rates right now.  What we’re doing is, we’re, we’re looking at our asset purchases and judging what is right for the economy and judging how we—how close we are to substantial further progress and then—and then tapering after that. The question you asked about, would we raise rates if we hadn’t finished cutting—hadn’t finished the taper, hypothetical question.  You know, we’d, we’d face the circumstance at the time.  We could always just—you know, one thing one could do would be to just cut asset purchases all the way to zero if you wanted to do that.  But it’s, it’s, it’s just hard to—it’s hard to answer what you would do without knowing a lot more about the situation.  Ideally, you wouldn’t be still buying assets and raising rates because, of course, you’re adding  July 28, 2021  accommodation by buying and, and removing accommodation by raising rates.  So that wouldn’t   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   be ideal.  I’ll say that. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Edward Lawrence at Fox Business. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  So thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question.  Now, so you’re talking about jobs.  You just said we’re on a path to a very strong job market.  You know, we have 9.5 million people unemployed as of the last labor gap?  Is it the extended unemployment benefits?  Is it the fact that people just aren’t willing to relocate?  What is the disconnect there? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  It’s a—it’s a really unusual situation to have—to have the ratio of vacancies to unemployed be this high.  And we think there are a number of things at work there.  their old jobs.  It’s about finding a new job.  So that’s a time-intensive, labor-intensive process. And there may be a bit of a speed limit on that.  There, there’s research that suggests that there is a speed limit on that.  So it’s not like you can have millions of people at the beginning of the recovery going back in a single month because they’re just going back to their old job.  This is about job selection, things like that.  There may also be some factors that are—that are holding people back, and that’s—this is what surveys say.  There are people who, who are reluctant to go back to work because they still feel exposed to COVID.  These could be jobs where, where there was a lot of, of interaction with the public and where perhaps there’s a family member who’s vulnerable or for whatever reason. There’s also caretakers who are—where, where schools are not fully open and parents are at home or taking care of, of, of older people.  And there’s also been very generous  July 28, 2021  unemployment benefits, which are now rolling off.  They’ll be—they’ll be fully rolled off in a   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL couple of months.  And all of those factors should, should wane.  And, you know, we, we think we should see, because of that, we should see strong job creation moving forward. I mean, ultimately, it’s unusual to see aspects like the job openings number in a context where there are that many unemployed people.  That many job openings would typically suggest a tight labor market.  And, of course, we hear from businesses all over the country that it’s very hard to hire people.  And that may be because people, people are shopping carefully for their next job.  I mean, I, I, I think the bottom line on this is, people want to work.  If you look at where labor force participation can get, people will go back to work unless they retire.  Some people will retire.  But, generally speaking, Americans want to work, and, and they’ll find their way into the jobs that they want.  It may take some time, though. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Rachel Siegel at the Washington Post. 

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Thank you, Michelle.  And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions.  I wanted to follow up on what you said about there tending to be less in the way of economic implications from each wave of COVID cases.  Could you elaborate on what you’ve seen to that end during previous waves?  And then, looking forward, how vulnerable is the labor I’m thinking or wondering if you have concerns that jobs that may have come back in travel or tourism could be susceptible if people started reconsidering their travel plans or if caretakers were suddenly faced with the prospect of schools not reopening.  How do you see some of those risks going forward?  Thank you so much. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So if you remember the, the summer wave last year of COVID, which was largely southern and western states, the economy just performed much better  July 28, 2021  than anyone expected.  You know, we, we were coming off the spring wave, where there were a   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   lot of shutdowns.  And then this big second wave hit, and I think the natural thing to do is to expect that, that it would have a real impact on the economy.  And it was much less than, than people thought. People—what’s happened is, first of all, many people are vaccinated.  They’re going on with their lives.  Secondly, we’ve kind of learned to live with it.  A lot of industries have, have kind of improvised their way around it—particularly, for example, buying a new home.  That, that process of buying a new home very quickly moved to much more of a virtual process.  And so they were able to, you know, to, to do that.  And other industries as well have gone to take-out and, you know, no-contact things.  It’s—so that can all—it seems like we’ve learned to, to handle this. Now, I think people would like to get back to, to, you know, the way things were.  And I, I, I hope to some extent, we will over time.  You know, of course, the big wave we had last winter did have significant employment effects, particularly in, you know, hospitality and leisure and other entertainment—other, other areas with a lot of direct contact.  A lot of jobs were lost then because that was a very strong wave that happened in, in, in the winter months last year, just before the vaccines arrived. So with Delta, we’re just going to have to watch.  Again, with, with, with a reasonably high percentage of the country vaccinated and the vaccine apparently being effective—we’re not experts on this—but it, it seems like the—a good—a good going-in estimate would be that the effects will probably be less.  There probably won’t be significant lockdowns and things like that.  But, again, those, those are not decisions for us or, or, or—nor is it something we’re be—we’d be expert in.  July 28, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL In terms of the, the, the channels, you know, I—this is—this is kind of speculation, but it’s pretty—it just is that people, you could imagine school districts deciding to wait a month or two for the—for the—for the Delta wave to go.  I’m not saying this’ll happen, but that it’s easy to imagine that.  It’s also easy to imagine that some people might say, you know what?  I’m just going to—I’m just going to wait a couple of months before going back to work.  Wouldn’t be hard to imagine that happening. If, if schools don’t open, then caretakers have to stay home.  And if people don’t go back into the labor force, then the job growth won’t be as strong, those kinds of things.  So I don’t—it doesn’t—it doesn’t—again, sitting here today, not being able to really know the future—it doesn’t seem as though the effects will be very large.  But there may be effects.  And they—it are many parts of the country where it might not have an effect, and we’re just going to have to, to see what the economic effects are. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Now we’ll go to David Gura at NPR. 

[SECTION]

DAVID GURA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was going to ask if you’ve started drafting your Jackson Hole speech, but I’m going to go in a—in a different direction here.  Steve Liesman asked you about semantics.  I’m going to take a cue from him and ask you about the term “transitory,” because I think of you as somebody who’s so lucidly explained policies and programs in recent months and made a real concerted effort to explain them to, to the American public as a whole.  I wonder about this term and what you would say to people who don’t know it definitionally, don’t know what it means, and see prices going up and wonder how long they’re going to have to wait.  July 28, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL So just some broader definition from you—I’d like to hear just about what it means or how you understand it.  And, and quickly as well, you’ve talked about vaccines a bit.  And your colleague in Minneapolis has placed a mandate on vaccinating employees coming back to that Federal Reserve Bank.  And I wonder if that’s something that you would like to see or expect to see Systemwide going forward. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  The concept of “transitory” is really this:  It is that the increases will happen.  We’re not saying they will reverse.  That’s not what “transitory” means.  It means that the increases in prices will happen, so there will be inflation but that the process of inflation will stop so that—so that there won’t be further—when, when we think of inflation, we really think of inflation going up year upon year upon year upon year.  That’s inflation. When you have inflation for 12 months or whatever it might be—I’m just taking an example; I’m not making an estimate—then, then you have a price increase, but you don’t have an inflation process.  And so part of that just is that, if it doesn’t affect longer-term inflation expectations, then it’s very likely not to infect—to affect the process of inflation going forward. So what, what I mean by “transitory” is just something that doesn’t leave a permanent know, producers are going to take those price increases back.  That’s, that’s not the idea.  It’s just that they won’t go on indefinitely.  So to the extent people are, are, are implementing price increases because raw materials are going up or labor costs or something’s going up, you know, the question, really, for inflation really is, does that mean they’re going to go up the next year by the same amount? So you’re going to be in a process where inflation, the inflation process, gets going.  And, and that happens because people’s expectations about future inflation move up.  And we don’t  July 28, 2021  think that’s happening.  There’s no evidence that it’s happening.  All the evidence is that it’s not   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   happening.  But, nonetheless, we have to watch this very carefully because this is—you know, we have two mandates:  maximum employment and price stability.  Price stability, for us, means inflation averaging 2 percent over time.  And so we’ve got to be very careful about that. But, but I, I, I think it’s a good point that it’s, it’s a term—what it really means is temporary.  But then you’ve got to understand that it doesn’t mean that the—that the increases will be taken back.  Some of them will be, but, but that’s not really what it means. In terms of—so we’re, we’re working virtually here, and we’ll be coming back down the road in a couple of months, starting to bring people back here at the Board of Governors in Washington.  And, you know, we’re going to follow public health guidance and things like that.  We really haven’t made the fundamental decisions about exactly what that will look like.  And it’ll depend on, to some extent, on what—on what, you know, CDC guidance looks like when we actually do bring people back in. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Chairman, I wanted to ask you a little bit about your taper timeline in the sense that you said you want a couple more months of data.  And the statement says that the Fed is going to use—to, to evaluate the developments in the two markets, in jobs and inflation, in coming meetings.  Does that suggest that we wouldn’t see anything before basically felt you’re going to lay out your taper plans at Jackson Hole.  Is that—is that the plan, or are we not going to see anything until the fall? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So in any decisions about the timing, and I did not—if I—if I said we’re looking at wanting a couple more months of data, I wasn’t—I’m not meaning to suggest  July 28, 2021  anything about a particular time at which we might taper, because we really have not made that   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   views on, on what timing will be appropriate.  And those views ultimately track, track back to people’s views about the economy and, and what will happen as we make progress towards, towards our—towards our goal. So that’s, that’s really what it is.  And I, I—we will, of course, as we—you know, we’re going to continue to try to provide clarity as appropriate on, on timing, pace, and composition.  But, today, I’ve, I’ve given you what I can give you because, again, this, this was the first, really, I would say, deep dive on the issues of timing, pace, and composition.  And it was a good meeting.  And—but no decisions are made, and, and I’m just not in a position to, to give you much guidance, really any guidance, on the actual timing. I—but I will say we’re making progress.  We expect further progress.  And we expect that, if, if things go well, then we will—we will reach that goal.  And when we reach it and the Committee is comfortable that we have reached it, then, then we’ll taper at that point.  I can’t, I really—there’s nothing I can say about Jackson Hole.  You know, I’m in—we’re in the process of writing that speech.  And I am going to give a speech, and—but I, I, I wouldn’t want to—I wouldn’t want to say what will be in there at this point. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Well, if I could follow up, several people have recently noted that the Fed has got the markets working well.  And you’ve got bank loans up.  In other words, you’ve stimulated demand.  But savers and companies, like insurance companies and pension funds, are getting hammered by the low rates.  And they’re wondering if the balance hasn’t started to shift away from benefiting the economy to doing more harm than good.  July 28, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We—asset purchases were just a key part of our response to the critical phase of the crisis.  They, they really helped us restore market function to these key global economy.  And then they were a big part of, of creating accommodative financial conditions to support demand.  They were strongly needed. It was that commitment to continue asset purchases that provided strong support for the economy and, and has been a part of the story for why the economy is so strong right now.  So we said we would taper when we—when we achieve substantial further progress.  And, and, you know, we’re going to honor that commitment.  I mean, it’s—and, and, again, we’re talking about it right now and meeting by meeting and, and moving in that direction.  We will taper when we reach that goal.  And we’ll provide more, you know, more clarity on that as we go, as is appropriate. Thanks. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker. 

[SECTION]

HANNAH LANG.  Hi.  You’ve been asked a lot previously if the Fed’s monetary policy at all contributes to inequality, but I was really curious to know where you think the Fed’s regulatory policy lands, particularly if you think that the Fed’s bank capital requirements have had the effect of penalizing lower-income households seeking loans.  Basically, is it possible to achieve the balance of a safe banking system with one that also provides equitable loan access?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think strong capital requirements are essential for banks, particularly for the largest banks.  And I think that an undercapitalized banking system, as we’ve seen, can be a real threat to the economy and most—mostly, or to, to the greatest extent, to  July 28, 2021  people at the lower end of the income spectrum.  So if you look back at not this previous—not   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL this crisis but the previous one, the bank—the banking system was undercapitalized. So higher capital requirements are, are, you know, are, are really a good thing because they allow banks to weather downturns and continue to perform the functions that they perform.  I think it’s other tools that we have to—and the Fed has some of these tools, Congress has some of these tools, other agencies have some of these tools—to assure or support the wide availability of credit, particularly to low- and moderate-income communities. So that’s CRA.  We enforce CRA.  We’re working on a—on a new CRA proposal right now with the other banking agencies, and we think it’s going to be—it’s going to be good and will support the flow of credit to low- and moderate-income households.  It’s also the anti—anti–lending discrimination statutes that we enforce.  And it’s some of the programs that Congress has in place to support the flow of credit to low- and moderate-income communities.  I, I don’t think it’s capital standards at all.  I think capital standards work the other way.  Strong capital is what enables banks to continue to serve their communities, including low- and moderate-income communities. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Chris Rugaber at the AP. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi.  Thank you for taking my question.  Chair Powell, I guess I wanted to ask about the last—when you were before Congress earlier this month, you mentioned, I think, something along the lines of, it won’t take too long before we see if you’re right about inflation and its temporary aspect.  You also mentioned learning a lot more in the next six months about the economy.  Can you tell us a little more of what you mean by that?  When do you think you’ll get a clean reading on inflation that is free of most of the distortions that we’re seeing now?  July 28, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So with inflation, as I mentioned, we’re, we look not just at the headline number, but we look at all the components that go into the calculation of inflation.  And if you do that, if you look under the hood, what you see is not that, widely, across the whole range of goods and services that, that are in the economy, we’re seeing upward, upward pressure on prices.  That’s not really what we’re seeing. What we’re seeing is a handful of things that are really—that really account for the, the overshoot of inflation.  And, as I mentioned, it’s things like cars.  You know, new, used, and rental cars have moved up in price because of the car shortage because of the semiconductor shortage.  And housing—sorry, hotels and air, air fares have moved back up, but that really just is retracing the very large downward movement in prices that they had before. So that’s, that’s a big, big part of, of why the inflation readings are so high.  And those don’t—those, frankly, don’t carry significant implications in the long run for the—for inflation or for the American economy.  So what I said was, we, we’re going to see whether these things—we don’t need to see everything do what lumber prices have done.  So if you look at lumber prices, they went up and then they went down. So what we want to see is these other things.  Do they—do they—do the prices flatten out?  Do they actually move down?  If they flatten out, then their, their contribution to inflation becomes zero over time so that they’re not contributing to inflation.  And so, if we start to see those things happen fairly widely among the—among the things that have really moved up quickly, then we’ll, we’ll—they won’t all happen at once or happen quickly—but we’ll know that our basic understanding of the situation is broadly correct. And I don’t think it will take, or what I said was, I don’t think it’ll take a very long time to see whether that’s the case.  It, it, it is probably the case that, frankly, the, the overall  July 28, 2021  reopening of the economy is going to play out over a period of time.  This is a historic, world   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL historical event, that the global economy is now reopening.  It’s not going to—it’s not going to happen quickly.  It’s going to take some time. And it’s going to be very uneven, as we discussed before.  But I think we will—we will know, you know, when we know.  But I don’t think it will take that long.  I don’t want to put a number on it.  But I do think that, that, if we see those things happening, we’ll know that we have the story basically right.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo Finance. 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance.  I’m just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of how you’re thinking about mortgage-backed securities purchases as you inch towards taper.  Within the context of home prices continuing to rise, we’ve heard a lot of people talk about the idea that maybe they’d like to cool off on, specifically, the MBS purchases.  Is that more because of the optics, or is it because there’s an observed relationship from the Committee’s view between MBS purchases under QE and the hot housing market?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So a number of participants raised that—the questions around MBS and tapering at, at today’s meeting, as a matter of fact, and yesterday’s meeting.  And I’ll just say that, generally speaking, I don’t think and—I don’t think that—I think that Treasury and MBS purchases affect financial conditions in very similar ways.  There may be modest differences in terms of, of contribution to housing prices, but it’s, it’s not something that’s big. It’s not—it’s—so where I think we are is, there, there really is little support for the idea of tapering MBS earlier than Treasuries.  I think we will taper them at the same time.  It seems likely, based on where people are now.  The idea of reducing MBS purchases at a somewhat  July 28, 2021  faster pace than Treasuries does have some attraction for some people—others, not so much.    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL And I think it’s something that we’ll be continuing to discuss. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Michael Derby. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Thank you very much.  So I wanted to ask you about the standing repo facility and get your sense of what you think it will do for market trading conditions.  And also, kind of in a similarly related point, the reverse repo numbers have just gotten even bigger since you raised the reverse repo rate at the last Fed meeting.  And, you know, are you concerned to see, you know, nearly $1 trillion a day, you know, pouring in through that facility? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So on the standing repo facility, what is it going to do?  So it, it really is a backstop.  So it’s, it’s set at 25 basis points, so out of the money, and it’s, it’s there to help address pressures in money market—money markets that could impede the effective implementation of monetary policy.  So, really, it’s, it’s to support the function of—functioning of monetary policy and its, its effectiveness.  That’s the purpose of it.  And it’s set up with that purpose in mind. Your question on, on the, the [ON]RRP, so we think it’s doing what it’s supposed to do, what we expect of it to do, which is to help provide a floor for money market rates and help ensure that the federal funds, funds rate stays within the target range.  You know, it’s essentially, essentially, what’s happening is that it just results in a lower aggregate amount of Federal Reserve liabilities that are in banks in the form of reserves and a higher amount of Federal Reserve liabilities in money market funds in the form of overnight RRP balances. So that, that’s all that’s really happening there.  And we expect it to be high for some time.  It’s being driven, of course, by, by the relatively lower quantity of Treasury bills and, and,  July 28, 2021  and also the onset of the debt ceiling and the decline in the TGA, things like that.  So we don’t—  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   we don’t have a problem with, with what it’s doing.  It’s kind of doing the job we expected. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  And you don’t see any issues with, like, disaggregating, you know, that the Fed’s footprint in money markets is getting too big, you don’t see any issues there? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Not, not really.  Not at this point.  I mean, money markets, private money market funds are, are choosing to, to invest because the rates are attractive.  At some point, the rates will not be so attractive as, as the whole rate cluster normalizes, and, and you’ll see it shrink back down. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Okay.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thanks.  Let’s go to Greg Robb at MarketWatch. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  Chair Powell, I was going to go back to inflation a little bit.  I’m just kind of surprised by your tone.  It, it seems like you’re just sort of warning that, if inflation gets too high, you know, the Fed will act.  Isn’t it true that, I mean, a little inflation is good for the economy and, and that we—if somehow maybe we can get the economy out of this sort of place where we’re always going to be close to the zero lower bound, isn’t there a good story to tell, and you’re sort of panicking people? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I certainly don’t, don’t have that in mind.  No.  Look, we—as you know, we’re targeting a moderate overshoot of 2 percent inflation for some time.  We, we want inflation expectations to be centered on, on 2 percent.  We feel like they may be a little bit below that.  So the bigger picture is that, you know, that, that, that would be a healthy thing.  This is a different thing.  This is—this is not that.  That was the kind of inflation we were thinking about that comes from, you know, from a very, very strong labor market and a—and a booming  July 28, 2021  economy maybe.  That, that was the kind of inflation—this, this is something different.  This is   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL really driven by the supply side, which is not able to hand—to handle this big spike in demand that we’re seeing.  As the economy reopens with vaccination and fiscal support and monetary policy support, the supply side—just all over the world, you’re seeing the same thing, which is, it just can’t keep up.  And there are labor shortages in, in a lot of places, the same sort of thing. So, you know, there’s, there’s absolutely no sense of panic.  I just—I’ve explained, I think, several times here today that the best—my, my best estimate is that this is something that will pass.  It’s really a shock to the economy that will pass through.  And, you know, if you—if you look at where forecasters are—people who actually write down a forecast for a living—very, very strongly they see it that way. Now, we—but, you know, are—we’re actually responsible for this, though, so we have to take seriously the risk, the risk case, which is that inflation will be more persistent, that it might actually move inflation expectations up, and that we might—that the kind of things that might require a response.  We, again, we don’t see that now.  But we, we have to be on the alert for it.  And people have to understand and believe that we will react if, if we need to.  And we will. But, again, it’s not—it’s not my base case.  My base case is that—is, as I’ve said repeatedly, is that inflation will move back down.  And no, we’re not—we, we have not at all changed our view, and I haven’t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent, moderately above 2 percent, is a desirable thing.  This is not moderately above 2 percent.  This is well above 2 percent.  But it’s also not the kind of inflation we were looking for.  This is really driven by a supply-side shock. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you.     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Don Lee at the Los Angeles Times for the  last question. 

[SECTION]

DON LEE.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I wonder if you could talk about wages.  Many workers seem to have gotten some good wage gains in, in recent months.  What can workers generally expect going forward?  And it doesn’t sound like you’re concerned about rising wages feeding into broader inflation.  Is that right? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So wages have moved up.  A lot of that is driven by new hires.  And it’s—a lot of it is driven at relatively low-paid jobs in the service industries as people come back.  So that’s not troubling.  And we, we don’t see—there, there is a form of wage inflation that can lead to price inflation, and we’re not seeing that right now. And that really is if what we call “unit labor costs” move up and, and, and, which really puts—move up in a way that is—that is hard for companies to manage and puts them in a situation where they have to accept substantially lower margins or raise prices.  Now, when it happens gradually, when that—if you—we’ve seen in a long expansion, sometimes unit labor costs do move up and, and put some pressure on margins.  In a long expansion, that’s been happening late in the expansion.  That’s not a problem, either. The problem is if it happens in a way that pushes firms broadly into raising prices.  It was called the “wage–price spiral.”  We don’t see that now.  This is something that was a feature of the high inflationary era of the Great Inflation, but it’s not a feature now.  And we don’t see that now.  Of course, we’ll be watching it. And this is one of the reasons why we’re watching so carefully to see whether labor force—whether people do come back and accept jobs.  Given the very large number of job openings and the very large number of unemployed people, we’d like to see, you know, those— July 28, 2021  some matching going on there so people get back to work.  We think labor supply would be—  Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL would be a healthy thing.  You know, but wages moving up across the spectrum, consistent with inflation and productivity, is a—is a good thing. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  And thank you all.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
46,2021-09-22,"CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability. Today, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our current pace of asset purchases.  These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete. Progress on vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing strong support to the recovery.  Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen.  Real GDP rose at a robust 6.4 percent pace in the first half of the year, and growth is widely expected to continue at a strong pace in the second half.  The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the rise in COVID-19 cases has slowed their recovery.  Household spending rose at an especially rapid pace over the first half of the year but flattened out in July and August as spending softened in COVID-sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants.   Additionally, in some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity.  These constraints are particularly acute in the motor vehicle industry, where the worldwide shortage of semiconductors has sharply curtailed production.  Partly reflecting the effects of the virus and supply constraints, forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised somewhat lower since our June Summary of Economic Projections, but participants still foresee rapid growth.  September 22, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve.  Demand for labor is very strong, and job gains averaged 750,000 per month over the past three months.  In August, however, job gains slowed markedly, with the slowdown concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality.  The unemployment rate was 5.2 percent in August, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year.   Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing fears of the virus, appear to be weighing on employment growth.  These factors should diminish with progress on containing the virus, leading to more rapid gains in employment.  Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.8 percent at the end of this year and 3.5 percent in 2023 The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit.  In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and ’24. and Hispanics. Inflation is elevated and will likely remain so in coming months before moderating.  As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly production can respond in the near term.  These bottleneck effects have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, leading to upward revisions to participants’ inflation projections for this year.  While these supply effects are prominent for now, they will abate, and as they do, inflation  September 22, 2021  is expected to drop back toward our longer-run goal.  The median inflation projection from Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL FOMC participants falls from 4.2 percent this year to 2.2 percent next year.   The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic.  As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could again prove to be greater and longer lasting than anticipated, posing upside risks to inflation.  Our framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal.  Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.  If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, we would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal. The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus, and risks to the economic outlook remain.  The Delta variant has led to significant increases in COVID-19 cases, resulting in significant hardship and loss and slowing the economic recovery.  Continued progress on vaccinations would help contain the virus and support a return to more normal economic conditions. The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  Our asset purchases have been a critical tool.  They helped preserve financial stability and market functioning early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster accommodative financial conditions to support the economy. At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee continued to discuss the progress made toward our goals since the Committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last  September 22, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL continues broadly as expected, the Committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted.   We also discussed the appropriate pace of tapering asset purchases once economic conditions satisfy the criterion laid out in the Committee’s guidance.  While no decisions were made, participants generally view that, so long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate.  Even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions. The timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to carry a direct signal regarding the timing of interest rate liftoff, for which we have articulated a different and substantially more stringent test.  We continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.  Half of FOMC participants forecast that these favorable economic conditions will be fulfilled by the end of next year; as a result, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate lies slightly above the effective lower bound in 2022.   Participants generally expect a gradual pace of policy firming that would leave the level of the federal funds rate below estimates of its longer-run level through 2024.  Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now.  More important than any forecast is the  September 22, 2021  fact that policy will remain accommodative until we have achieved our maximum-employment Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL and price-stability goals.  To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.  Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go first to Rachel Siegel.  

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Thank you, Michelle.  And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions.  When it comes to the taper and, eventually, to any rate increases, I’m wondering if you can walk us through what “substantial further progress” looks like, given the latest batch of projections that have PCE inflation coming in a little higher than the June projection, the unemployment rate also being higher than June, as well as the change to GDP lower than June.  If you could help us make sense of all those things as you sort through what “substantial further progress” looks like, that would be great.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So the test for beginning our taper is that we’ve achieved substantial further progress toward our goals of [2 percent] inflation and maximum employment.  And for inflation, we appear to have achieved more than significant progress—substantial further progress.  So that part of the test is achieved, in my view and in the view of many others.  So the question is really on the maximum-employment test.  So if you look at a good number of indicators, you will see that, since last December, when we articulated the test, and the readings today, in many cases more than half of the distance, for example, between the unemployment rate in December of 2020 and typical estimates of the natural rate—50 or 60 percent of that road has been traveled.  So that could be substantial further progress.    September 22, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL Many on the Committee feel that the “substantial further progress” test for employment has been met.  Others feel that it’s close, but they want to see a little more progress.  There’s a range of perspectives.  I guess my own view would be that the test—the “substantial further progress” test for employment is all but met.  And so, once we’ve met those two tests, once the Committee decides that they’ve met [them]—and that could come as soon as the next meeting; that’s the purpose of that language, is to put notice out that that could come as soon as the next meeting.  The Committee will consider that test, and we’ll also look at the broader environment at that time and make a decision whether to taper.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Howard Schneider.  

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Thanks, Michelle.  So, looking at the long-run rate.  I’m wondering if you could address that from two perspectives:  one, within the new framework that the Fed adopted last year and, second, from the perspective of the average household that’s now being asked to pay higher prices and increasingly higher prices for four years running when, for some this year, real wages have actually gone down.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So, as you can see, the inflation forecasts have moved up a bit in the outyears.  And that’s really, I think, a reflection of—and they’ve moved up significantly for this year.  And that’s, I think, a reflection of the fact that the bottlenecks and shortages that are being—that we’re seeing in the economy have really not begun to abate in a meaningful way yet.  So those seem to be going to be with us at least for a few more months and perhaps into next year.  So that suggests that inflation’s going to be higher this year, and a number—I guess the inflation rates for next year and 2023 were also marked up, but just by a couple of tenths.  Why—those are very modest overshoots.  You’re looking at 2.2 and 2.1, you know, two years  September 22, 2021  and three years out.  These are very, very—I don’t think that households are going to, you know, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL notice a couple of tenths of an overshoot.  That just happens to be people’s forecasts.   You know, we want to foster a strong labor market, and we want to foster inflation averaging 2 percent over time, and I think we’re very much on track to achieve those things.  In terms of the framework, I see this as very consistent with the framework.  We want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2 percent.  We want, we’re—that’s really the ultimate test of whether we’re getting this done under the framework.  And, you know, we do want inflation to run moderately above 2 percent.  I wouldn’t put too much on a couple of tenths over 2 percent in 2023 and ’24—one-tenth in ’24.  But you’re right, those are the numbers.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Colby Smith.  

[SECTION]

COLBY SMITH.  Chair Powell—thank you, Michelle.  Chair Powell, you mentioned ongoing discussions about the tapering timeline, and I’m wondering what the contours of that debate have been.  For those that want to move a bit more quickly, is it about maintaining optionality for a 2022 interest rate increase?  Or is it about financial stability risks?  Or concerns about the efficacy of asset purchases at a time when we have supply constraints?  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So let me say that there’s very broad support on the Committee for this plan, both as to the timing and as to the pace of the taper.  So this was a unanimous vote today, and I’d say quite broad support for this approach.  You’re correct that there are some who would prefer to have gone sooner, and they’ve made their arguments publicly.  For some of them, it’s a financial stability concern.  And for others, it’s other concerns.  They can make their own arguments.  This is an approach that the Committee will broadly support, and it will put us having completed our taper sometime around the middle of next year, which seems appropriate.    September 22, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL You know, the asset purchases, as I mentioned, were very, very important at the—in the early stages of the crisis.  They were essential in restoring market function in the Treasury and other markets.  Then, as the recovery got going, they supported aggregate demand, as they will do.  And now we’re in a situation where they still have a use, but it’s time for us to begin to taper them.  Their usefulness is much less as a tool than it was at the very beginning.   And, of course, this leaves the whole question of rate increases ahead, which is really where the framework—the framework is all about how we deal with rate increases and that sort of thing.  So we think this is the appropriate way to go.  And, again, broad support on the Committee.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Nick Timiraos.  

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Hi, Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, you have said the test for liftoff is more stringent than the test for tapering.  But if the near-term projections today are credible, more of your colleagues seem to think that rate liftoff, and not just a taper, may be closer at hand.  Does the Committee have a different opinion than you do about the threshold for liftoff that you’ve articulated?  Or do they believe that either inflation or economic growth will necessitate a rate increase sooner than you do?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so, again, substantial further progress toward our goals is the test for beginning the taper.  And the taper takes some months in everyone’s figuring.  So you’re going to be well away from satisfying the liftoff test when we begin the taper.  So in terms of the liftoff test, though, you know, it’s what we adopted last September.  It’s labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment.  And while we have interesting signs that, in many ways, the labor market’s very tight, we also have lots of slack in the labor market, and we think that those imbalances will sort themself out.  Inflation at 2 percent and on track to achieve it,  September 22, 2021  moderately higher inflation over 2 percent—you know, that really depends on the path of Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL inflation.  If inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met that test by the time we reach liftoff.   So I just think, if you look at what people are writing down for year-end 2022 numbers, some people are writing down very low unemployment rates.  And that’s only one indicator, but it suggests a very strong labor market.  And I think they’re writing down in good faith what they see as meeting the test.  There’s a range of perspectives about where the economy will be, but—by the way, all but one participants have us lifting off during 2023.  So it’s not really an unusually wide array of views about this.  

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  We’ll go to Jeanna Smialek.  

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hey, Chair Powell—thank you for taking our questions.  Prior to recent media reports, were you aware of the kind of security buying and selling that Presidents Kaplan and Rosengren were participating in last year?  And I wonder if you thought those were appropriate.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, no, I was not aware of the specifics of what they were doing.  So let me just say a couple things about this subject.  We understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission.  And that’s why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activity by Fed officials.  So those rules are, in many respects, the same as those for government agencies, plus a number of things that apply specifically to us because of our business.    September 22, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL One of those is—sort of, three things I would point to in terms of specific restrictures.  One is, ownership of certain assets is not allowed, and that’s bank securities and other things.  Secondly, there are times when we’re not allowed to trade at all or to, you know, buy and sell financial assets.  And that’s the period immediately before and during an FOMC meeting.  And, third, there’s regular disclosure.  So all of these—everyone’s, you know, ownership and activities are all disclosed on an annual basis.   So, you know, I would have had to go back and read people’s financial disclosures to know what their activities have been.  This has been our framework for a long time, and I guess you’d say it’s served us well.  The other thing you would say—that it is now clearly seen as not adequate to the task of really sustaining the public’s trust in us.  We need to make changes, and we’re going to do that as a consequence of this.  This will be a thoroughgoing and comprehensive review.  We’re going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Great.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Steve Liesman.  

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to follow up on Jeanna’s question, the issue of ownership of these stocks and trades.  Do you think it’s appropriate for Federal Reserve officials to be owning the same assets that the Federal Reserve is buying?  Is that one of the modifications that you’re looking at?  And in that these—you said yourself, they’re clearly not seen as appropriate.  In that the Fed’s code of conduct says Fed officials should avoid even the appearance of the, of conflict, do those trades, in fact—and holdings—violate the Fed’s code of conduct?  Finally, do you have a timeline as to when you might get—be done with your review?  Thank you, sir.   September 22, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Don’t have a timeline yet; we can start with that.  So, well, let me address the muni question, since that’s in there.  You know, I personally owned municipal securities for many, many years, and in 2019, I froze that.  Meaning I—they’re no—I’m holding all those securities, my wife and I, to maturity.  And munis were always thought to be a pretty safe place for a Fed person to invest because, as you know, the lore was that the Fed would never buy municipal securities.  So it was not an uncommon thing.   And so then comes the, you know, the COVID crisis, and I reversed that policy, and I did it without hesitating.  And the reason was that the financial markets, including the municipal financial market, were very much on the verge of collapse.  And it was time to go, and we did.  But we also checked with the Office of Government Ethics and—who looked carefully at it and said that I didn’t have a conflict.  So that’s one answer that I wanted to share with you.   Secondly, you’re right, though, as—we’re going to be looking at all those things.  I don’t want to get ahead of the process here and speculate about particular outcomes.  But this, again, comprehensive and deliberate process—we’re going to make changes.  I want to be able to look back on this years from now and know that we rose to meet this challenge and handled the situation well, and that what we did made a lot of sense and protected the public’s interest and the institution that we’re all a part of.  

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  I’m sorry, Chair Powell—I just want to follow up.  You said I was right.  When you said “right,” about that the Feds should not own—Federal Reserve officials should not own the same assets they’re buying?  Is that— 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I think that’s a reasonable thing.  Yeah, and, of course, for the most part, we don’t.  I mean, it was a real coincidence; I happened to pre-own these munis.  They were bought many years ago, actually.  And so we started buying munis as part of the Municipal  September 22, 2021  Liquidity Facility.  So it was really not a—it just was an unforeseen event.  And I couldn’t sell Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL them, so what I did was, I just held them, checked with the ethics people, and went ahead.  So, but as a general principle, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Chris Rugaber.  

[SECTION]

CHRIS RUGABER.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Wider question about jobs and the Fed’s schedule—the Fed’s policy framework that you laid out here.  You and other Fed officials have often talked about expecting a job market pickup in September as more children return to school, freeing up more parents to work, COVID abating.  You mentioned in the past the extra unemployment benefits expiring.  There’s some real-time data suggesting that we may not be seeing much of a return of labor supply.  So do you still expect to see that in the next couple of jobs reports?  And how would a relatively weak jobs report in September affect your plans?  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, you’re right, we have a—really, I’ll call it a unique situation where, by many measures, the labor market is tight.  And 11 million job openings, very widespread reports from employers all over the economy saying it’s quite difficult to hire people, wages moving up, and that kind—so, quite a tight labor market.  So our view, I think—widespread view a few months ago was that several things were coming together in the fall, including kids back to school, which would, you know, which would lighten caregiving duties, including the expiration of unemployment—extra unemployment benefits, and other things would come together to provide an increase in labor supply, and so we’d get out of this strange world where there’re lots of unemployed people and a high unemployment rate but a labor shortage.    September 22, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL And so what happened was, Delta happened.  And you had this very sharp spike in Delta cases.  And I think, so that affects—for example, when schools are open 60 percent of the time or when they’re always at a threat of being closed because of Delta, the Delta variant, you know, you might want to wait.  Rather than going ahead and taking a job and starting work only to have to quit it three weeks later, you’re going to wait until you’re confident of that.  So some of that these face-to-face service industries, travel and leisure, it just kind of stopped during those months.  So we—so that—really, the big shortfall in labor, in jobs, was largely in travel and leisure, and that’s because of—clearly because of Delta.  So that all happened.  And so what we—we know things that didn’t happen. I think there’s still—it may just be that it’s going to take more time.  But it still seems that, inexorably, people will—these are people who were largely working back in February of 2020.  They’ll get back to work when it’s time to do that.  It just may take a longer time.  You’re right, though—it didn’t happen with any force in September, and a lot of that was Delta.   In terms of the—you asked also about the test for November.  I think if the economy continues to progress broadly in line with expectations, then I think—and also the overall situation is appropriate for this, then I think we could easily move ahead at the next meeting.  Or not, depending on whether we feel like that, those tests are met.  

[SECTION]

CHRIS RUGABER.  Well, just a quick—if I could just quickly follow up, I mean, what, how much of that will depend on what kind of jobs report we get for September?  And, I mean, is it, you know, are you in a data-dependent phase here where you need to see certain numbers going ahead?  Or are we at a point where you’ve accumulated enough progress that—   September 22, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So it is, it’s accumulated progress.  So, you know, for me, it wouldn’t take a knockout, great, super strong employment report.  It would take a reasonably good employment report for me to feel like that test is met.  And others on the Committee—many on the Committee feel that the test is already met.  Others want to see more progress.  And, you know, we’ll work it out as we go.  But I would say that, in my own thinking, the test is all but met.  So I don’t personally need to see a very strong employment report, but I’d like to see a good—a decent employment report.  I mean, it’s not, it’s, again, it’s not to be confused with the test for liftoff, which is so much higher.  

[SECTION]

CHRIS RUGABER.  Great.  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Victoria Guida.  

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  So I wanted to ask about the Vice Chair of Supervision position and just—I was wondering if you could speak about how you view that role and the extent to which you defer to that person on regulatory policy.  And then, just sort of a related question:  As you know, Randy Quarles’s vice chairmanship ends next month, and I was wondering if he’s going to retain the supervisory portfolio until he’s replaced in that role.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So Dodd-Frank created this position, Vice Chair for Supervision, and it’s, there’s actually a specific assignment in the Dodd-Frank language, as I’m sure you know.  And, effectively, what it means is that the Vice Chair for Supervision is charged with setting the regulatory agenda.  And, you know, it’s a specific grant of authority.  And in the 10 years, almost, that I’ve been at the Fed, that person has really done that.  Dan Tarullo certainly did it, and Vice Chair Quarles did it as well.  And I would, I think—I respect that authority.  I respect that that’s the person who will set the regulatory agenda going forward, and I would accept that.    September 22, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL And, furthermore, you know, it’s fully appropriate to look at—for a new person to come in and look at the current state of regulation and supervision and suggest appropriate changes, and I welcome that.  In terms of Vice Chair Quarles’s term, we’re not currently in that situation, and I actually don’t have any updates for you on that today.  We’ll keep you posted on that.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Steve Matthews at Bloomberg.  

[SECTION]

STEVE MATTHEWS.  Thank you.  Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the inclusive monetary policy framework.  In particular, Bloomberg surveyed economists, and we found that they predict liftoff will happen when the U.S. unemployment rate is 3.8 percent but the Black unemployment rate is 6.1 percent.  And I’m wondering if a 6.1 percent unemployment rate for African Americans is consistent with full employment or whether it would need to be lower as part of your inclusive growth strategy.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right, so the point of the broad and inclusive goal was not to target a particular unemployment rate for any particular group.  Really, we look at a broad range of—a very broad range of metrics when we think about what maximum employment is.  And one of the things we look at is unemployment rates and participation rates and wages for different demographic and age groups and that kind of thing.  So we will do all of that.  So I think if you look back, what were we really thinking?  So we all saw the benefits of a strong labor market.  If you look at the last two or three years of, before the pandemic hit, you saw—after a lot of long progress, you saw a really strong labor market.  And you saw wages at the low end moving up faster than everywhere else—something that’s great to see.   We also saw the lowest unemployment rates for minorities of various, you know, for African Americans, for example, and also participation rates.  We saw a really, really healthy set of dynamics.  And, by the way, we also—there was no reason why it couldn’t continue.  There  September 22, 2021  were no imbalances in the economy, and then along came the pandemic.  We were not—there Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL was nothing in the economy that looked like a buildup of imbalances that could cause a recession.  So I was very much thinking that the country would really benefit from a few more years of this.  It would have been—so we’re all quite eager to get back to that.   We also said we wouldn’t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment, in the absence of inflation.  So that was another aspect of it, because we saw that that really benefited labor market participants in a broad and inclusive way.  That’s, of course, not the current situation.  We have significant slack in the economy and inflation well above target, not moderately above target.  So that’s, really, how we think about it.  It isn’t really just targeting the headline numbers, but it’s about taking all of those things into account in your thinking about what constitutes maximum employment.  

[SECTION]

STEVE MATTHEWS.  Just to follow up, should there be a significant gap between Black unemployment and overall unemployment for structural reasons that are outside of the control of the Fed that other people should be doing something about?  Or should that be—should the gap be narrowed, if not down to zero?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, you really—I mean, first of all, ideally, there wouldn’t be any gap, of course.  We would all love to see no such gap.  This is a persistent gap, and it’s very hard to explain based on typical metrics.  It’s just, it’s quite troubling, but it really is—you know, we have, you know, famously broad and blunt tools.  I think eliminating inequality and racial discrimination and racial disparities and that kind of thing is really something that fiscal policy and other policies—frankly, education policies and that kind of thing—are better at focusing on.  I think we’ve identified the part that we can do, and we’ll do that part.  But I’ve always been clear that it’s going to take policies broadly across society to work on these problems.   September 22, 2021

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Michael McKee.  

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  —a plan  for dealing with a debt default that included prioritization, that included changes in bank regulations and possibly selling defaulted—or, nondefaulted Treasuries and buying those who are—that are.  Are any or all of those still on the table?  Do you think any of those would work?  And what would happen to the economy, in your view, should the debt ceiling not be raised?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, I missed the first few words, but I think I got your question.  So it’s just very important that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely fashion so that the United States can pay its bills when and as they come due.  That’s a critically important thing.  The failure to do that is something that could result in severe reactions, severe damage to the economy and to the financial markets.  And it’s just not something that we could contemplate, that we should contemplate.  I’m not going to comment on particular tactics or things like that.  I’m just going to say that I think we can all agree that the United States shouldn’t default on any of its obligations—should pay them when and as due.  And that, you know, no one should assume that the Fed or anyone else can protect the markets or the economy in the event of a failure—fully protect in the event of a failure to, you know, to make sure that we do pay those debts when they’re due. members of Congress?

But, look, you can see that this is a major focus among those who have responsibility for it, and—including elected people.   September 22, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Hannah Lang.  

[SECTION]

HANNAH LANG.  Hi—thanks so much.  Senator Warren sent you a letter last week urging the Fed to break up Wells Fargo, citing what she called “ungovernable behavior” from the bank.  I’m just curious, under what circumstances would the Fed actually consider revoking a financial holding company’s license?  And if the indiscretions at Wells Fargo, in your opinion, warrant such an action?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we’re, of course, very closely monitoring Wells Fargo’s efforts to fix its widespread and pervasive problems.  They represent a serious matter to us, and the firm is required to remediate them.  And we will take appropriate supervisory action if the firm fails to meet our expectation.  We continue to hold the firm accountable for its deficiencies with an unprecedented asset cap that will stay in place until the firm has comprehensively fixed its problems.  And we’re not going to remove that asset cap until that’s done.  So bottom line is, we’ll take strong supervisory action if a firm is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices or violating laws.  But I can’t speak to our confidential supervisory assessments of any individual bank.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Now we’ll go to Michael Derby.  

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Thank you for taking my question.  You noted earlier in the press conference that you weren’t aware of the trading activity of the Boston and Dallas Fed Bank presidents.  As you know, those, all 12 regional Fed Bank presidents just went through the renomination process earlier this year.  And Governor Brainard described it as a rigorous process at the time.  So I want to know, did anybody know—did anybody at the Board level know about the stock trading activity?  And, going forward, do you still have confidence in the Dallas and Boston Fed Bank presidents to do their job?   September 22, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So these, I don’t need to tell you, we file, people file these reports annually.  And I think they were just quite recently filed for 2020.  So I don’t have any reason to think people at the Board would have known about particular trading that’s going on.  They will see that—there are people at the Fed who see the, you know, see the trading reports when they’re, you know, when they’re annually filed.   You know, in terms of having confidence and that sort of thing, I think no one is happy, no one on the FOMC is happy to be in this situation, to be having these questions raised.  It’s something we take very, very seriously.  This is an important moment for the Fed, and I’m determined that we will rise to the moment and handle it in ways that will stand up over time.  I’m very reluctant to get ahead of the process and speculate, though, about different things.  And, you know, when we have things to announce, we’ll go ahead and do that, but that’s really what I have for today.  

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  One small follow-up.  I mean, I know that you didn’t have the 2020 forms in hand, but you would have had past-year forms in hand.  And at least in the case of, like, the Dallas disclosure forms, similar trading activity was shown in years past.  So that, in theory, could have been something that came up in the renomination process.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So that’s, yeah, that’s a good question.  So, you know, the five-year review that we do under this unusual provision of law where all of the Reserve Bank presidents are reviewed for reappointment at the same time every five years, that is really a broad review about their leadership of the institution, their performance on the FOMC, all of those things.  And if there were a concern—a public concern or a private concern—about something that someone had done, we wouldn’t wait for the five-year.  We wouldn’t wait that day if there were concerns.    September 22, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL You’re right, though, these—as I mentioned, we have had a framework for a long time, and it’s similar to what other government agencies have, only it’s a little stricter.  And it is that you can trade financial instruments, but not specific ones like bank debt.  You can’t trade during the FOMC period and during the meeting—the blackout period and then during the meeting.  And then you disclose all this, and we have disclosed it for years.  So all of these things have been going—to the extent they’ve been going on, they’ve been a matter of public record.   And, you know—but, nonetheless—so that—you know, it was seeming to work just okay.  And now you look at it, and you see this, and you think, “We need to do better.”  And we will.  But you’re right, but it has not been part of the process.  And, appropriately, I don’t think it should have been.  I mean, I wouldn’t blame the people who conduct that review.  I really think, if someone had raised concerns or if we’d had concerns, then it would have been, but it wouldn’t have been part of that process.  It would have been raised instantly, rather than once every five years.  

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Jean Yung.  

[SECTION]

JEAN YUNG.  Thank you, Michelle.  Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about how the Fed would balance the two parts of its dual mandate if inflation stays elevated but we still have a labor shortage and participation remains lower than ideal.  Would you hold off on raising rates?  Or how would you think about that?  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, let me say one thing.  You’re looking for conditions consistent with maximum employment to lift off, and those conditions can change over time.  So you’re not necessarily bound by a particular level of the unemployment rate or the participation rate or anything else like that, which can change over time.  But more to your point, really, we actually  September 22, 2021  have a paragraph in our framework, and something like this has been there for a long time.  It’s, I Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL think it’s paragraph six.  And you’re talking about a situation in which the two goals are not complementary; they’re somehow in tension.  And if we judge that’s effect—that is the case, what it says is, we take into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with the mandate.   So, we used to call that the balanced-approach paragraph because it had those words.  So it’s a very difficult situation for any central bank to be—pardon me—to be in a situation where the two goals are in tension.  And that paragraph tries to address it by saying we would sort of weigh the equities between the two.  How long will it take, and how big are the gaps, and that kind of thing.  We don’t really think we’re in that—we’re sort of in that situation, I’d say, in a short-term way.  But we think, we do expect that this is sort of—because of the COVID shock and the reopening and all that, you’re seeing this temporarily. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Great.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Edward Lawrence.  

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Michelle.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question.  So on corporate debt, what happened with Evergrande that we’ve been watching, could that be—is that a preview of what could happen with the amount of corporate debt that’s out there?  In the past you’ve said you’re watching the level of corporate debt.  So is, what’s your level of concern right now?  And would you consider the Evergrande Group issue sort of a warning signal?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  About the United States, no.  Corporate defaults are very low in the United States right now.  Corporate leverage built up over the course of the long expansion that ended with the pandemic.  We were very concerned in the last year or so.  We were concerned in  September 22, 2021  the last year or so, and then I’d say very concerned at the beginning of the pandemic that, if Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL you’ve got a highly leveraged company and your revenue stops for an uncertain period, as things happened at the beginning of the crisis, we were very concerned that there would be a wave of defaults.  It didn’t happen, potentially—I mean, to a significant extent because of the CARES Act and the response that we undertook and all that.  It was a, you know, a much stronger response than we’ve ever had.  And I think for whatever reason now, you have very, very low default rates now among corporate debt.   You know, the Evergrande situation seems very particular to China, which has very high debt for an emerging market economy, really the highest that any emerging market economy has had.  And the government has been working to get that under control.  This is part of that effort.  The government put new strictures in place for highly leveraged companies.  And Evergrande is dealing with those strictures, and it’s something they’re managing.  In terms of the implications for us, there isn’t, there’s not a lot of direct United States exposure.  The big Chinese banks are not tremendously exposed.  But, you know, you would worry that it would affect global financial conditions through confidence channels and that kind of thing.  But I wouldn’t draw a parallel to the United States corporate sector.

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Sorry about that.  Let’s go to Greg Robb.  

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thanks.  Thanks for taking my question, Chair Powell.  I was wondering if, in your discussion about the tapering that—you said that officials think it’s appropriate to end around the middle of the year—if there was any discussion about what happens to the balance sheet then.  I’ve heard some Fed officials say that they wouldn’t shrink the balance sheet.  Was that discussed?  And what’s your stance on shrinking the balance sheet?  Thanks.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So my thinking on this has been:  Let’s get through the taper mentioned one, Greg, but, you know, and—which you need to start to think about, and we’ll do that.  But I want to get, we want to get through this taper decision, and then turn to those issues, rather than start, you know, thinking about them now and having the minutes discuss them and get people thinking that we are, you know, focused on those issues, because we’re really not.  And, you know, we do have the experience of what we did last time.  We’ve watched other countries and what they’ve done.  So I think we’ll be able to get to sensible decisions fairly expeditiously when it’s time.  But it’s just not time yet, in my thinking.  

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Scott Horsley.  

[SECTION]

SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You talked a little bit about inflation expectations.  And there does seem to be something of a divide between market expectations and the views of professional economists—which are pretty much in line with the FOMC  September 22, 2021  members—and laypeople’s expectations, at least as reflected in the recent New York Fed survey.  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL How much weight do you put on laypeople’s expectations?  And what do you think accounts for that divide?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So within—let’s just take the household surveys generally.  The New York Fed survey, let me talk about that specifically, and this is from the New York Fed.  It’s only an eight-year-old survey, and it does seem as though the, they’re looking three years out.  And it seems like there’s a high correlation between three-year and one-year.  For the most part, surveys are showing that households expect higher inflation in the near term but not in the longer term.  And that’s also what expectations are showing.   So there are many, many different inflation measures, of course.  And that’s why we have this thing called the CIE, which is the, it’s an index of—it’s market-based measures, it’s professional forecasters, and it’s household surveys.  And you just put them all—it’s not, you know, it doesn’t have a lot of grand theory about it.  You put them all in, and you measure the change.  So you should be—and, also, you measure things like the dispersion and that sort of thing, so you can look at all that.  And, you know, it tells a story of inflation expectations moving up.  Many of the different measures will also show inflation expectations moving back up to where they were in, say, 2013, which was before the really—the drop in inflation expectations broadly happened in ’14 and ’15—around then.  So that’s not a troubling thing.   But, you know, inflation expectations are terribly important.  We spend a lot of time watching them.  And if we did see them moving up in a troubling way and running persistently above levels that are really consistent with our mandate, then, you know, we would certainly react to that.  But we don’t really see that now.  We see more of a moderate increase that is—the  September 22, 2021  first part of which is welcome.  And because, you know, inflation expectations had drifted down, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL and it was good to see them get back up a bit.  But, again, we watch carefully.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Heather Scott.  

[SECTION]

HEATHER SCOTT.  Hi.  Sorry, you caught me off guard.  Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking my question.  I really appreciate it.  Again, on the taper timing.  You say it’s going to last to the middle of next year.  But with your concerns about the potential for upside risks to inflation, would you think you might need to have liftoff happen before you finish the tapering?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  That’s not my expectation.  Of course, we can always—we haven’t that we would have to.  We can certainly speed up or slow down the taper if we—if it becomes appropriate, though.  Absolutely.  In fact, back in ’13, when we tapered, we always said we weren’t on a preset course.  I think this will be a shorter period.  The economy’s much farther along than it was when we tapered in 2013.  So it makes sense to allow the runoff to happen.  It’s a very gradual taper.  It will be when we agree on it.  And, but we certainly have the freedom to either speed it up or slow it down if that becomes appropriate.  

[SECTION]

HEATHER SCOTT.  But you wouldn’t expect rate liftoff to happen until you’re finished with that process?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You wouldn’t, no, because, you know, when you’re—as long as you’re buying assets, you’re adding accommodation, and it wouldn’t make any sense to, you know, then lift off.  I mean, what you would do is, you’d speed up the taper, I think, if that were the situation you’re in.  Not—we don’t expect to be in that situation, but I do think it would be wiser at that point to go ahead and speed up the taper, just because the two are then working in the same direction.   September 22, 2021  Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 

[SECTION]

HEATHER SCOTT.  All right, thank you.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, for the last question, we’ll go to Jeff Cox.  

[SECTION]

JEFF COX.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question.  I just wanted to check in with you to see if you have an update at all on the efforts from the Fed to develop a central bank digital currency.  I believe that the report was supposed to come this summer, and indications that it’s going to come this month.  But the drumbeat seems to be kind of getting louder to see where the Fed’s heading on this, and just wondering if you can provide some update there.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure, I’d be glad to.  So we think it’s really important that the central bank maintain a stable currency and payment system for the public’s benefit.  That’s one of our jobs.  We also live in a time of transformational innovation around digital payments, and we need to make sure that the Fed is able to continue to deliver to the public a stable and trustworthy currency and payment system.  So there’s extensive private innovation, a lot of which is taking place outside the regulatory perimeter.  And innovation is fantastic.  Our economy runs on innovation.  But where the public’s money is concerned, we need to make sure that appropriate regulatory protections are in place, and today they really are not in some cases.   So with that in mind and with the creation of myriad private currencies and currency-like products, we’re working proactively to evaluate whether to issue a CBDC and, if so, in what form.  We have two broad workstreams, one of which is really technology, both at the Board and in the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s work with MIT—the other of which is to identify, scope out, deal with, analyze the various public policy issues.  As you mentioned, we do intend to publish a discussion paper soon that will be the basis for a period of public engagement—engagement with many different groups, including elected officials, around these issues.  We  September 22, 2021  think it’s our obligation to do the work, both on technology and public policy, to form a basis for Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL making an informed decision.   The ultimate test we’ll apply when assessing a central bank digital currency and other digital innovations is:  Are there clear and tangible benefits that outweigh any costs and risks?  We’re also, as you know, investing heavily right now in building a new settlement system for instant payments in the U.S.  It’ll be the first such major expansion of our core payment system since the 1970s.  We found the case for this quite compelling—for consumers, businesses, and just ensuring that all financial institutions have access to that payment system.  So, bottom line, we haven’t made a decision about the CBDC, but we will be issuing a discussion paper soon in order to form the basis of this public interaction that we’ll have.  Thank you very much.

JEFF COX.  If I could have a quick—could I get a quick follow on that?  Thank you.  I was just wondering if—okay—are you concerned at all with kind of falling behind in the global race for digital currencies?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I think it’s important that we get to a place where we can make an informed decision about this and do so expeditiously.  I don’t think we’re behind.  I think it’s more important to do this right than to do it fast.  We are the world’s reserve currency.  And I think we’re in a good place to make that analysis and make that decision—by the way, which will be a governmentwide decision.  We would do this, we would have to have a meeting of the minds with the Administration and also probably with Congress.  We would really like to have broad support for this.  It’s a very important innovation.  And I think we would need that to go ahead, and that’s the process we’re engaged in.  Thanks very much.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.   ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
47,2021-11-03,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability. Today, the FOMC kept interest rates near zero and, in light of the progress the economy has made toward our goals, decided to begin reducing the pace of asset purchases.  With these actions, monetary policy will continue to provide strong support to the economic recovery.  Given the unprecedented nature of the disruptions related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, we remain attentive to risks and will ensure that our policy is well positioned to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes.  I will say more about our monetary policy decisions after reviewing recent economic developments. Economic activity expanded at a 6.5 percent pace in the first half of the year, reflecting progress on vaccinations, the reopening of the economy, and strong policy support.  In the third quarter, real GDP growth slowed notably from this rapid pace.  The summer’s surge in COVID cases from the Delta variant has held back the recovery in the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic, including travel and leisure.  Activity has also been restrained by supply constraints and bottlenecks, notably in the motor vehicle industry.  As a result, both household spending and business investment flattened out last quarter.  Nonetheless, aggregate demand has been very strong this year, buoyed by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses.  With COVID case counts receding further and progress on vaccinations, economic growth should pick up this quarter, resulting in strong growth for the year as a whole.   November 3, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, and demand for workers remains very strong.  As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement slowed with the rise in COVID cases.  In August and September, job gains averaged 280,000 per month, down from an average of about 1 million jobs per month in June and July.  The slowdown has been concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality and education.   The unemployment rate was 4.8 percent in September.  This figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains subdued.  Some of the softness in participation likely reflects the aging of the population and retirements.  But participation for prime-aged individuals also remains well below pre-pandemic levels—in part reflecting factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus.  As a result, employers are having difficulties filling job openings.  These impediments to labor supply should diminish with further progress on containing the virus—supporting gains in employment and economic activity. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit.  Despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on African Americans and Hispanics. The supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors.  In particular, bottlenecks and supply chain disruptions are limiting how quickly production can respond to the rebound in demand in the near term.  As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent longer-run goal.  Supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated.  Nonetheless, it remains the case that the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly  November 3, 2021  connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic—specifically, the effects on supply and   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL demand from the shutdown, the uneven reopening, and the ongoing effects of the virus itself. We understand the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families, particularly those with limited means to absorb higher prices for essentials such as food and transportation.  Our tools cannot ease supply constraints.  Like most forecasters, we continue to believe that our dynamic economy will adjust to the supply and demand imbalances and that, as it does, inflation will decline to levels much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal.  Of course, it is very difficult to predict the persistence of supply constraints or their effects on inflation.  Global supply chains are complex; they will return to normal function, but the timing of that is highly uncertain.  We are committed to our longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation and to having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at this goal.  If we were to see signs that the path of inflation, or [of] longer-term inflation expectations, was moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we would use our tools to preserve price stability.  We will be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations. The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  Our asset purchases have been a critical tool.  They helped preserve financial stability early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions to support the economy. Last December, the Committee stated its intention to continue asset purchases at a pace of at least $120 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our  November 3, 2021  maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  At today’s meeting, the Committee judged that   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   the economy has met this test, and decided to begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning later this month, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities.  We also announced another reduction of this size in the monthly purchase pace starting in mid-New York prior to our December FOMC meeting.  If the economy evolves broadly as expected, we judge that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, implying that increases in our securities holdings would cease by the middle of next year.  That said, we are prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook.  And even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions. Our decision today to begin tapering our asset purchases does not imply any direct signal regarding our interest rate policy.  We continue to articulate a different and more stringent test for the economic conditions that would need to be met before raising the federal funds rate.   To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price-stability goal.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal.  

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Hi.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, the  November 3, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I would say it this way.  We try to focus on what we can control—and that is how to communicate as clearly as possible, in this highly uncertain world, how we’re thinking about the economic outlook and the balance of risks and how policy will evolve in that case and also in the cases, which are frequent, where the economy evolves in unexpected ways.  So the focus at this meeting is on tapering asset purchases, not on raising rates.   It is time to taper, we think, because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals, measured from last December.  We don’t think it’s time yet to raise interest rates.  There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment, both in terms of employment and in terms of participation.   Getting to your question, our baseline expectation is that supply bottlenecks and shortages will persist well into next year, and elevated inflation as well, and that, as the pandemic subsides, supply chain bottlenecks will abate—and job growth will move back up.  And as that happens, inflation will decline from today’s elevated levels.  Of course, the timing of that is highly uncertain.  But, certainly, we should see inflation moving down by the second or third quarter.  The time for lifting rates and beginning to remove accommodation will depend on the path of the economy.   We think we can be patient.  If a response is called for, we will not hesitate.  So, what I will tell you is, we will be watching carefully to see whether the economy evolves in line with our expectations, and policy will adapt appropriately. And that’s what I would say.  

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Based on—if I could follow up, based on your current outlook for the labor market, do you think it’s possible—or likely, even—that maximum employment could be achieved by the second half of next year?   November 3, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So if you look at the progress that we’ve made over the course of the last year, if that pace were to continue, then the answer would be:  “Yes, I do think that that is possible.”  Of course, we measure maximum employment based on a wide range of figures, but it’s certainly within the realm of possibility.  

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Next, we’ll go to Jeanna at the New York Times.  

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I was wondering if you could detail a little bit how you’re thinking about wages at this moment.  Obviously, we’re seeing strong wage growth, particularly for people in sort of lower-income fields.  I wonder if you see that as a positive thing or as a potential start to a wage–price spiral and sort of how you sort of delineate those two things.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So wages have been moving up strongly, very strongly.  And, in particular, I would point to the employment compensation index reading that we got last Friday.  Now, in real terms, they’ve been—they had been running a little bit below inflation, so real wages were not really increasing.  I think, with the ECI reading, it becomes close to maybe not increasing, but close to back to zero in terms of the real increase.  So wages moving up, of course, is how standard of living increases over the years for generation upon generation.  It’s very important, and it’s generally a good thing.  You know, the concern is a somewhat unusual case where, if wages were to be rising persistently and materially above inflation and productivity gains, that could put upward pressure on, or downward pressure on margins and cause companies to—or employers, really—to raise prices as a result, and you can see yourself, find yourself in what we used to call a wage–price spiral.  We don’t have evidence of that yet.  Productivity has been very high.  The ECI reading is just one reading.  Again, if you look back,  November 3, 2021  we—so we’ll be watching this carefully.  But I would say that, at this point, we don’t see   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL troubling increases in wages.  And we don’t expect those to emerge, but we’ll be watching carefully.  

[SECTION]

JOE PAVEL.  Next, we’ll go to Steve Liesman from CNBC.  

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wonder if you could perhaps give us your thinking about the tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment.  You talked about the shortfall of unemployment—reemployment relative to before the pandemic, and yet you have inflation, which is affecting everybody.  Are we at, or close to, a point where the risk of inflation is greater than the benefit that you’d—for recovering these lost jobs so that now, from a risk-management standpoint, it makes sense to move more aggressively on rate hikes?  And kind of a related question:  The statement today says you’ll keep policy accommodative until you hit that 2 percent inflation target.  Our surveys show looking for 5 percent inflation this year, 3½ percent next year—it sure seems like you’re on track to modestly or moderately exceed that 2 percent target.  Thanks.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So I’m not sure I totally got your first question, but I would say—in fact, could you just quickly, succinctly, say your first question again?  

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Sure.  The idea that the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, that you would keep policy accommodative to put this 5 million folks, or find these 5 million jobs again, at the same time all Americans will be suffering from higher inflation—is that tradeoff worth it, or is it better or smarter to raise rates right now to combat inflation and perhaps not lean so heavily on the employment side of the mandate?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, so, you know, this isn’t the traditional Phillips curve situation where there’s a direct tradeoff, where that’s really what we’re talking about.  The inflation that  November 3, 2021  we’re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market.  It’s due to bottlenecks, and it’s due to   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL shortages, and it’s due to very strong demand meeting those.  So I think it’s not the classical situation where you have that precise tradeoff.   But, you know, in this situation, we do have a provision in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals, as you know, that says when those two things are in tension, what we do is, we take into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with the mandate.  So we used to call that the “balanced approach” paragraph.  We have to think about the amount of the deviation, we have to think about the time it will take, and we have to make policy in a world where the two goals are in tension.  It’s very difficult.   But what it really boils down to is something that’s common sense.  And that is risk management.  We have to be aware of the risks that we’re—particularly now the risk of significantly higher inflation.  We see shortages and bottlenecks persisting into next year, well into next year.  We see higher inflation persisting, and we have to be in position to address that risk should it become really a threat to—should it create a threat of more persistent, longer-term inflation.  And that’s what we think our policy is doing now.  It’s putting us in a position to be able to address the range of plausible outcomes.  

[SECTION]

JOE PAVEL.  Thank you.  Next, we’ll go to Colby Smith at the Financial Times.  

[SECTION]

COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Chair Powell, what are the economic conditions that would perhaps warrant a faster pace of tapering?  And I’m wondering how you would also characterize the risks that the Fed may actually need to accelerate that process eventually.  Thank you.   November 3, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess, as I said in my opening remarks, assuming the economy performs broadly as expected, the Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, and we’re prepared to deviate from that path if warranted by changes in the economic outlook.   So I’m not going to give you a lot more detail on what that might be.  Of course, if we do see something like that happening, if it becomes a question, then we’ll communicate very transparently and openly about that.  But I’m just going to leave it with the words that are in the statement.  Sorry, was there a second part?   

[SECTION]

COLBY SMITH.  Yes.  It’s just on characterizing the risks that you might actually have to do so later on.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I would just leave you with the words we have here.  We are prepared to speed up or slow down the pace of reductions in asset purchases if it’s warranted by changes in the economic outlook.  And, again, if we feel like something like that’s happening, then we’ll be very transparent about it.  We wouldn’t want to surprise markets.  We’ll say, in light of this factor or these factors, we are considering doing this, and then we would either do it or not do it.  But so—but I’m not going to, you know, start making up examples of what that might be today.  Thanks.  

[SECTION]

COLBY SMITH.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

JOE PAVEL.  Thank you.  Next one, Rachel Siegel at the Washington Post.  

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you so much for taking our questions.  You mentioned at the beginning that the Fed understands the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families, especially those with limited means.  What is your message to those  November 3, 2021  families or consumers that are struggling with higher prices right now, and do you feel that your   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   expectations around transitory inflation, that message is reaching them?  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So, first of all, it is our job to—and we accept responsibility and accountability for inflation in the medium term.  We’re accountable to Congress and to the American people for maximum employment and price stability.  The level of inflation we have right now is not at all consistent with price stability.  By the way, we’re also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned.  So I would want to assure people that we will use our tools as appropriate to get inflation under control.   We don’t think it’s a good time to raise interest rates, though, because we want to see the labor market heal further.  And we have very good reason to think that that will happen as the Delta variant declines, so—which it’s doing now.  So “transitory” is a word that people have had different understandings of.  For some, it carries a sense of “short lived,” and that’s, you know, there’s a real time component—measured in months, let’s say.  Really, for us, what “transitory” has meant is that if something is transitory, it will not leave behind it permanently or very persistently higher inflation.  So that’s why we, you know, we took a step back from “transitory.”   We said “expected to be transitory,” first of all, to show uncertainty around that—we’ve always said that, by the way, in other contexts; we just hadn’t done it in the statement—but also to acknowledge, really, that it means different things to different people.  And then we added some language to really explain more what we’re talking about in paragraph two and paragraph three.  We said that “supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases,” and we said, “Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in  November 3, 2021  economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.”  So we’re trying to   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL explain what we mean and also acknowledging more uncertainty about “transitory.”   So it’s, I mean, it’s become a word that’s attracted a lot of attention that maybe is distracting from our message, which we want to be as clear as possible.  Ultimately, the only other thing I would say is, look, we understand completely that it’s particularly people who are living paycheck to paycheck or seeing higher grocery costs, higher gasoline costs—when the winter comes, higher heating costs for their homes.  We understand completely what they’re going through.  And, you know, we will use our tools over time to make sure that that doesn’t become a permanent feature of life.  Really, that’s one of our principal jobs, along with achieving maximum employment.  And that’s our commitment.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Chris Rugaber of the Associated Press.  

[SECTION]

CHRIS RUGABER.  Great.  Thank you, Michelle.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Well, I wonder if you could update us.  You talked about getting back to full employment, and so could you update how you define that?  I mean, you’ve, you know—a few months ago, yourself and other Fed officials talked about getting back to the pre-COVID labor market.  There were even hints you might try to do something better than that.  Now we heard talk of, as you mentioned, people retiring, and there’s talk of not being able to get back as—all the jobs back because of that and other trends.  You did mention the prime-age folks.  So can you give us some examples of things you're looking at, specifically, to measure full employment?  Will you be looking at prime-age employment population ratio, for example, and, if so, do you need to see it get back to pre-COVID levels to achieve maximum employment, or is there something short of that that would work?  Thank you.   November 3, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks.  So maximum employment is, it’s a broad—what would we say?—broad-based and inclusive goal that’s not directly measurable and changes over time due to various factors.  You can’t specify a specific goal.  So it’s taking into account quite a broad range of things, and, of course, employment—levels of employment—[and] participation are a part of that.  But, in addition, there are other measures of what’s going on in the labor market, like wages is a key measure of how tight the labor market is—the level of quits, the amount of job openings, the flows in and out of various states.  So we look at so many different things, and you make an overall judgment.   Now, the temptation at the beginning of the recovery was to look at the data in February of 2020 and say, well, that’s the goal because we didn’t know any—that’s what we knew.  We knew that was achievable in a context of low inflation.  I think we’re in a, you know, we’re learning that.  We have to be humble about what we know about this economy, which is still very, you know, COVID-affected, by the way.  A lot of what we’re seeing in the last 90 days is because of Delta.  We were on a path to a very different place.  Delta put us on a different path.  And we see these things.  But, so I think we’re going to have to—ideally, we would have, we would see further development of the labor market in a context where there isn’t another COVID spike, and then we would be able to see, I think, a lot.  We would see whether—how does participation react in that world, in that sort of post-COVID world?   Right now, people are staying out of the labor market because of caretaking [and] because of fear of COVID to a significant extent.  You know, we thought that schools reopening and elapsing unemployment benefits would produce some sort of additional labor supply.  That doesn’t seem to have been the case, interestingly.  So I think there’s room for a whole lot of humility here, as we try to think about what maximum employment would be.  We’re going to  November 3, 2021  have to see some time post-COVID so that we know—or post-Delta, anyway—to see what is   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL possible.  And I think the learning for those of us who lived through the last cycle is that, over time, you can get to places that didn’t look possible.   Now, what we also have now, though, is, we have high inflation.  So we have a completely different situation now where we have high inflation, and we have to balance that with what’s going on in the employment market.  So it’s a complicated situation, and I would say, we will, we hope to achieve significantly greater clarity about where this economy is going and what the characteristics of the post-pandemic economy are over the first half of next year.  

[SECTION]

JOE PAVEL.  Thanks.  We’ll go to Howard Schneider at Reuters.  

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks, and thanks for doing this.  So, given that answer about employment, I would like to get back to Steve’s question a little bit.  On a headline basis, just as it’s evolved this year, do you feel that the two tests on inflation have been met?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sorry, the two tests?  

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  The two tests in the statement—the guidance that it has to hit 2 percent and be on track to moderately be above 2 percent.  Has the economy cleared that?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  That’s a decision for the Committee.  I would put it to you this way.  When we reach maximum employment, when we reach a state where labor market conditions are at maximum employment in the Committee’s judgment, it’s very possible that the inflation test will already be met.  We’re aware that that language sounds, it sounds a little out of touch with what’s going on, but, you know, we’re not at maximum employment.  When that is the case, we’ll look to see whether the inflation test is met, and there’s a good chance that it will be if you look at how inflation has evolved in the last year and a half.   November 3, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  So, to follow up, so you’re not willing to commit that the current levels of inflation and their persistence have met “moderately” and “for some time.”  So, given that, I mean, how should we wonder what “moderately” over and “for some time” mean? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  What I’m really saying is, that question is not before us right now.  You know, we had the question on when to taper.  We’ve now answered that question and the speed of it and all that.  We have not focused on whether we meet the liftoff test, because we don’t meet the liftoff test now because we’re not at maximum employment.   What I’m saying is, given where inflation is and where it’s projected to be, let’s say we do meet the maximum-employment test.  Then the Committee—the question for the Committee at that time will be, has the inflation test been met?  And, you know, I don’t want to get ahead of the Committee on that, but the answer may very well be “Yes, it’s been met.”  But we’re not asking that question today, because we’re not running a liftoff test.  We’re not evaluating the liftoff test today.  We didn’t have that discussion at today’s meeting.  We did talk about the economy and the development of the economy, but we didn’t ask ourselves whether the liftoff test is met, because, you know, it’s clearly not met on the maximum-employment side.  

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg.  

[SECTION]

MATTHEW BOESLER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg.  So, when you’re looking at this question of assessing whether or not the U.S. economy is at maximum employment, do you have a framework for making that judgment that is independent of what inflation is doing?  And, if not, does it kind of complicate that assessment, given all of the uncertainty about inflation right now and the inclination to believe that, you know, the high inflation we’re seeing is not related to capacity utilization in the labor market?  Thank you.   November 3, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we don’t actually define maximum employment as—we define it in terms of inflation, but, of course, there is a connection there.  Maximum employment has to be a level that is consistent with stable prices.  But that’s not really how we think about it.  We think about maximum employment as looking at a broad range of things.  You can’t just look at—unlike inflation, where you can have a number.  But with maximum employment, you could be in a situation, hypothetically, where the unemployment rate is low, but there are many people who are out of the labor force and will come back in.  And so you wouldn’t really be at maximum employment, because there’s this group that isn’t counted as unemployed.  So we look at a range of things.  So the thing is, by many measures, we are at a very tight labor market.  I mentioned quits and job openings and wages and things.  Many of them are signaling a tight labor market, but the issue is, how persistent is that?  Because you have people who are held out of the labor market, you know, of their own—they’re holding themselves out of the labor market because of caretaking needs or because of fear of COVID, or, for whatever reason, they’re staying out.  And it’s clear that there are, you know—with tremendous demand for workers and wages moving up, it does seem like we’re set up to go back to a higher job-creation rate.  So that would suggest that you’re not at maximum employment.  So, at the end of the day, it is a judgment thing.  But, of course, at the end of it, it also has to be a level of employment that’s consistent with price stability.  

[SECTION]

MATTHEW BOESLER.  And if I could just follow up briefly, you know, you’ve talked a little bit about this possibility that the two goals might be in tension and how you would have to balance those two things.  Could you talk a little bit about what the Fed’s process for balancing those two goals would be in the event that, say, come next year, you decide there’s a serious risk of persistent inflationary pressures despite ongoing employment shortfalls?   November 3, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  I mean, again, it’s a risk-management thing.  It’s not—I can’t reduce it to an equation, but, ultimately, it’s about risk management.  So you want to be in a position to act, to cover the full range of plausible outcomes, not just the base case.  And in this case, the risk is skewed.  For now, it appears to be skewed toward higher inflation.  So we need to be in a position to act in case it becomes necessary to do so or appropriate to do so, and we think we will be.  So that’s how we’re thinking about it.  And I think, though, that, judgmentally, too, it’s appropriate to be patient.  It’s appropriate for us to see what the labor market and what the economy look like when they heal further.   We know that we were on a path to a different place, as I mentioned, when Delta arrived.  And Delta stopped, it stopped job creation.  It stopped that transition away from a goods-focused economy where there’s excess demand for goods because there—services are not available.  People are not traveling.  That transition itself could help bring inflation down, because, presumably, people would spend a little less on goods while they start spending more on travel and all sorts of travel services and things like that.  So we want to see that healthy process unfold as we decide what the true state of the economy is, and we think it will evolve in a way that will mean lower inflation.  Bottlenecks should be abating.  We start to see that now with some of them, but, overall, they haven’t gotten better overall, and, you know, we’re very aware of that.  So that’s really how we’re thinking about it.  We’re thinking that time will tell us more.  In the meantime, we don’t think it’s time to raise rates now.  You know, if we do conclude that it’s necessary to do so, then we’ll be patient, but we won’t hesitate.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Edward Lawrence at Fox Business.   November 3, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the call.  So the Federal Reserve—I want to talk about climate change.  The Federal Reserve released a statement today—says “the Federal Reserve supports the efforts . . . to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory” outcomes.  Is this putting us on the path to regulate what banks can offer loans on or invest in, like coal plants or fossil fuels?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So that’s not a decision for bank regulators or for any agency.  That’s a decision for elected representatives.  So we feel that any role that we have—and we do think we have a role in climate change.  It relates to our existing mandates, and our existing mandates are, really, prudential regulation of financial institutions.  We expect them, and the public will expect us to expect them, to understand and be in a position to manage their risks.  So that’s physical risk, and it’s transition risk for climate.  And, by the way, the large financial institutions are doing this already, and, you know, we think that’s right within our mandate.  There’s also a financial stability question, the overall stability of the financial system.  And so, from that standpoint, we can do research.  We can try to help understand what will the pathways be through which climate change effects the economy—both physical risk and transition risk.  That’s what we can do, and that’s what we will do.  And we’ll do it well.  Within the frame of our existing mandates, we’ll do it well.  We’re not the people who will decide the national strategy on climate change.  That has to be elected people, and not so much us.  We feel like we have that narrow mandate, and we will do it well.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Great, thank you.  Victoria Guida at Politico.   November 3, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  So the Fed recently announced that there is going to be new conflict-of-interest rules for investments by Fed officials, and this follows, obviously, the resignation of two regional Fed presidents.  And I’m just wondering, do you think that there is more that you will need to do to rebuild the credibility of the Fed, such as, you know, requiring officials to put their assets in blind trusts?  And also, if you could speak to whether you have any concerns that any rules or laws were broken by Fed officials.  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we, you know, we—let me just say that this system, the ethics system we had in place had been in place for decades and had, as far as we know, served us well, and then that was no longer the case.  And so we had no moment of denial about that.  As a group, we stepped in, and we took the actions that we took.  And, you know, within one FOMC cycle, we announced a new set of rules to, you know, to try to put us back where we need to be, which is, we need to have the complete trust of the American people that we’re working in their interest all the time—absolutely critical to our work, as it is for any government agency.  And I feel like this called that into question.  So we reacted, I would characterize it, strongly and forcefully.  If there were other things that we could do that were reasonable, we would certainly do them. So you asked me about blind trusts.  You know, the overall authority for ethics around these issues in the federal government is the Office of Government Ethics, OGE.  And they have a long-held position which is not favorable to blind trusts.  They do not encourage them.  They don’t think they’re effective.  They think they’re cumbersome.  And they think there are better ways to get at the things that need to be done.  And those are the things that we’re actually doing.  So I don’t know that there are any blind trusts, for that reason, because they are the, they’re the regulator.  They say this on their website, if you look.  In terms of laws broken, you know, I  November 3, 2021  asked the inspector general to look to see whether there were rules broken and whether there   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL were laws broken, and I won’t speculate on that.  But that is with the inspector general now and, of course, out of my hands.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Mike McKee at Bloomberg.  

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, the critics of your patience policy argue that, given the long and variable lags with which monetary policy works, that you are likely to end up, given inflation, by having to raise rates faster and farther than you would have liked and, therefore, send the economy into recession.  Given the fact that, basically, your forecast has been chasing inflation over the last year, and now you’re talking about it not coming down until the second or third quarter, why would they be wrong in thinking that?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so, let me say what’s happened—and we’re very, very straightforward about it—is that inflation has come in higher than expected, and bottlenecks have been more persistent and more prevalent.  We see that just like everybody else does, and we see that they’re now on track to persist well into next year.  That was not expected—not expected by us, not expected by other macro forecasters.   Now, let me say, you know, it’s difficult enough to just forecast the economy in normal times.  When you’re talking about, you know, global supply chains in turmoil, it’s a whole different thing.  And you’re talking about a pandemic that’s holding people out of the labor force for reasons that we can sample, but we don’t have a lot of experience with this.  So it’s very, very difficult to forecast and not easy to set policy.  So we have to set policy, though.  So that’s what we’re doing.   And, you know, so, to look at your question this way, I don’t think that we’re behind the curve.  I actually believe that policy is well positioned to address the range of plausible  November 3, 2021  outcomes, and that’s what we need to do.  I do think it would be premature to raise rates today.    Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   That’s not—I don’t think that’s controversial.  Certainly, I don’t know anyone arguing for that today.  And the reason is that there’s still ground to cover to get to maximum employment.  And we don’t want to stop that when there’s good reason to think—there’s still good reason to think, although it’s been delayed, clearly, there’s good reason to think that the economy will reopen, particularly if we do get past, you know, significant outbreaks of COVID.  That’s when we’re really going to see what the characteristics of the labor market are.   And, you know, I think, you know, the bottlenecks that we’re seeing in global supply chains around goods and, frankly, now at our own domestic ports, because demand is stronger than the capacity of those ports—those things are going to work themselves out.  We have a flexible economy.  It’ll take some time, but, you know, it took—you know, the experts managed to create a vaccine faster than, certainly, than I expected.  And I think this stuff will work itself out over the course of next year.  That is my baseline understanding, and that’s a very widely held one among people.  But, you know, we are prepared for different eventualities, and we will use our tools to achieve price stability and maximum employment.  And we’re going to let the data lead us to where we need to go.  Our policy will adapt—and has already adapted—to the changing understanding of inflation and of bottlenecks and the whole supply-side story—which is also partly a demand story.  So our policy will continue to adapt as is appropriate.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer at Marketplace.  

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  So you announced that the Fed is going to taper at a rate of, starting at $15 billion a month, and that’s more than twice the pace of the last taper.  So why are you tapering faster this time?   November 3, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  The economy is in quite a different place than when we tapered back in, I guess it was, 2013.  We were much farther away from maximum employment.  Inflation was much lower.  This is an economy where demand is very, very strong, very strong, and job openings substantially exceed the number of unemployed people.  So the need for further stimulus is far less than it was in 2013, where we still had quite a ways to go.  I mean, after we began that taper, it was still many years before we reached what I would characterize as conditions consistent with maximum employment, let alone price stability.   So this is quite a different situation, and, you know, the Committee unanimously felt today that we had met the test that we’d articulated, and this was appropriate.  And this is faster than, you know, than what people had expected six months ago.  It’s earlier and faster, and that’s because our, as I mentioned, our policy has been adapting to the situation as it evolves, as it’s clarifying itself, and that’s partly because we see inflation coming in higher—so.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Mike Derby.  

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Yes, thank you for taking my question.  I wonder if the Fed has given any thoughts yet to the endgame for the balance sheet in terms of, you know, once you get the taper process complete, will you hold the balance sheet steady, or will you allow it to start passively winding down?  And then, in a related question, do you have any greater insight into what Fed bond buying actually does for the economy?  In terms of its economic impact, have you been able to, you know, measure it or quantify it in any fashion, you know, because I’m sure you know there’s often been questions about, what is bond buying actually doing to help the 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So in terms of the balance sheet, those questions that you mention—we haven’t gone back to them.  Now that we’ve tapered, I expect that that’s exactly economy?  November 3, 2021  what we’ll do in coming meetings.  And we’ll do it in an orderly fashion, and we’ll talk about   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL reinvestment and all those things.  And we don’t have to make decisions on those yet.  But, you know, typically, when we’re doing a new subject like that, we’ll have a series of briefings and discussions.  And that’s what we will now begin to do.   In terms of the effect of asset purchases on the economy, so, there’s a tremendous amount of research and scholarship on this.  And, you know, you can kind of—you can find different people coming out with different views.  But I would say, the most mainstream view would be that you’re at the effective lower bound, so how do you affect longer-term rates?  There are two ways.  One, so you can’t lower rates—let’s say you can’t lower rates any further, hypothetically.  So you can give forward guidance.  You can say, we’re going to keep the rates low for a period of time, either [for] a specific period, [or] until certain conditions are met.  The markets will do the math, and that’ll have an effect on longer-term borrowings even, you know, 10, 30 years out kind of thing.  So that’s one thing.  The other thing you can do is, you just go buy those securities, buy longer-term securities.  That will drive down longer-term rates and hold them lower, and, you know, rates right across the, right across the rate spectrum matter for borrowers.  So lower rates encourage more borrowing, encourage more economic activity.  People—you can service your debt.  You have more free cash flow.  You know, it’s not different from what we do at the short end.  So that was discussed long before anybody did it.  That was—I think Milton Friedman said that that was what you could do if you were pinned at the lower bound, many, many years ago.  So, anyway, that’s how it’s supposed to work.  And, you know, it’s quite hard to be precise about these things because, you know, you only have one economy, and you can’t run two different economies right next to each other and do a scientific experiment.  But most people  November 3, 2021  find—most of the findings are that it does support economic activity in the way that you would   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL expect, which is to say, at the margin, more economic activity with lower rates, which is why we do what we do.  More accommodative financial conditions lead to more economic activity, over time, with a lag.  So I think that’s the main finding I would say on QE.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’re going to go to Paul Lamonica at CNN.  

[SECTION]

PAUL LAMONICA.  Chair Powell, Chair Powell, you’ve addressed already questions about the stock purchases that took place from some of the regional Fed presidents and, you know, addressing the American people to make sure that they can trust the Fed.  I was wondering, also, in light of the fact that, you know, we now have questions about your own future, whether or not President Biden will nominate you for a second term, what would you say—to the President and to senators that, potentially, you know, will be voting on a renomination—about this, specifically with regards to your future as Fed Chair for a possible second term?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So I’m not going to—I won’t have any—I will answer your question, Paul, but I’m not going to have any comment whatsoever on the renomination process at all.  

[SECTION]

PAUL LAMONICA. Fair enough.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I will say, though, that I have briefed Administration officials, and I’ve briefed people on Capitol Hill in detail about what we did and why we did it, and seeking their feedback, getting their reaction.  But, you know, this is—part of my job is—Congress has oversight over the Fed, and we take that very seriously.  So if you’re on our, one of the two committees that has oversight over us, then I’m in regular contact with you, probably.  And, you know, when something like this comes up, I’m on the phone.  I’m offering to meet with you and explain it to you and answer your questions and identify any concerns people might have.  That’s  November 3, 2021  just part of my job.  So I do that.  I don’t talk about particular conversations.  But you can   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL assume I’ll always do that.  And I certainly did it in this case.  

[SECTION]

PAUL LAMONICA.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker.  

[SECTION]

HANNAH LANG.  Hi.  I wanted to ask about the supplementary leverage ratio.  Is the Fed still planning on taking comment on ways to permanently address that, and how concerned are you, ultimately, about banks’ willingness to intermediate in the Treasury markets without a permanent fix?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I don’t have anything for you on supplemental leverage ratio right now.  We are looking at ways to, if there are ways we can address liquidity issues through that channel.  We’re also—we also have a—there’s a working group headed by [the] Treasury about, over Treasury [securities] markets, and what happened in the acute phase of the pandemic, and what structural things may need to be done.  So that would be part of that workstream, and I know that there’s a lot going on.  I’m not sure when that report will be out.  So it’s work under way. That’s one of the many issues that are part of that, along with things like central clearing of Treasuries, greater central clearing, and, you know, many other ideas.  It’s important that we have a liquid Treasury [securities] market.  It’s a huge public benefit that we do, and, you know, I think we need to do those things that enable that, you know, while also assuring the safety and soundness of our largest financial institutions, who tend to be the main dealers.  So we have to make sure that that’s always a first order of concern as well.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo Finance.   November 3, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance.  So, just to expand on the ethics conversation, you talked about how you engage with people on Capitol Hill and in the Administration.  You talked about what you’ve done already, but I’m just wondering if you can take a step back and just assess whether or not there was reputational damage as a result of that, either from the public’s view or from the financial community’s view of the Federal Reserve’s independence.  And then, secondly, do you look back on the whole episode and have thoughts on your individual responsibility in preventing something like this from having happened?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL  You know, I think it’s too soon to say what the reputational damage is.  I think, from the very beginning, my reaction was:  We need to deal with this straightforwardly, transparently, and forcefully.  And that’s what we’re going to do.  I mean, it’s, it means everything to me that we do whatever it takes to make sure that nothing like this happens again, and I like to think we’ve made a real good start on that.  If you think about it, you cannot execute a trade unless it’s precleared, and then you have to say, “Execute.”  It’s not even a trade.  Really, there’s no trading going on.  This is for investment and, you know, getting liquidity for life’s expenses.  But you then have to wait 45 days to actually execute that sale or purchase.  So I think it’s a pretty good system.  We’ll always be looking to make it better.   So in terms of our independence, you know, look, I think we will address this, and I think we have.  And I like to think it’s enough, but it’s going to, you know—we’re just beginning to implement it.  We have to write the rules, which we’re doing, you know, as quickly as possible.  We need more people.  We’re going to have to resource this much more significantly here at the Board, and also, we’re going to need appropriate technology, because, you know, the Fed has more than—the System has more than 30,000 employees.  Not all of them, far few of them, will  November 3, 2021  be covered by this, but the senior officers, who will be covered by this, will, you know, will have   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   to have technology access, and it’s going to have to work efficiently.  So there’s a lot of work to do to implement.   You know, again, I would just say, this system has been in place for decades.  And it was in place when I took over.  It was in place for the last, at least the last three or four Chairs.  And, you know, it was what it was.  And, you know, it proved to have weaknesses in it.  And part of that was, it wasn’t uniformly enforced across the System.  I’m a big believer in the value of the Federal Reserve System and the Reserve Banks.  But you had 12 different ethics officers at 12 different Banks.  And you had ethics people here.  And, you know, compliance wasn’t, it wasn’t all exactly the same.  It was a little bit different and uneven, and also, the rules were—you know, we didn’t imagine the problems that happened.  And they may have actually been—I don’t know this—but they may actually have been in compliance with the specifics of our rules.  They were clearly not in compliance with the part of our rules that said, don’t do anything that would create that appearance.  I mean, that’s clear.  This was a bad appearance.  So, anyway, what can we do?  We are where we are.  It happened, and we just have to deal with it forthrightly and transparently and “own” it and step up to this, you know, meet this moment.  I’m totally committed to doing that.  And, again, if there are better ideas, I’d love to hear them, but I think we have so far made a good start.  

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  When you say you spoke with Administration officials, did that include the President?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I’m not going to answer who I spoke to at all.  I just, I’m not going to give you any names, so don’t take that as a “yes” or “no.”  I’m just not going to start down that road.     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Thank you.  We’re going to go to Jeff Cox for the last  question.  

[SECTION]

JEFF COX.  Yes, thank you.  Chair, I just want to dig a little bit deeper on employment.  We’ve seen what’s been called the great resignation, folks leaving their jobs in record numbers.  Is there any feeling there that maybe you’ve been accused of “fighting the last war”—that perhaps the labor dynamics have changed in the post-COVID environment and that full employment may not look like what it looked like before?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So, what’s happening is, people are leaving their jobs.  They’re quitting their jobs in all-time-high numbers—but, in many cases, going back into employment and getting higher wages.  So a lot of the higher wages you’re seeing are for job switchers rather than incumbents.  So that’s just, that’s a sign of a really strong labor market, as opposed to people just running off and quitting.  There have also been—there are a significant number of retirements, and we’ll just have to see what that means.   So, toward the end of the last cycle, which was the longest in our recorded economic history, we did see labor force participation moving up well above what economists estimate was the trend, and part of that was people staying in the labor force or just not retiring at the rates they were expected to retire.  So maybe this was just catch-up on that.  I am a believer that, over time, you won’t know how far—you won’t know what can happen with labor force participation in advance.  You’re just going to have to give it some time, because we saw that over and over There are things that we can, where we can say, you know, this is where the limit is.  Labor force participation is a much more flexible subject for me, and so I do think we need to be again.  November 3, 2021  humble about what the limits are of labor force participation.  But we expect labor force   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL participation to pick up.  We don’t know the pace at which it will do so.  So in terms of full employment, as I discussed earlier, I think, at the very beginning of the recovery, the natural thing to do was to look back at labor conditions, labor market conditions in about that labor market, a really historically good labor market—never perfect, but a good labor We’re in a different world now. This is a—it’s just very different.  The pandemic recession was the deepest, and the recovery has been the fastest.  And wages didn’t really go down.  And, you know, real incomes were more than fully replaced by fiscal policy [support].  All of this is completely unusual.  You know, an economy where inflation was driven by services is now inflation where—all the inflation is in goods, which have had negative inflation for a quarter-century.   So you ask about full employment.  I think we have to—I’m very open to the thought that it’s going to be an empirical question of where it is located, and we’re just going to learn more and more.  I mean, one thing we’ll learn, I think, I hope we’ll learn in the next, in the near term is, once the Delta variant really does continue to decline, what’s going to happen to employment?  Are we going to start to see over the winter, you know, significant increases in jobs again?  If you look back, the three-, six-, and nine-month average job creation is between 550,000 and 600,000.  So if you think of that as a stronger—you don’t have to think back to the million-job months of June and July.  You can just think, okay, 550 to 600—if we should get back on that path, then we would be making good progress, and we like to see that, of course.  So  November 3, 2021  we’ll know so much more.  And, believe me, we understand.  It’s a different world in so many   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL ways.  And we’re very open to that.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you all for joining us today.   ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
48,2021-12-15,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability. Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and updated its assessment of the progress that the economy has made toward the criteria specified in the Committee’s forward guidance for interest rates.  In addition, in light of the strengthening labor market and elevated inflation pressures, we decided to speed up the reductions in our asset purchases.  As I will explain, economic developments and changes in the outlook warrant this evolution of monetary policy, which will continue to provide appropriate support for the economy.   Economic activity is on track to expand at a robust pace this year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy.  Aggregate demand remains very strong, buoyed by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses.  The rise in COVID cases in recent weeks, along with the emergence of the Omicron variant, pose[s] risks to the outlook.  Notwithstanding the effects of the virus and supply constraints, FOMC participants continue to foresee rapid growth.  As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 5.5 percent this year and 4 percent next year. Amid improving labor market conditions and very strong demand for workers, the economy has been making rapid progress toward maximum employment.  Job gains have been solid in recent months, averaging 378,000 per month over the last three months.  The unemployment rate has declined substantially—falling 6/10 of a percentage point since our last  December 15, 2021  meeting and reaching 4.2 percent in November.  The recent improvements in labor market   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL conditions have narrowed the differences in employment across groups, especially for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics.  Labor force participation showed a welcome rise in November—but remains subdued, in part reflecting the aging of the population and retirements.  In addition, some who otherwise would be seeking work report that they are out of the labor force because of factors related to the pandemic, including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus.  At the same time, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years.  How long the labor shortages will persist is unclear, particularly if additional waves of the virus occur.  Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent by the end of the year.  Compared with the projections made in September, participants have revised their unemployment rate projections noticeably lower for this year and next. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and [to] the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation.  In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term.  These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus.  As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent longer-run goal and will likely continue to do so well into next year.  While the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic, price increases have now spread to a broader range of goods and services.  Wages have also risen briskly, but, thus far, wage growth has not been a major contributor to the elevated levels of inflation.  We are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity [growth] could put  December 15, 2021  upward pressure on inflation.  Like most forecasters, we continue to expect inflation to decline to   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   levels closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal by the end of next year.  The median inflation projection of FOMC participants falls from 5.3 percent this year to 2.6 percent next year; this trajectory is notably higher than projected in September. We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are committed to our price-stability goal.  We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.  We will be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations. The Fed’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  In support of these goals, the Committee reaffirmed the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate.  We also updated our assessment of the progress the economy has made toward the criteria specified in our forward guidance for the federal funds rate.  With inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some time, the Committee expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment.   All FOMC participants forecast that this remaining test will be met next year.  The median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 0.9 percent at the end of 2022, about ½ percentage point higher than projected in September.  Participants expect a gradual pace of policy firming, with the level of the federal funds rate generally near estimates of its longer-run level by the end of 2024.  Of course, these projections do not represent a  December 15, 2021  Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL year or more from now. At today’s meeting, the Committee also decided to double the pace of reductions in its asset purchases.  Beginning in mid-January, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities.  If the economy evolves broadly as expected, similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, implying that increases in our securities holdings would cease by mid-March—a few months sooner than we anticipated in early pressures and a rapidly strengthening labor market, the economy no longer needs increasing amounts of policy support.  In addition, a quicker conclusion of our asset purchases will better position policy to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes.  We remain prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook.  And, even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities will continue to foster accommodative financial conditions.  To conclude:  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price-stability goal.   Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Mr. Chair, we’ll go to Rachel from the Washington Post. 

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Thank you very much, Michelle.  And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions.  The latest FOMC materials say that the FOMC thinks it will be appropriate  December 15, 2021  to keep rates near zero until labor market conditions reach levels consistent with maximum   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL employment.  And there are also three rate hikes penciled in the projections for next year.  In order to set up those hikes, what will maximum employment have to look like?  When will you know that that threshold has been met?  And how will that be communicated?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So maximum employment, if you look at our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, maximum employment is something that we look at a broad range of indicators.  And those would include, of course, things like the unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate, job openings, wages, flows in and out of the labor force in various parts of the labor force.  We’d also tend to look broadly and inclusively at different demographic groups and not just at the headline and aggregate numbers.  So that’s a—that’s a judgment for the Committee to make.  The Committee will make a judgment that we’ve achieved labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment when it makes that—it is, admittedly, a judgment call because it’s a range of factors.  Unlike inflation, where we have one number that sort of dominates, it’s a broad range of things.  So, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, in my view, we are making rapid progress toward maximum employment.  And you see that, of course, in some of the factors that I mentioned. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Great, thank you.  Steve at CNBC. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  All right.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My question is:  If—It’s often said that monetary policy has long and variable lags.  How does continuing to buy assets now, even though it’s at a slower pace, address the current inflation problem?  Won’t the impact of today’s changes not really have any impact for six months or a year down the road on the current inflation problem?  And aren’t you actually lengthening that time by continuing to buy assets  December 15, 2021  such that it could be not until the long and variable lag after you end purchases sometime in   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, on the first part of your question, which is, “Why not stop purchasing now?,” I would just say this:  We’ve learned that, in dealing with balance sheet issues, we’ve learned that it’s best to take a careful sort of methodical approach to make adjustments.  Markets can be sensitive to it.  And we thought that this was—this was a doubling of the speed.  We’re basically two meetings away now from finishing the taper.  And we thought that was the appropriate way to go.  So we announced it, and that’s what will happen.   You know, the question of long and variable lags is, is an interesting one.  That’s, that’s Milton Friedman’s famous statement.  And I do think that in this world, where everything is—where the global financial markets are connected together, financial conditions can change very quickly.  And my own sense is that they get into—financial conditions affect the economy fairly rapidly, longer than the traditional thought of, you know, a year or 18 months.  Shorter than that, rather.  But in addition, when we communicate about what we’re going to do, the markets move immediately [in response] to that.  So financial conditions are changing to reflect, you know, the forecasts that we made and basically, which was, I think, fairly in line with what markets were expecting.  But financial conditions don’t wait to change until, until things actually happen.  They, they change on the expectation of things happening.  So I don’t think it’s a question of 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Can I just follow up?  Thinking about having to wait, is it still the policy, or the position, of the Committee that you will not raise rates until the taper is complete?  having to wait. Thank you.  December 15, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  The sense of that, of course, being that buying assets is adding accommodation and raising rates is removing accommodation.  Since we’re two meetings away from completing the taper, assuming things go as, as expected, I think if we wanted to lift off before then, then, then what we—you would stop the taper potentially sooner.  But it’s not something I expect to happen.  But I do—I do not think it would be appropriate, and we—and we don’t find ourselves in a situation where we—where we might have to raise rates while we’re still purchasing assets. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, let’s go to Colby at the FT. 

[SECTION]

COLBY SMITH.  Thank you, Michelle.  Chair Powell, I’m curious exactly how much distance you think there should be between the end of the taper and the first interest rate increase.  Back in 2014, the guidance was—that was given was for the fed funds rate to remain at the target level for a considerable time after the end of the asset purchase program.  Is that an approach you support now?   Or does the current economic situation warrant something a bit different?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we, we haven’t made any decision of that nature.  And so, no, I wouldn’t say that’s our position at all.  We really haven’t taken a position on that.  I will say that we did talk today–We had our first discussion about the balance sheet, for example.  And we went through the way—the sequence of events regarding the runoff and that sort of thing with the balance sheet, last time.  And I think people thought that was an interesting discussion.  They thought that it was informative, but people pointed out that this is a significantly different economic situation that we have at the current time, and that those—the differences that we see now would tend to influence how we think about the balance sheet.  And the same thing would be true about raising rates.  I don’t—I don’t foresee that there would be that kind of very  December 15, 2021  extended wait at this time.  The economy is so much stronger.  I was here at the Fed when we   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL lifted off the last time.  And the economy is so much stronger now, so much closer to full employment.  Inflation is running well above target, and growth is well above potential.  There wouldn’t be the need for that kind of long delay.  Having said that, I—you know, we’ll make this focused on yet. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you, Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, in March you answered a question about maximum employment like this:  You said 4 percent  would be a nice unemployment rate to get to, but it’ll take more than that to get to maximum employment.  More recently, you have hinted at a possible distinction between the level of maximum employment that’s achievable in the short run versus in the long run.  Has your view of the level of maximum employment changed this year?  And if so, how?  And how close is the economy right now to your judgment of the short-run level of maximum employment?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So the—you know, the thing is, we’re not going back to the same economy we had in February of 2020.  And I think early on, that was—the sense was that that’s where we were headed.  The post-pandemic labor market, and the economy in general, will be different.  And the maximum level of employment that’s consistent with price stability evolves over time within a—within a business cycle and over a longer period, in part reflecting [the] evolution of the factors that affect labor supply, including those related to the pandemic.  So I would say:  Look, we’re, we’re at 4.2 percent now and it’s been—the unemployment rate has been dropping very quickly.  So we’re already in the vicinity of 4 percent.    December 15, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL The way in which—The important metric that has been disappointing really has been labor force participation, of course, where we had widely thought—I had certainly thought—that, last fall, as unemployment insurance ran off, as vaccinations increased, [and] as schools reopened, that we would see a significant surge, if you will, or at least a surge, in labor force participation.  So we’ve begun to see some improvement.  We certainly welcome the 2/10 improvement that we got in the November report.  But I do think that it’s—it feels likely now that the return to higher participation is going to take longer.  And, in fact, that’s, that’s been the pattern in past cycles—that labor force participation has tended to recover in the wake of a strong recovery in unemployment, which is what we’re getting right now.  So you—it could well have been that this cycle was different because of the short nature of it and the very strong—the number of job openings, for example, you would have thought that that would have pulled people back in.  But, really, it’s the pandemic, it’s a range of factors.  But the reality is, we don’t have a strong labor force participation recovery yet, and we may not have it for some time.  At the same time, we have to make policy now.  And inflation is well above target.  So this is something we need to take into—take into account. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  If I could—if I could follow up, you’ve talked recently about risk management.  And so does that mean that the Committee might feel compelled to raise interest rates before you’re convinced that you’ve achieved the employment test in your forward guidance? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So this is—this is not at all a decision that the Committee has made.  But you’re really asking a question about how our framework works.  And, yes, there is a—there’s a provision, it used to be called the “balanced approach” provision, that says, in effect, that in situations in which the pursuit of the maximum-employment goal and [the pursuit of] the  December 15, 2021  price-stability goal are not complementary, we have to take account of the distance from the goal   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   and the—and the speed at which we’re approaching it.  And so that is, in effect, an “off-ramp” which could, in concept, be taken and it’s in our framework, it’s been in our framework a long time.  I’ve talked about it on a number of occasions.  It, it is a provision that would enable us to, in this case, because of high inflation, move before achieving maximum employment.  Now, we’re—as I said, we’re making rapid progress toward maximum employment in my—in my thinking, in my opinion.  And I don’t at all know that we will—that we’ll have to invoke that, that paragraph.  But just as a factual matter, that is part of our framework—and has been, really, for a very long time. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thanks.  We’ll go to Howard at Reuters. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks, as usual.  So I guess I gotta ask about the elephant in the room, which is the Omicron variant.  You know, this seems to already be pushing one of your colleagues, the Bank of England, off its course.  Things have evolved very fast there.  Hasn’t quite hit the shores of the U.S. in full force yet.  But people seem to expect it to.  So I’m wondering, in your feelings about this, are you convinced that this is going to be perhaps a more infectious, but less serious, variant of the virus?  Or are you simply confident that the U.S. economy can continue its divorce from the pandemic? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think there’s a lot of uncertainty, which is why we—why we called it out in our statement, our postmeeting statement, as a risk.  It’s—we, we follow the same experts and I—we, we talk privately to the same experts that everyone else does and read the same articles in the paper and the same research and, you know, so the—you mentioned the early assessment is highly transmissible, perhaps not as severe, some continuing protection from, from  December 15, 2021  existing vaccines and also existing immunity from having had the disease.  That’s a first draft.    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL We’re a long way from knowing what it will turn out to be.  It may well come to the United States and replace Delta as the dominant variant fairly quickly.  That could easily happen.  I think there’s another step there, though—which is what’s going to be the effect on the economy.  And that will depend, you know, on how much it suppresses demand as opposed to suppressing supply.  It is not clear how big the effects would be on either inflation or growth or hiring on top of what’s already going on, which is quite a strong, you know, wave of Delta that’s hitting large parts of the country across the northern United States and all the way to the eastern seaboard and now coming down.  We’re having quite a wave of Delta.  So coming in on top of that, again, it’s very difficult to say what the economic effects would be.  I do think, wave upon wave, people are learning to live with this.  More and more people are getting vaccinated.  So [vaccinated] people who get the new variant, it affects them much less than it tends to affect, in the aggregate, people who are not vaccinated.  So the more people get vaccinated, the less the economic effect.  It doesn’t mean it won’t have an economic effect.  Delta had an effect of slowing down hiring.  And it actually—it had an effect on global supply chains.  And that sort of—that hurt the process of the global supply chains getting worked out.  So it can have an economic effect.  I just think, at this point, we don’t know much.  We’ll know a whole lot more in three weeks, and we’ll know more than that in six weeks. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  But if I can follow up:  You’re clearly, sort of from a risk standpoint, comfortable putting away one of your tools pretty soon.  Which sort of implies that whatever Omicron brings, you’re comfortable the economy can handle it without quantitative easing.  December 15, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  Yes, look, I think—if you look at the state of the economy and the amount—the strength of demand, the strength of just overall demand, and the strength of demand for labor, look at inflation, look at wages.  I think moving, you know, moving forward the end of our taper by a few months is really—is really an appropriate thing to do.  And I think, really, Omicron doesn’t really have much to do with that. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Jeanna at the New York Times. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hey, Chairman Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what prompted your recent pivot toward greater wariness around inflation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So I guess I would go back and—you know, it’s been a continual process, really.  Inflation really popped up, right?   In the late spring last year.  And we had a view—it was very, very widely held in the forecasting community—that this would be temporary.  It was quite narrow, you know, a limited number of factors were causing it.  And there was a decent amount of evidence to support that view, that it would be temporary or transitory, as we said.  Certainly, we had five months of declining month on month—monthly readings of inflation, but we didn’t see much in the way of progress on labor supply or on other supply-side issues.  Then in September, I’d say after Labor Day, we started to see—it started to become clear that this was both larger in its effect on inflation and more persistent.  And, of course, I said so on many occasions, and one of the consequences of that is that we move the taper forward.  We moved the taper forward and we—and it’s a much faster taper than had been planned.  So we’ve been adapting—I’ve been saying we’re adapting our policy.   December 15, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL So coming to your real question, we got the ECI reading on the eve of the November meeting—it was the Friday before the November meeting—and it was very high, 5.7 percent reading for the employment compensation index for the third quarter, not annualized, for the third quarter, just before the meeting.  And I thought for a second there whether we—whether we should increase our taper,  [We] decided to go ahead with what we had—what we had “socialized.”  Then, right after that, we got the next Friday after the meeting, two days after the meeting, we got a very strong employment report and, you know, revisions to prior readings and, and no increase in labor supply.  And the Friday after that, we got the CPI, which was a very hot, high reading.  And I, honestly, at that point, really decided that I thought we needed to—we needed to look at, at speeding up the taper.  And we went to work on that.  So that’s, that’s really what happened.  It was essentially higher inflation and faster—turns out much faster progress in the labor market.  Really, what’s happening is the unemployment rate is catching up—seems to be catching up—with a lot of the other readings of a tight labor market, 6/10 [decline] over one cycle.  So that’s really what happened and, you know, widely supported in the Committee today, as you can see—unanimous vote—but beyond that I think widely, widely supported, you know, this, this move. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  If I could just follow up quickly, you noted that the ECI was one of the things that made you nervous, but you also said earlier that you don’t see signs that wages are actually factoring into inflation yet.  And I guess I wonder how you think about sort of the wage picture as, as you’re making these assessments. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So—but I said—you, you quoted me correctly.  It’s, it’s—so far, we don’t see—wages are not a big part of the high-inflation story that we’re seeing.  As you look forward, let’s assume that the goods economy does sort itself out, and supply chains get  December 15, 2021  working again, and maybe there’s a rebalancing back to services and all that kind of thing.  But   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   what, what that leaves behind is the other things that can lead to persistent inflation.  In particular—we don’t see this yet, but if you had something where wages were persistently—[increases in] real wages were persistently above productivity growth, that puts upward pressure on, on firms, and they raise prices.  It would take something that was persistent and material for that to happen.  And we don’t see that yet.  But with the kind of hot labor market readings—wages we’re seeing, it’s something that we’re—that we’re watching.  And the other thing, of course, is, is rents, which are very important.  You know, owners’ equivalent rent.  That’s another thing which is very economically sensitive.  Unlike the things that are causing the inflation now, this is economically sensitive—and so would be expected to move up.  And so as the—as some things go down, the question is:  Where will we be when we come out the other side of this?  And we need to keep our eyes on those things. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thanks.  We’ll go to Chris at the AP. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Thank you.  Well, next year, you could see growth slowing, and you could see some disinflation, particularly if the Omicron variant does spread more widely.  Would you delay rate hikes in that situation?  And how would you think about that?  And also, how would you explain rate hikes if you do follow through, in that kind of situation, with inflation fading and growth slowing?  How would you explain rate hikes to the public, particularly those who may still be looking for work? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, as you know, you know, the SEP is not a plan.  It’s not something we debate, negotiate over, or really discuss in terms of what the right answer should be.  People write down their, their assumptions—their assessment of appropriate policy based on  December 15, 2021  their economic forecast.  And so the median—what you’re talking about, the three rate increases,   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   that’s the median of the Committee—the median of the Committee is also that growth will be 4 percent and then unemployment will be 3½ percent by the end of the year.  So that’s a really strong economy.  And, of course, if the—if the economy turns out to be quite different from that, then so will the rate.  You know, we—no one will say, “Oh, we can’t change our policy because we wrote something down in December.”  No one’s ever said that or will.  It will—the actual rate decisions we make will depend on our evolving assessment of the forecast.  So, for example, if, if the economy were to slow down significantly, then you would expect that that would have an effect of slowing down rate increases.  But we’d have to—you know, we look at our two goals, maximum employment and price stability, and we make policy based on them, and not with respect to what we wrote down in a prior SEP. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Victoria Guida at Politico. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I wanted to follow up on maximum employment.  So, you know, the new framework was basically designed, as I understand it, so that there was a de-emphasis on guessing where inflation would pick up because of employment.  And, basically, you were going to wait until you saw the whites of the eyes of inflation.  And that’s how you would kind of know that you reached maximum employment.  So, I’m wondering, you know, you’ve talked a lot about the different ways that you might measure maximum employment.  But from what I understand, that’s still basically:  The way that you know that you’re there is inflation.  So is that understanding correct?  And how is—are those signals likely to be clear right now given that you have inflation that’s caused by, you know, these supply chain disruptions that might also lead to, you know, inflation in wages and those sorts of things?  So how do you sort of, like, tease out the signal of maximum employment?  December 15, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  So let me start by saying that the inflation that we got was not at all the inflation we were looking for or talking about in the framework.  This was—it really was a completely different thing.  It was to do with, you know, strong monetary policy and fiscal stimulus into an economy that was recovering rapidly, and in which there were these supply-side barriers which effectively led to, you know, in certain parts of the economy, what you might call a vertical supply curve.  So, you know, automobile purchases are very interest rate-sensitive, and you would think demand would drive up the quantity of cars,  But it can’t, because they don’t have semiconductors.  So, so that—it was a very different kind of inflation.  This is not the inflation we were looking for under our framework at all.  It’s nothing to do with our framework.  And our—the way we’ve approached it is really nothing to do with our framework. But coming to maximum employment, which is really your question.  How do you know?  So I think you look at, you know, prices and quantities.  When you—if you want to look at maximum employment, you look at prices and quantities, and the main price you look at is wages.  It’s one of the things you look at.  And, you know, it’s—So I mentioned a number of other things.  You can get to 20, if you wanted to, easily, but labor force participation, the unemployment rate, different age groups of—you know, prime-age labor force participation, in particular, gets a lot of focus, the JOLTS data get a lot of focus.  And wages, that’s, that’s really one of the great signals.  The quits rate is another one.  The quits rate is really one of the very best indicators, according to a lot of labor economists, because people quit because they feel like they can get a better job.  And there’s, you know, record amounts, historically high levels of that going on—suggesting, again, that you’ve got a very tight labor market.  So on wages, that’s the price indicator we look at to tell us, along with all the other data, whether we’re—whether we have labor market conditions that are consistent with maximum  December 15, 2021  employment.  And so that’s, that’s how we think about it.  But the—one of the complications is   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   that, again, we’ve got to make policy in real time.  So how do we think about that?  Do we—if we think we can make labor, you know, participation might move up—if we, let’s say we knew that it would start to move up in two years, would we wait two years when inflation is running way above target?  Probably not, you know, so you have to make an assessment that what’s max—what is the level of maximum employment that is consistent with price stability in real time is, is one way to think about it. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Just to kind of follow up on that for a second, if you do raise interest rates next year and, you know, it’s—you’re not certain whether you’re at maximum employment, are you all going to point—when you raise interest rates, are you going to point to ways in which the labor market could still improve? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  I mean, I—absolutely.  I, I think—well, whether or not we—whether or not we say “we’re at conditions—labor market conditions consistent with, with maximum employment” next year, we would all be open and I think expect, over time, that the level of maximum employment that’s consistent with price stability would increase further over time—for example, through increasing participation.  So I—we would certainly—we would not, in any way, want to foreclose the idea that the labor market can get even better.  But, again, with inflation as high as it is, we have to make policy in real time.  We’ve got to make that assessment in real time. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Olivia from Bloomberg. 

[SECTION]

OLIVIA ROCKEMAN.  Thank you.  Good afternoon, Chair Powell, and thank you for taking our questions.  I wanted to follow up on some of your earlier comments about labor force participation.  And I wondered, what do you think needs to change in the economy to kind of get  December 15, 2021  a meaningful recovery in labor force participation, and also whether running the economy hot,   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL like in the last expansion, is one way of doing that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, the labor market is, by so many measures, hotter than it ever ran in the last—in the last expansion, if you think about it.  You know, the ratio of job openings, for example, to, to vacancies is at all-time highs.  Quits, the wages—all those things are, are even hotter.  But what would it take for labor force participation to move up more?  You know, that’s—really, “Why is it low?” is the question.  So there, there are a bunch of answers, and all of them probably have some, you know, some validity.  Part of it will be that people—for certain people, they don’t want to go back in the labor force because either they’re medically vulnerable or they’re not comfortable going back while COVID is still everywhere.  That’s one thing.  The lack of availability of childcare made for caretakers is certainly part of it—not just for children, but for older people.  It has been pointed out by many that the stock market is high, people’s portfolios are stronger—they may go back to being a one-income rather than a two-income family.  The same thing with people’s houses.  People buy—they have a mortgage, you know, with leverage, and the house price increases, the equity they have in their home might have doubled.  And they might make—reach the same conclusion.  So they’re—and people have savings on their balance sheet because of forced savings because they couldn’t spend on travel and things like that and also because of, you know, because of government transfers.   So, for all of those reasons—and it’s hard to know exactly the part each of them plays—we, we have a situation where we’ve had a shock to labor force participation that is not unwinding as quickly as, as many, as expected.  And people—in effect, a good part of it is voluntary.  You know, people—and this is how they want to maximize their welfare and that’s, that’s their, certainly their choice.  In other cases, it’s something that will abate very quickly if  December 15, 2021  and when the pandemic gets under control.  And the longer the pandemic goes on, you know,   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL their new life and they lose contact with their old jobs.  That’s, that’s what the evidence would say.   So it’s a range of things.  It isn’t that the economy lacks stimulus.  You know, usually, in every other expansion, it’s that there aren’t enough jobs and people can’t find jobs and, you know, we’re stimulating demand and trying to get demand to come up.  That’s not the problem here.  The problem is a supply-side problem, which—what it would take to work it out, I think it’s going to be time.  And the number-one thing would, would really be to have the pandemic get under control.  That’s what everyone would really like to see:  What does the labor force—what does the labor market look like in a world without COVID?  That would be the thing that we’d really like to see but, you know, it doesn’t look like that’s coming anytime soon. 

[SECTION]

OLIVIA ROCKEMAN.  And just to quickly follow up on that:  If some of the reason that labor force participation isn’t back to, you know, February 2020 levels is because people are voluntarily making life decisions that are different, does that make you think we’re going to end up at a lower rate overall?

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, there’s a demographic trend underlying all of this.  And we actually got above the demographic trend at the end of the last expansion.  But—so one would expect over time that labor force participation would, would move down because an aging population, the older people are, the lower their participation rate is.  So you would expect that, that the trend would be lower and that, over time, participation would move down.   The question of how much we can get back up closer to where we were in February of 2020—and, indeed, for the year or so before that—is a good one.  And, I mean, I—What we can  December 15, 2021  do is try to create the conditions.  There’s a lot of good for society when you have a tight but   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL stable labor market, where people are coming in, they’re getting into the labor force, they’re getting paid well.  In the labor market we had before, we had, you know—the biggest wage increases were going to people at the bottom end of the wage spectrum for the last couple of years.  There were just a lot of really desirable aspects of a labor market like that.  Higher participation is one of them.  And we’d love to get back there.  But, again, ultimately, we have the tools that we have, which are essentially to stimulate demand and also to control inflation.  I mean, really, it might be—one of the two big threats to getting back to maximum employment is actually high inflation, because, to get back to where we were, the evidence grows that it’s going to take some time.  And what we need is another long expansion, like the ones we’ve been having.  Over the last 40 years, we’ve had, I think, three of the four longest in our recorded history, including the last one, which was the longest in our recorded history.  That’s what it would really take to get back to the kind of labor market we’d like to see.  And to have that happen, we need to make sure that we maintain price stability. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, let’s go to Edward Lawrence at Fox. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thanks.  Thanks, Michelle, and thanks for taking the question, Chair Powell.  So I was looking at the consensus data for estimated monthly changes on sales.  And what you’re seeing is fewer people spending at restaurants and drinking places, more people spending at grocery stores.  You see electronic sales down 4.6 percent month over month, also department store sales down 5.4 percent month over month.  How concerned or what is your level of concern the consumer may be turning away from this economy or pulling back because of inflation, the virus, or something else?  Thank you.  December 15, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We see consumer expense as very strong in this quarter.  I don’t know, Edward, whether you’re talking about more shopping online versus shopping in the store, but consumer demand is very strong, incomes are very strong, you know, because people are going back to work and they’re getting wage increases.  Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation.  But, nonetheless, incomes, overall, are going up really significantly because of increased employment and spending is—has been strong.  There may be something in the seasonality that this year’s holiday spending may have been pulled forward.  And, of course, there may be effects from, from Delta and there might be going forward from Omicron.  But fundamentally, though, the consumer is really healthy, and we expect personal consumption expenditures to be pretty strong in the fourth quarter. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, let’s go to Mike at Bloomberg. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, the median forecast for inflation in this month’s or this meeting’s economic projections has been revised up significantly for 2021 but barely moved for 2022 and 2023.  You’ve said you expect inflation to fall significantly.  Is that because you’re going to raise interest rates or because the virus is going to fade and the effects are going to fade?  In other words, is it a question of when, not if, you raise interest rates?  And does it suggest that  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, actually, I’m looking at the SEP here, and the median forecasts for core and headline inflation did move up by 4/10 each.  So that’s a significant—you know, in an SEP, that’s a pretty significant move up.  You know, it’s, it’s based on both of those things, I suppose.  I do think there’s a broad expectation among forecasters, including our own, that the bottlenecks will alleviate sometime over the course of this year.  If you look at where Blue Chip forecasts are—which is, you know, a group of well-resourced, large forecasting operations with a  December 15, 2021  long track record—they’ll show inflation coming back down significantly toward the back-end   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL of next year.   case.   I would say, though, as well that our policy should begin to have an effect.  There will be a lag, but it should begin to have an effect on that as well.  And, you know, that’s the most likely I guess what—the thing I would want to say, though, is we can’t act as though that’s a certainty, and we’re not going to act as though that’s a certainty.  There’s a real risk now, we believe, I believe, that inflation may be more persistent and that may be putting inflation expectations under pressure, and that the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched has increased.  It’s certainly increased.  I don’t think it’s high at this moment, but I think it’s increased.  And I think that’s part of the reason behind our move today.  [It] is to put ourselves in a position to be able to deal with that risk.  And I think we are in a position to deal with that risk.  We need to see more data.  We need to see how the inflation data and the—all the data evolve in coming months, but we are prepared to, you know, to use our tools to make sure that higher inflation doesn’t get entrenched.  For one reason, as I—as I just mentioned, it’s one of the two big threats, the other being the pandemic itself, to getting back to maximum employment. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Michael Derby at the Wall Street Journal. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Yeah.  Thanks for taking my question.  So as the Fed shifts towards an accelerated taper, I wonder what your read is on financial-stability risks right now.  I mean, these periods can be—you know, it seems like the taper process has gone fairly smooth so far.  But, you know, what do you see in terms of stability risks?  Are there any parts of the financial sector that concern you right now?  And are there any significant systemic issues that are on your radar, you know, maybe from the cryptocurrency sector or something like that?  December 15, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we have—we have had now for a decade and more a four-part financial stability framework that we use so we can—we can hold ourselves to the same kind of framework and, you know, not just treat each event individually.  And there are four key areas:  asset valuations, debt owed by households and businesses, funding risk, and leverage among financial institutions.  So I would say asset valuations—I’m going to go really superficially here, but asset valuations are somewhat elevated, I would say.  Debt owed by businesses, you know, and households—households are in very strong financial shape.  Businesses actually have a lot of debt, but their default rates are very, very low.  But, nonetheless, it’s something we’re watching.  Funding risk is, by and large, low among, among financial institutions.  But we do see money market funds as a vulnerability and, and, you know, would applaud the SEC’s action this week.  Leverage among financial institutions is low, in the sense that [their] capital is high.  So, overall, you know, financial stability, that’s how—I wouldn’t make an overall characteristic, but we break it down into those pieces.   In terms of the things, you know, that we’re—that we’re looking for, looking at, you know, it’s the—it’s the things we’ve already talked about, to some extent.  It’s, it’s the emergence of a new variant that could, you know, that could lead to significant economic—if there were to be a variant, for example, [and if] that were quite resistant to vaccines, it could have another significant effect on the economy.  We don’t see that.  We don’t have any basis for thinking that the new variant that we have is that one, but it’s certainly one we’re looking at.  I would say, you know, cyber risk, the risk of a successful cyberattack, is, for me, you know, always the most—you know, one that would be very difficult to deal with.  I think we know how to deal with bad loans and things like that.  I think more—a cyberattack that were to take down a major financial institution or financial market utility would be a really significant financial  December 15, 2021  stability risk that we haven’t actually faced yet.  So I could go on with a list of “horribles,” but I   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   think that’s a decent picture of where I would start. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  How about the cryptocurrency issues?  Anything that worries you there that’s going on in there in terms of—you know, obviously a lot’s happening in that sector.  Does that concern you at all? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I think the concerns there are not so much current financial-stability concerns.  I, of course, would support the, the views expressed in the President’s Working Group report on stablecoins.  Stablecoins can certainly be a useful, efficient, consumer-serving, part of the financial system, if they’re properly regulated.  And, right now, they aren’t.  And, and they have the potential to scale [up], particularly if they were to be, you know, associated with one of the very large tech networks that exist and you could have a payment network that was immediately systemically important—close to immediately systemically important that didn’t have appropriate regulation and protections.  The public relies on the government—and [on] the Fed, in particular—to make sure that the payment system is safe and reliable, as well as the dollar and—you know, to provide a safe and reliable trusted currency.  So—but I do think those are longer term.   In terms of, you know, the more—the cryptocurrencies, you know, that are really speculative assets, I don’t see them as a financial-stability concern at the moment.  I do think they are risky, they’re not backed by anything, and I think there’s big consumer—issues for consumers who may or may not understand what they’re getting.  And there’s certainly developments in the—in the markets that are worth following, which are really not in our jurisdiction, but things like, you know, the kind of leverage that’s built into and those sorts of things is certainly worth, worth watching.  December 15, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer at Marketplace. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Chair Powell.  Hi, Chair Powell, thanks for the question.  Going back to inflation, is the Fed “behind the curve” on getting inflation under control? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I would say this.  I actually think we are well positioned to deal with, with what’s coming, with the range of plausible outcomes that can come.  I do.  And I think if you look at how we got here, I do think we’ve, we’ve been adapting to the incoming data, really all the way along, and, you know, noticing and calling out that, that the—both the effects and the persistence of inflation of bottlenecks and labor shortages and things like that.  So we’ve been calling out the fact that those were becoming longer, and more persistent, and larger.  And now we’re in a position where we’re ending our taper within the next—well, by March, in two meetings, and we’ll be in a position to raise interest rates as and when we think it’s appropriate.  And we will, if that—to the extent that’s appropriate.  At the same time, we’re going to be seeing a few more months of data.  I don’t actually think we’re out of position now.  I think this was an important move for us to make.  I think that the data that we got toward the end of the fall was a—was a really strong signal that inflation is more persistent and higher—and that the risk of it remaining higher for longer has grown.  And I think we’re reacting to that now.  And we’ll continue to adapt our policy.  So I wouldn’t look at it that we’re “behind the curve.”  I would look at it that we’re actually in position now to take the steps that we’ll need to take, you know, in a thoughtful manner to address all of the issues, including that of, of too-high inflation. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Evan at Market News. 

[SECTION]

EVAN RYSER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you.  I was wondering if we should still be seeing the taper and interest rate hikes as separate.  And, secondly, in the last cycle, the Fed  December 15, 2021  started shrinking the balance sheet when short-term interest rates were about 1 to 1¼ percent   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL range.  Do you think the FOMC might be able to potentially start running off assets before that this time? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Are they separate?  So our interest rate—I mean, they are separate tools.  So the—you know, the, the asset purchases are a separate tool from interest rates.  Stopping asset purchases does not remove accommodation.  It just stops adding further accommodation.  Whereas raising interest rates starts to remove accommodation from what is a highly accommodative stance.  You know, the extent to which they’ll be separated in time is, is something we haven’t really discussed at the Committee [meetings] yet.  We will be discussing that, obviously, in coming meetings.  I don’t think that, that—the last cycle, there was quite a long separation before interest rates.  I don’t think that’s at all likely in this cycle.  We’re in a very, very different place with high inflation, strong growth, a really strong economy.  You know, that—as I mentioned, the SEP medians are for 4 percent growth next year, 3½ percent—3½ percent unemployment at the end of the year, and the, the—you know, headline inflation of 2.6 percent next year, core at 2.7.  So this is a strong economy, one in which it’s appropriate for, for interest rate hikes.  So they’re separate, I would say.  Your—sorry, your second question was? 

[SECTION]

EVAN RYSER.  My second question was about runoff. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Runoff. 

[SECTION]

EVAN RYSER.  In the last cycle. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, with the balance sheet, we did have a balance sheet discussion, sort of a prelim—a first, first discussion of balance sheet issues today, [balance] sheet issues, at our meeting this week.  We’ll have another at the next meeting and another at the  December 15, 2021  meeting after that I suspect.  These are interesting issues to discuss.  [We] didn’t make any   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL interesting and informative.  And—but to one degree or another, people noted that this is just a different situation, and those differences should inform the decisions we make about the balance sheet this time.  So [we] haven’t made any decisions at all about, about when runoff would start, but we’re—we’ll be continuing to—you know, in relation to when either liftoff happens or the end of the taper.  But those are exactly the decisions we’ll be turning to in coming meetings. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Scott Horsley at NPR. 

[SECTION]

SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  I think you said a few minutes ago that the inflation that we got during the pandemic was not the inflation that we—that you anticipated when you crafted the framework.  And you described it as a collision of a lot of monetary and fiscal stimulus with these supply-side hiccups.  Does that mean the stimulus was mistaken, or is the inflation just a consequence of—that we have to put up with because of that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  No, I’m not expressing any judgment about, about the stimulus in, in that comment.  What I’m saying is, there’s a—there’s a sense among some that “you wanted inflation, this is what you wanted, how do you like it?,” you know?  And the truth is, this is not the inflation that we were—what we were talking about in the—in the framework was inflation that comes from a tight labor market, right?  So we had 3½ percent unemployment for a period, and we had inflation that was just barely getting to 2 percent.  And I—you know, I think, in that setting, our thinking was, we can afford to wait to raise rates until we see actual inflation rather than [acting] preemptive[ly] because, you know, no one had seen what 3½ percent unemployment would look like—with high labor force participation, by the way.  No one had seen what it would look—really look like for an extended period, for decades.  And we didn’t  December 15, 2021  know what the inflationary implications were.  It turned out there was barely 2 percent   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL inflation—and no sense that it was gaining momentum and that kind of thing.  So we incorporated that into our framework.   This is something completely different.  You know, that’s a situation where you had a very, very high level of employment and low inflation.  This is literally the opposite.  Or, you know, it has been the opposite, where we have very high inflation and we’ve had it since the labor market was in terrible shape.  It had nothing—so far, this inflation has really nothing to do with tightness in the labor market.  It does have to do with, with strong demand, and strong demand was supported by the Fed, it was supported by Congress.  I’m not making any judgments on Congress, it’s not my job.  But I will just say, we’re coming out of a, you know, what we certainly hope will be a once in a lifetime, certainly historic—the first really global modern pandemic—which looked at the beginning like it might cause a global depression.  And, you know, so we threw a lot of support at it [the economy].  And what’s coming out now is, is, you know, really strong growth, really strong demand, high incomes, and all that kind of thing.  You know, people will judge in 25 years whether we—whether we overdid it or not, but, you know, the reality is, we are where we are.  And, you know, we think our policy is, is the right one for the situation that we’re in. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Brian Cheung. 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Wanted to ask about the bond markets.  When you see the 10-year at 146 basis points, do you have any sort of concerns about an environment by which you might be hiking interest rates into?  Would you prefer the curve be a little bit steeper?  What are you gleaning from the bond market actions over the last six weeks?  December 15, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I, I think the short-end actions are easy to understand, which is, you know, they’re basically very [monetary] policy-sensitive rates at the short end, and it makes sense that it’s reacting to changes in expectations for policy.  I think a lot of things go into the, you know, the long rates.  And the place I would start is just look at global sovereign yields around the world.  Look at JGBs, look at bunds, and they’re so much lower.  You can get—you can get, you know, a much higher yield on U.S. Treasuries by buying USTs rather than bunds and you can—you can hedge, hedge the currency risk back into yen, back into euros and still be way ahead.  So, in a way, it’s not surprising that there’s a lot of demand for, for U.S. sovereigns in a world—you know, in a risk-free world where, where there’s so much—they’re yielding so much more than bunds are, than JGBs.  So that’s, that’s a big part of it.  I also think, you know, there, there may be some assessment in there of what the neutral rate is or what the terminal rate is.  I don’t know about that.  But—and I would just say that we, you know, we write down our own estimates of the—of the terminal rate or the neutral rate of interest.  Those are highly uncertain.  And, you know, we’ll make policy based on what we’re seeing in the economy rather than based on what a neutral—what a model might say the neutral rate is.  We, we all had the experience of the last cycle, where we all, through that cycle, were trying to estimate what the neutral rate was, and it turned out—you know, I think we learned a lot from seeing what happens.  We ended up cutting rates three times after raising them to 2¼ to 2½ percent.  So I’m not troubled by where the long bond [rate] is.  You know, I see that it’s low.  You know, I mean, we’re really focused on broader financial conditions, [and] we’re focused on maximum employment and price stability. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  For the last question, we’ll go to Greg Robb.  December 15, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you very much.  Chair Powell, I was wondering if—I wanted to give you the opportunity to talk about something that I’ve heard that’s been discussed—that, you know, your pivot towards a tighter policy, hawkish policy stance had something to do with the timing of your renomination by the President.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure, I’d be happy to talk about that.  So, as I mentioned, we got the ECI reading just before the November meeting.  We got the labor market report two days after the meeting.  And then, one week after that, I think on the 12th of November, we got the CPI reading.  It was really the CPI reading, in concert with those two, and I, I just came to the view over that weekend that we needed to speed up the taper.  And we started working on that.  That's a full 10 days or so before the President made a decision of renominating me.  So, honestly, it had—it had nothing to do with that at all.  And I just thought this is what we got to do.  My colleagues were out talking about the—a faster taper.  And that doesn’t happen by accident.  They were out talking about a faster taper before the President made his decision.  So it’s a were talking about it publicly.  So that’s what happened.  And it had absolutely nothing to do with it whatsoever.  We’re always going to just do what we think is the right thing, and I certainly will always just do what I think the right thing is for the economy and for the people that we serve. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Just a quick follow-up.  I guess that some people are saying that it was the, you know, the stimulus in March that was sort of over—we didn’t really need all that stimulus, and that there was talk even then that that would be a mistake and it would lead to higher inflation.  And perhaps that you didn’t push back as much as you might have otherwise.  December 15, 2021     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I didn’t push back at all.  And the reason I didn’t—and there was no—there was lots of talk about that, but not from the Fed, because that is not our job.  We are not the CBO, and we’re not elected by anybody.  So we take fiscal policy as it arrives at our front door, and we don’t comment—you know, we make our own assessments inside the Fed, but it’s really not our role.  And I think, very important, that we stay out of that business, no matter who’s in the White House, who’s in Congress.  It’s just—it’s just not our job and it’s something we avoid pretty, pretty assiduously.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Thank you, everyone.  ",Jerome Powell,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
49,2022-01-26,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability. Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept its policy interest rate near zero and stated its expectation that an increase in this rate would soon be appropriate.  The Committee also agreed to continue reducing its net asset purchases on the schedule we announced in December—bringing them to an end in early March.  As I will explain, against a backdrop of elevated inflation and a strong labor market, our policy has been adapting to the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so. Economic activity expanded at a robust pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses.  Indeed, the economy has shown great strength and resilience in the face of the ongoing pandemic.  The recent sharp rise in COVID cases associated with the Omicron variant will surely weigh on economic growth this quarter.  High-frequency indicators point to reduced spending in COVID-sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants.  And activity more broadly may also be affected as many workers are unable to report for work because of illness, quarantines, or caregiving needs. Fortunately, health experts are finding that the Omicron variant has not been as virulent as previous strains of the virus, and they expect that cases will drop off rapidly.  If the wave passes quickly, the economic effects should as well, and we would see a return to strong growth.  That said, the implications for the economy remain uncertain.  And we have not lost sight of the  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL fact that for many afflicted individuals and families, and for the health-care workers on the front lines, the virus continues to cause great hardship. The labor market has made remarkable progress and, by many measures, is very strong.  Job gains have been solid in recent months, averaging 365,000 per month over the past three months.  Over the past year, payroll employment has risen by 6.4 million jobs.  The unemployment rate has declined sharply, falling 2 percentage points over the past six months to reach 3.9 percent in December.  The improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand remains historically strong.  With constraints on labor supply, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years.  While labor force participation has edged up, it remains subdued, in part reflecting the aging of the population and retirements.  In addition, some who would otherwise would be seeking work report that they are out of the labor force because of factors related to the pandemic, including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus.  The current wave of the virus may well prolong these effects.  Over time, there are good reasons to expect some further improvements in participation and employment. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.  Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and [to] the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation.  In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term.  These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus.  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL While the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic, price increases have now spread to a broader range of goods and services.  Wages have also risen briskly, and we are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity [growth] could put upward pressure on inflation.  Like most forecasters, we continue to expect inflation to decline over the course of the year. We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  In addition, we believe that the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains is to promote a long expansion, and that will require price stability.  We are committed to our price-stability goal.  We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.  And we’ll be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations. The Fed’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  As I noted, the Committee left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and reaffirmed our plan, announced in in the labor market and inflation that is well above our 2 percent longer-run goal, the economy no longer needs sustained high levels of monetary policy support.  That is why we are phasing out our asset purchases and why we expect it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. Of course, the economic outlook remains highly uncertain.  Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires humility, recognizing that the economy evolves in  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL unexpected ways.  We’ll need to be nimble so that we can respond to the full range of plausible outcomes.  With this in mind, we will remain attentive to risks, including the risk that high inflation is more persistent than expected, and are prepared to respond as appropriate to achieve our goals. To provide greater clarity about our approach for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, today the Committee issued a set of principles that will provide a foundation for our future decisions.  [In] these high-level principles, [we] clarify that the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting monetary policy and that reducing our balance sheet will occur after the process of raising interest rates has begun.  Reductions will occur over time in a predictable manner primarily through adjustments to reinvestments so that securities roll off our balance sheet.  Over time, we intend to hold securities in the amounts needed for our ample-reserves operating framework, and in the longer run, we envision holding primarily Treasury securities. Our decisions to reduce our balance sheet will be guided by our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  In that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of the details of our approach to balance sheet management in light of economic and financial developments.  The Committee has not made decisions regarding the specific timing, pace, or other details of shrinking the balance sheet.  And we will discuss these matters in upcoming meetings and provide additional information at the appropriate time. To conclude:  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  For the first question, we’ll go to Chris Rugaber at the Associated Press. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Thanks, Michelle.  And thank you, Chair Powell.  So it’s expected that the Fed will hike rates perhaps every other meeting, but certainly in the past, the Fed has hiked at every meeting.  So I just wanted to ask, you know, are rate hikes at consecutive meetings on the table this year?  Is every meeting a live—a live meeting?  And, on that note, would the Fed consider front-loading some of its rate hikes, even if it doesn’t raise at every meeting?  Thank you.

CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks.  So, as I—as I referred to in my opening statement, it’s—it is not possible to predict with much confidence exactly what path for our policy rate is going to prove appropriate.  And so, at this time, we haven’t made any decisions about the path of policy.  And I stress again that we’ll be humble and nimble.  We’re going to have to navigate crosscurrents and actually two-sided risks now.  So—and, and I’ll say also that we’re going to be guided by the data.  In fact, what I’ll say is that we’re going to be led by the incoming data and the evolving outlook, which we’ll try to communicate as clearly as possible, moving steadily and transparency—transparently. So more to your question, we know that the economy is in a very different place than it was when we began raising rates in 2015.  Specifically, the economy is now much stronger.  The labor market is far stronger.  Inflation is running well above our 2 percent target, much higher than it was at that time.  And these differences are likely to have important implications for the appropriate pace of policy adjustments.  Beyond that, we haven’t made any decisions. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Victoria Guida at Politico.  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I wanted to ask, you were talking about the health of the labor market.  And I’m curious whether you would characterize where we’re at right now as maximum employment.  And also, along those same lines, obviously rate hikes [are] on the table this year, do you think that the Fed can raise rates, bring inflation under control without hurting jobs and wages? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sorry.  Just getting both, both parts of your question written down.  So I would say—and this view is widely held on the Committee—that both sides of the mandate are calling for us to move steadily away from the very highly accommodative policies we put in place during the challenging economic conditions that the economy faced earlier in the pandemic.  And I would say that most FOMC participants agree that labor market conditions are consistent with maximum employment in the sense of the highest level of employment that is consistent with price stability.  And that is—that is my personal view.  And, and, again, very broad support on the Committee for the judgment that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. The other thing is, maximum employment will, will evolve over time and through the course of the business cycle.  In the particular situation we’re in now, it may well increase.  Max—the level of maximum—of employment that’s consistent with stable prices may increase.  And we hope that it will, as more people come back into the labor market, as participation gradually rises.  And the policy path that we’re broadly contemplating would be supportive of that comment—that outcome as well. So the thing about the labor market right now is that there are—there are many millions of, of more job openings than there are unemployed people.  So you ask whether we can—whether we can raise rates and, and move to less accommodative, and even tight, financial  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL conditions without hurting the labor market.  I think there’s quite a bit of room to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market.  This is, by so many measures, a historically tight labor market.  Record levels of job openings, of quits.  Wages are moving up at the highest pace they have in decades.  If you look at surveys of workers, they find jobs plentiful.  Look at surveys of companies—they find workers scarce.  And all of those readings are at levels, really, that we haven’t seen in a long time—and, in some cases, ever.  So this is a very, very strong labor market, and my strong sense is that we can—we can—we can move rates up without, without having to, you know, severely undermine it. I also would point out that there are—there are other forces at work this year, which should also help bring down inflation, we hope, including improvement on the supply side, which will ultimately come.  The timing and pace of that are uncertain.  And also, fiscal policy is going to be less supportive of, of growth this year—not of the level of economic activity, but the fiscal impulse to growth will be significantly lower.  So there are multiple forces—which should be working over the course of the year for inflation to come down.  We do realize that the timing and pace of that are, are highly uncertain and that inflation has persisted longer than we—than we thought.  And, of course, we’re prepared to use our tools to assure that higher inflation does not become entrenched. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Good afternoon, Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  I, I have a couple of questions on the balance sheet.  The statement on the balance sheet today calls for “significantly reducing” your holdings.  What does that mean?  And then, apart from moving sooner and faster to shrink the holdings, are there any other ways in which you and your colleagues are seriously thinking about recalibrating this process?  And, finally, how much  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL disagreement is there around how you should use this tool, including active sales rather than passive sales or changes in the composition of reinvestments?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I’m afraid to tell you that those are all great questions, and they’re questions that the Committee is just turning to now.  So we had—we had a discussion, as you know, at the last meeting, an introductory discussion of the balance sheet and a teeing up of the issues.  At this meeting, we’ve gone through and carefully put together a set of principles at a high level.  And those are meant to guide the actual decisions we’ll make about the pace and about all of the questions that you’re, you’re asking. And I expect that this process will, will be something that we spend time on in coming meetings.  I can’t tell you how many.  I can’t tell you how long it will take.  But—and then, you know, at the appropriate time, we’ll provide additional information.  So I did—the last cycle when we—when we went through balance sheet issues, we did find that over, over the course of two or three meetings, for example, we did come to interesting and better answers, we thought.  So we’re just in that process now.  And at the next meeting, we’ll be turning to, you know, more of the details that you’re—that you’re asking about. I would say this.  The balance sheet is, is much bigger.  I’d say it has a shorter duration than the last time.  And the economy’s much stronger, and inflation is much higher.  So—and I think that leads you to—and I said, I’ve said this—being willing to move sooner than we did the last time and also perhaps faster.  But beyond that, it’s really—it’s really not appropriate for me to speculate exactly what that would be.  And, and—but I would point you to principle number one, which is “the Committee views changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.”  So we do want the federal funds rate—we, we want to operationalize that [as the primary means].  And we want the balance sheet  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL to be declining in a predictable manner, and we want it to be declining primarily by adjusting reinvestments. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  So, if I could follow on that, raising rates and reducing the balance sheet both restrain the economy, both tighten monetary policy.  How should we think about the relationship between the two?  For example, how much passive runoff is equal to every ¼ percentage point increase in your benchmark rate? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, again, we think of the balance sheet as, as moving in a predictable manner, sort of in the background, and that the active tool meeting to meeting is not both of them, it’s the federal funds rate.  There are—there are rules of thumb—I’m reluctant to land on one of them—that, that equate this.  And—but there’s also an element of, of uncertainty around the balance sheet.  I think we have a much better sense, frankly, of how rate increases affect financial conditions and, hence, economic conditions.  Balance sheet [policy] is, is still a relatively new thing for, for the markets and for us, so we’re less certain about that. So, again, our—I think our—the pattern we’ll follow is to—is to arrive at a, you know, a timing and a pace and composition and all those things and then announce that with advance notice, and, and it will—it will start in the background.  And then we’ll look to have that just running in the background and have—and have the interest rates, again, be the active tool of monetary policy.  That’s, that’s at least the plan.  I can’t tell you much more about any of the—any of the very good issues about size, pace, composition, those sorts of things.  But we’ll be turning to all of those at coming meetings. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thanks.  Now we’ll go to Neil Irwin.   January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

NEIL IRWIN.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  It’s Neil Irwin from Axios.  Glad to be back. Sir, I was wondering if the volatility we’ve seen in financial markets in the last few weeks strikes you as anything alarming or that might affect the trajectory of policy.  Conversely, to the degree that financial conditions have tightened some, might that be desirable in some ways in achieving your, your tightening goals? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, as you know, the ultimate focus that we have is on the real economy:  maximum employment and price stability.  And financial conditions matter to the extent that they have implications for achieving the dual mandate.  And you also know that we, we look at broader financial conditions, not one or two things, one or two markets.  And what we’re always asking ourselves is, are we seeing changes that are both persistent and material enough that—of a change in financial conditions—that they are inconsistent with the achievement of our goals?  So that’s how we’re looking at that.  And I don’t want to comment on today’s financial conditions broadly, but we’re not looking at any one market or, or so.  So that’s how we’re thinking. In terms of what we’ve seen, I would say this.  We, you know, we said at our last meeting we published the Summary of Economic Projections, the median of which—the median participant expected three rate increases this year.  And, you know, it’s six weeks, seven weeks later now.  And you have seen that our communication channel with the markets is working.  participants are expecting a balance sheet runoff to begin, you know, at the appropriate time, sometime later this year perhaps.  We haven’t made that decision yet.  So we, we feel like the communications we have with market participants and with the general public are working and  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL that financial conditions are reflecting in advance the decisions that we make.  And monetary policy works significantly through expectations.  So that, that in and of itself is appropriate. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Howard Schneider. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  You know, for a year or so—Hi.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  So for a year now, the statements referenced the benchmarks for this initial interest rate increase.  Now that we’re approaching that moment, what are the benchmarks going to be for subsequent rate increases?  I know you can’t stipulate the path, but how should we think about the criteria for the next step and the next step? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, you’re right.  We haven’t got—we haven’t gotten to that point yet.  We haven’t made a decision yet, and we’ll make that decision at the March meeting.  We’ll make a decision whether to raise the federal funds rate.  I would say that the Committee is, is of a mind to, to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting, assuming that conditions are appropriate for doing so.  We have—we have our eyes on, on the risks, particularly around the world.  But we do expect some softening in the economy from Omicron, but we think that that should be temporary.  And we think that the economy should—the underlying strength of the economy should, you know, should, should—show through fairly quickly after that. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  If I could follow just on a related question, the December federal funds rate ever getting over the estimate of neutral.  Given developments since then, do you still think that’s a credible narrative for the ultimate path of policy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I think the path is highly uncertain and that we’re committed to using our tools to make sure that inflation, high inflation that we’re seeing, does not become entrenched.  So a number of factors would be—it’s not just monetary policy—a number of  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL factors are supporting a decline in inflation, as I mentioned.  Fiscal policy will be—will provide significantly less of an impulse to growth.  We do expect this year—although we do expect now that it will come slower than, than we had expected and hoped—that there will be relief on the supply side.  So that, too, should—should lower the supply-side barriers, which are a big part of the story of why inflation is high.  In addition, monetary policy will be becoming significantly less accommodative. So the question is—you know, we’ll, we’ll be asking this question all year long, and that will be, are things turning out as we expect?  There’s a case that, for whatever reason, the economy slows more and inflation slows more than expected; we’ll react to that.  If, instead, we see inflation at a higher level or a more persistent level, then we’ll react to that.  And, again, we’re, we’re well aware that this is a different economy than—than existed during the last tightening cycle, and our policy is going to reflect those differences. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Jeanna Smialek.  Let’s go to Jeanna.  [No response]  Okay.  Let’s go to Steve Liesman. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you, Michelle.  And thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I have one sort of technical question and one question on principle.  The technical question is, if, if you’re going to discuss balance sheet at the next upcoming meetings and you won’t begin balance sheet reduction until after you begin rate hikes, it seems to technically mean that you won’t or can’t begin balance sheet reduction until the summer.  Is that correct?  That’s the first thing. Second of all, you suggested that, that the—with balance sheet running in the background—that you would possibly be raising rates and running off the balance sheet at the  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL same time.  That’s sort of the technical question part of it.  The principal question I have is, you said it’s going to be running in the background.  But the statement on the balance sheet principles says “the Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach” based on “economic and financial developments,” which suggests there’s something of a reaction function associated to the balance sheet and it won’t be running in the background.  So can you give us any sense of the discussion or staff presentation on what is the reaction function surrounding the balance sheet?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So let me—let me—let me start by talking about that last paragraph.  So you’ll remember during the last cycle that this process of building up and then shrinking the balance sheet is a complicated one, and it involves, inevitably, surprises.  And so during, during the years, during the prior cycle, we amended our balance sheet principles a number of times.  Now, we didn’t intend to do that.  It just—events required us to do so.  So we got a pretty robust paragraph there that says we’re free to do this at any time.  And it doesn’t mean we’re going to, but if the situation turns out to be different than we had thought, we’re not going to be—we’re not going to stick with something that isn’t working.  That’s all that’s saying.  It’s meant to be quite a general statement rather than a, a hint. So, I mean, I like to think that our, you know, our philosophy of the balance sheet is, is embodied in these principles.  So, you know, the idea that, for example, the federal funds rate is the primary means of adjusting the stance of policy, that we’ll use—determine the timing and pace of reducing the size of the balance sheet to foster the dual mandate, that we’ll begin to reduce the size after we begin the process of raising rates, and on and on like that.  I mean, that—those are all the things that, that try to describe how we will proceed.  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL But maybe at a higher level, to try to get at your question:  You know, asset purchases were, were enormously important at the beginning of the recovery in terms of restoring market function, as they were at—right after the—in the critical phase of the Global Financial Crisis.  And then after [that], they were a macroeconomic tool to support demand.  And now the economy no longer needs this, this highly accommodative policy that we put in place.  So it’s time to stop asset purchases first and then, at the appropriate time, start to shrink the balance sheet.  Now, the balance sheet is, is substantially larger than it needs to be.  We’ve identified the end state as—in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently [and] effectively in the ample-reserves regime.  So there’s a substantial amount of, of shrinkage in the balance sheet to be done.  That’s going to take some time.  We want that process to be orderly and predictable.  And so those are some of the ways that I would think this, this lays out our, you know, the way we—the way we’re thinking about this. In terms of the timing, I can’t really help you.  You know, it just says after, after we get under way.  So we’re—I would say we are, we’re going to have another discussion at, at the next meeting.  And my guess is, we’ll have at least one other discussion at the meeting after that.  And, you know, we’ll, we’ll tell you as we make progress.  And we’ll, you know, we’ll start the process of allowing runoff and shrinking the balance sheet at what we find to be the appropriate time.  It’s—I wish I could say more.  But, honestly, we haven’t made those decisions.  And we actually haven’t even really had the, the important discussions on a lot of the details that we will have at coming meetings. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Craig Torres. 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Chair Powell, Chair Powell.  Good afternoon, Michelle and Chair Powell.  Craig Torres from Bloomberg.  Chair Powell, at the beginning of the conversation, you  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL said risks are two sided.  And I’m wondering if you can elaborate on what are the risks to the elusive soft landing.  Is Fed policy a risk?  Overtightening?  Or what are the risks? And then second, Chair Powell, I have a quick administrative question.  You know, Robert Kaplan’s disclosure of his securities transactions—and in a couple of months, Chair Powell, or maybe sooner, you and I will file our tax returns.  And we’ll list transactions and all kinds of things.  And next to those transactions, we’ll put dates.  And Bloomberg asked for the dates of Mr. Kaplan’s transactions.  The Dallas Fed is not giving us the dates.  And I don’t see why this is a matter for the inspector general or anybody else.  I mean, why can’t he give us the dates?  Will you help us get the dates of those transactions?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So you asked about the risks first.  So I—you know, the one risk is that inflation risks are still to the upside in the views of most FOMC participants and, certainly, in my view as well.  There’s a risk that, that the high inflation we’re seeing will be prolonged, and there’s a risk that it will move even higher.  So we don’t—we don’t think that’s the base case, but you asked what the risks are.  And that’s—we have to be in a position with our monetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes.  And that calls for us to be in position.  We, we have an expectation about the way the economy is going to be evolved, but we’ve got to be in a position to, to address different outcomes, including the one where inflation remains higher. And, of course, that is a risk to the—to the—to the expansion.  You know, we’ve been saying that what we need here is another long expansion, which is the kind of thing we saw over the last [one], which was a record long expansion.  We saw labor force participation rise.  We saw wages persistently higher for people at the lower end, and there, there really was no obvious  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL imbalance in the economy that threatened that expansion.  It could have gone on for years were it not hit by the pandemic. So we’d love to find a way to get back to that.  That’s going to require price stability, and that’s going to require the Fed to tighten interest rate policy and do our part in getting inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. So I mentioned two-sided risks.  You know, a couple things.  One, Omi—COVID is not over.  And COVID can continue to evolve, and it’s just—we have to accept that it’s not over, and the risks to it can slow down growth.  And that would be—that’s sort of a downside risk from a growth standpoint.  I would point to—you know, another, another risk is just further, further problems in the supply chains, which could slow down activity.  And you see the situation in China as a situation there where that’s—their no-COVID policy may cause more lockdowns, is likely to, and that may play into—may play into more problems in supply chains.  In addition, there’s what’s going on in Eastern Europe and things like that.  So there’s plenty of risk out there.  And we, you know, we can’t—we can’t forget that there are risks on both sides.  So that’s, that’s there.  That’s what I would say. I know you’ve been all over this issue with, with my colleagues, Craig, on the issue of, of information.  We don’t—we don’t have that information at the Board.  And, you know, I hand—I asked the inspector general to do an investigation, and that is out of my hands.  I play no role in it.  I seek to play no role in it.  And I don’t—I really—I can’t help you here today on this issue.  And I’m sorry I can’t. 

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Okay, okay.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ll go to Jeanna now.  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.  And sorry for my tech issues.  I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about where your thinking on inflation stands today.  You know, the last time we saw an SEP back in September, we saw that you and your colleagues were projecting that inflation would sort of sink back down quite close to target by the end of the year.  And I wonder if you still think that projection from December is a reasonable one.  And if your thinking has changed at all, I wonder how you’re thinking about that.  And I also wonder if you could talk a little bit about the pathway to getting to that at the end of the year? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I’d say, you know, since, since the December meeting, I would say that the inflation situation is about the same but probably slightly worse.  I’d be inclined to raise my own estimate of 2022 core PCE inflation—let’s just go with that—by a few tenths today.  But we’re not writing, writing down an SEP at this meeting.  But I think it’s—it hasn’t gotten better.  It’s probably gotten just a—just a bit worse, and that’s been the pattern.  That’s been the pattern. So I think if you look at the—the FOMC participants are—there’s a range there.  And that range has been moving to the right for, for a year now.  And, by the way, if you look at other forecasters, essentially all other macro forecasters who do this for a living, you’ve seen the same pattern.  So, what do we think about that?  Well, I think we, you know, we wrote down rate increases in the December meetings, each of us individually.  And I think to the extent the situation deteriorates further, our policy will have to address that, if it deteriorates meaningfully further, either in the time dimension or in the size of the inflation dimension.  So that’s how we’re thinking about it.  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL I—as I mentioned, though, I think it’s—part of this will be that us, the Fed, moving away from a very highly accommodative policy to a substantially less accommodative policy and then, over time, to a policy that’s not accommodative, in time.  I don’t know when that will be.  That’s—those are the things that we’re—that we’re thinking about.  That’s, that’s part of it.  Another part of it is that fiscal policy provided an impulse to growth over the last two years.  That impulse will be less, in fact, will be—will be negative this year.  And so that’s another thing.  The other one is, we will eventually get relief on the supply side.  And, you know, the ports will be cleared up.  And there will be semiconductors and things like that.  Now, what we’re learning is, it’s just taking much longer, so I think—longer than expected.  And that, I think, does raise, raise the risk that high inflation will be more persistent.  I do think we’ll come off of the highs that we saw in the early part of this episode in the—in the spring last year.  But, really, what’s—the question is going to be, what is inflation running at?  And so we’ll be watching that. And I, you know, we—our objective is to get inflation back down to 2 percent.  It’s also to provide enough support to keep the labor market healthy.  The labor market is very, very strong right now, and I think that that strength will continue.  There’s a—there’s really a shortage of workers.  We see it particularly among production and nonsupervisory workers and people in the lowest quartile.  You see very large wage increases.  I mentioned some of the other indicators.  So I think that’s, that’s what we’re looking at.  And we’re also—you know, we realize, I think, as everyone does, that this outlook is quite uncertain and that we’re going to have to adapt.  And we’re going to communicate as clearly as we can.  But we’re going to have to be adaptable and, you know, move, move as appropriate. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Great.  Thank you.   January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Colby Smith. 

[SECTION]

COLBY SMITH.  Thank you, Michelle.  Chair Powell, when you talk about being humble and nimble about the path forward for monetary policy, does that also include the possibility of raising interest rates by larger increments and, say, doing a 50 basis point hike at some point if inflation does not moderate sufficiently?  And should we interpret this approach as a departure from the gradual pace that we saw during the last hiking cycle? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, as I mentioned, we have not made these decisions.  We really haven’t.  And, and what I can tell you now, though, is that we fully appreciate that this is a different situation.  If you look back to where we were in 2015, ’16, ’17, ’18 when we were raising rates, inflation was very close to 2 percent, even below 2 percent.  Unemployment was, was not at our estimates of the natural rate.  And growth was, you know, in the 2 to 3 percent range. Right now, we have inflation running substantially above 2 percent and, and, you know, more persistently than we would like.  We have growth—even in forecasts, even in the somewhat reduced forecast for 2022—we still see growth higher than, substantially higher than what we estimate to be the potential growth rate.  And we see a labor market where, by so many measures, it is historically tight.  I think the—you know, in a way, the least tight aspect of it is, is looking at the unemployment rate, which is still below our median estimate of, of [the unemployment rate consistent with] maximum employment.  If you look at things like quits and job openings, as I mentioned earlier, and wages, you’re seeing—and, and just the ratio of job openings to unemployed—you’re seeing a very, very tight labor market. Now, we also know that labor force participation is significantly lower.  It’s 1½ percentage points lower than it was in February of 2020.  Maybe a [full] percentage point of  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL that is, is retirements.  Some part of those retirements are, are, you know, related to COVID rather than just regular retirements.  So we think there’s, there’s a pool of people out there who could come back into the labor force.  But it’s not happening very quickly, and it may not—it that’s how we think about that.  We haven’t made—to your specific question—we really have not addressed those questions.  And we’ll begin to address them as we—as we move into the 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Rachel. 

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Thank you, Michelle.  And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions.  I’m wondering if you can talk to us about any metrics that the Fed uses to assess how inflation affects different groups of Americans, especially lower-, lower-income earners?  And are you worried that the Fed underestimates, or can’t effectively measure, the impact of inflation on some of the most vulnerable households?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So it’s, it’s more a matter of—I think the problem that we’re—that we’re talking about here is really that people who are on fixed incomes who are living paycheck to paycheck, they’re spending most or all of their—of, of what they’re earning on food, gasoline, rent, heating their—heating, things like that, basic necessities.  And so inflation right away, right away forces people like that to make very difficult decisions.  So that’s really the point.  I don’t—I’m not aware of, you know, inflation literally falling more on, on different socioeconomic groups.  It’s—that’s not the point.  The point is, some people are just really in a—prone to suffer more. I mean, for people who are economically well off, inflation isn’t good.  It’s bad.  High inflation is, is bad, but they’re going to be able to continue to eat and keep their homes and drive  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL their cars and things like that.  It’s more—so that, that’s really how I think of it.  And, you know, we, we have to control inflation for the benefit of all Americans.  But part of—part of it is just that it’s particularly hard on people with fixed incomes and low incomes who spent most of their—of their income on necessities, which are—which are experiencing high inflation now. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Edward Lawrence. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thanks, Michelle, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question here.  So year over year, inflation’s at a 40-year high.  The [increase in] input costs for producer price index for all of 2021 was the highest on record.  Some investors fear that the Fed might be moving too late.  Now, you said no decisions were made on the path of rate hikes, but was a rate hike more than 25 basis points discussed today? And as a follow to that—because I have problems with the mute button—as a follow to that, you testified that the supply chain issues could be worked out by the end of the year.  You talked about that today.  The CEO of Ford, though, told Fox Business today that the chip shortage will last into 2023.  So today you said inflation will start to ease this year.  I want to drill down and get a timeline that you see as to when we could see that relief.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I, I would not say that I would expect the supply chain issues to be completely worked out by the end of this year.  I do not expect them, and I have not expected them.  What I would say, and I have been saying, is that I expect progress to be made in the second half of this year, mainly—progress because we’re not making much progress.  If you look at a ton of metrics, you can find some that suggest that delivery times are shorter and inventories in some industries moving up.  But, overall, we’re not—we’re not making progress.  And, you know, things like the semiconductor issue are going to—they’re going to be quite a long time.  I would think they’ll go more than through 2023.  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL In terms of—so in terms of being too late, I would just say this.  We—our policy needs to be positioned to address the full range of plausible outcomes, as I said, and particularly the possibility that inflation will continue to run higher, more persistently than we’d expected.  And we think we are positioned to make the changes in our policy to do that, and, and we’re committed to doing that.  And that’s, that’s really where we are. In terms of your, your question about the, the size of rate increases, we haven’t—we haven’t faced those decisions.  We haven’t made them.  It isn’t possible to sit down here today and tell you with any confidence what the—what the precise path will be.  But in—as we work our way through this, meeting by meeting, we are aware that this is a very different, different expansion, as I’ve said a couple times, with higher inflation, higher growth, a much stronger economy.  And I think those differences are likely to be reflected in—in the policy that we implement.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Mike McKee. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’d like to sort of weave some of the strands of your answers together and ask you, as you start to reverse policy, what your goal is. Are you going to be raising interest rates until you get inflation to 2 percent?  Do you want to go below 2 percent so that, on average, you get a 2 percent inflation rate?  And because you said we have to protect the employment part of your mandate, is there some sort of circuit breaker that would stop you from raising interest rates on the employment side? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, no.  There’s no—there’s nothing in our framework about having inflation run below 2 percent so that we would do that, try to achieve that outcome.  So the answer to that is, is “no.”  What we’re trying to do is get inflation, keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.  That’s, that’s always the, the ultimate goal.  And we do that in the  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL service of having inflation—we get to that goal by having inflation average 2 percent over time.  And if inflation doesn’t average 2 percent over time, then it’s not clear why inflation expectations would be anchored at 2 percent.  So that, that’s the way we think about that.  You know, it—what was the last part of your—of your question? 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  I was asking if you’re protecting the employment side of the mandate, whether there’s some sort of circuit breaker there. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Nothing like that.  I mean, I would say you have a tremendously strong labor market.  And you have growth this year at—forecast to be well above—well above potential.  I mean, people who are forecasting growth think potential growth is around 2 [percent].  Most forecasts [of actual growth] are significantly above that for 2022, and that’s even with, with policy becoming substantially less accommodative.  So the labor market’s going to be strong for some time. We’re—ideally, what we’re trying to achieve is inflation getting back down to 2 percent.  And we’re trying to do that in a process that, that, that accomplishes—you know, that will also leave the labor market in a very strong position.  And no one really knows what that will take.  Again, I would say that it isn’t just monetary policy that’s helping inflation get down.  It’ll be supply-side improvements, and it’ll be less, less fiscal, you know, less fiscal impulse in all likelihood. So—but monetary policy will do our job.  It is our job to get inflation down to 2 percent.  And a situation where, where the two goals are—the two goals can be in tension is a difficult one.  But I—but I don’t really think they are here, though, because I think a really significant threat to further strengthening in the labor market in the form of higher participation over time is high inflation.  And also, high inflation is taking away the benefits of some of these larger wage  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL increases that we’re seeing now.  So we do hope to achieve, and our plan is to achieve, both of those goals. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  If I could—if I could follow up, does the danger of tightening too much as policy works its way into the economy with a lag mean that you should go back to being more forecast dependent in making decisions, rather than the state dependency you’ve been using as a framework for the last year and a half or so? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  State dependency was particularly around the thought that if we—if we saw a very strong labor market, we would wait to see actual inflation—actual inflation before we tightened.  And so that was a very state-dependent thought because, for a long time, we’d been tightening on the expectation of high inflation, which never appeared.  And that was the case for, for a number of years.  So in this particular situation, we will be clearly monitoring incoming data as well as the evolving outlook. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Michael Derby. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Thank you for taking my question.  I want to ask you, with the benefit of hindsight, and I realize, I mean, that is what it is.  But do you feel that, you know, monetary policy and fiscal policy maybe did too much to react to the crisis and that part of the inflation problem that we’re having right now is because the government response, you know, collectively was more than what the economy ended up needing? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I think it’s too soon to write that history, really.  But what I would say is this.  The—if you remember what it felt like at the beginning of the pandemic, literally the global economy shutting down in large part, including our own economy, and people going to their homes for weeks on end in masks, and there are no vaccines, and it could be a really long  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL time to get them, you know.  And then, you know, you have—economic activity drops by a shocking amount in one—so there was a real risk of lasting damage. And I think Congress responded remarkably with the—with the CARES Act, incredibly timely and very powerful.  People will—there’ll always be flaws in these things.  But in real time, it was a remarkable achievement.  And we responded.  And what we were able to do was, you know, stave off a collapse of the financial system at the beginning and make time for what really needed to happen, which was the income replacement and then the recovery that Congress enabled with the CARES Act. So now, that was a lot of—that was a lot.  And what we did was a lot.  And, you know, now—so, what we have now is, we have the strongest recovery of any, any country.  And we have—we have a recovery that looks completely unlike other recoveries that we’ve had, because we’ve, we’ve put so much support behind the recovery.  And we’re managing the, the relatively high-class problems that come with that, which are high inflation and a labor shortage.  So—and these are serious problems, very serious problems that we, you know, we’re working as hard as we can on. Was it too much?  Again, I’m going to leave that to the historians.  And—but look, in 25 years, we’ll look back at this incident, which will be a, you know, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-year period.  And we’ll say, you know, we’ll have a—we’ll have a much better basis to make a judgment about the actions that people took.  But it was all founded, though, in a—in a very strong reaction to a, you know, to a unique historical event.  And I guess I’ll have to leave it at that.  I look for—I hope I’ll be around to see how that looks in 25 years. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY.  Fair enough.  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Jean Yung.  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

JEAN YUNG.  Thanks, Michelle.  Chair Powell, some investors are expecting the yield curve could flatten, or even invert, after rate hikes begin.  Would that worry you, and how important is that risk in the Fed’s consideration for adjusting policy? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we, we do monitor the slope of the yield curve, but we don’t control the slope of the yield curve.  Many flat—many factors influence longer-term interest rates.  But it is something that we watch, and, and you will know that from when we had this issue a few years ago.  And we take it into account, along with many other financial conditions, as we try to assess the implications of all those conditions for the economic outlook.  So that’s, that’s one thing I would say. Another is, currently, you’ve got a slope.  If you think about 2s to 10s, 2-year Treasury to 10-year Treasury, I think that’s around 75 basis points.  That’s well within the range of a normal—of a normal yield-curve slope.  So it’s something we’re monitoring.  We don’t think of it as—I don’t think of it as some kind of an iron law.  But we do look at it and try to understand the implications and what it’s telling us.  And it’s—but it’s one of many things that we monitor.  

[SECTION]

JEAN YUNG.  Can I follow up real quick and ask, if it—if it did invert, would you tie it to U.S. fundamentals?  Or would it be driven by a much broader set of factors? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We’d—that’s, that’s a good question in, in real time.  Obviously, U.S. long-term sovereign debt is an—is an important global asset.  And it—and the fact that our rates are so much higher than, than other risk-free sovereign rates around the world may put something of a ceiling on our—on our rates.  I don’t know.  But it would really depend on the—on the facts and circumstances at that time. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let’s go to Brian Cheung for the last question.  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance.  Within the context of just the broad effort to normalize rates, would you describe what you want to do as a gradual hiking?  And then, secondly, within the context of hiking cycles, it’s often the talking point for financial stability and wanting to make sure that asset bubbles don’t emerge.  Is that something that has also factored into the conversation as you start to think about hiking rates?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I would describe what we’re doing along these lines.  This is going to be a year in which we move steadily away from the very highly accommodative monetary policy that we put in place to deal with the—with the economic effects of the pandemic.  And that’s going to involve a number of things.  It’s going to involve and does involve finishing asset purchases.  It’s going to involve lifting off.  And it’s going to involve additional rate increases as appropriate.  And we, we have—we’re going to write down in March our next assessment of what that might be.  It’s going to continue to evolve as the data evolve.  We need to be quite adaptable, I think, in our understanding of this. The last thing we’re going to do is, we’re going to have a couple more meetings, I think, to talk about allowing the balance sheet to begin to run off and [to] do so in a predictable manner.  And that’s, that’s something that we will also be doing as appropriate.  And I wouldn’t—I don’t think it’s possible to say exactly how this is going to go.  And we’re, we’re going to need to be, as I’ve mentioned, nimble about this. And the economy is quite different this time.  I’ve said this several times now.  The economy is quite different.  It’s stronger.  Inflation is higher.  The labor market is much, much stronger than it was.  And growth is above trend, even this year, let alone last year.  So all of those things are going to go into our thinking as we make—as we make monetary policy.  And  January 26, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL you asked about financial stability concerns.  In connection with our policy–was that your question? 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Yes.  Within the context of other hiking cycles, it seems like [a set of] worries about asset bubbles emerging as a result of easy rates has been part of that .  I didn’t know if that was part of the discussion today. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I would just say this.  We, we, of course, have a financial stability framework.  And what it shows is a number of, of positive aspects of financial stability.  But you mentioned, really, [the behavior of] asset prices is one of the four.  So asset prices are somewhat elevated, and they reflect a high risk appetite and that sort of thing.  I don’t really think asset prices themselves represent a significant threat to financial stability, and that’s because households are in good shape financially than they have been.  Businesses are in good shape financially.  Defaults on business loans are low and that kind of thing.  The banks are highly capitalized with high liquidity and quite resilient and strong.  There are some concerns in the—in the nonbank financial sector around—still around money market funds, although the SEC is making—has made some very positive proposals there.  And we also saw some things in the Treasury market during the acute phase of the crisis, which, which we’re looking at ways to address.  But, overall, the financial stability vulnerabilities are manageable—are manageable, I would say.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you very much.  ",other,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
50,2022-05-04,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  It’s nice to see everyone in person for the first time in a couple years. directly to the American people. Before I go into the details of today’s meeting, I’d like to take this opportunity to speak Inflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing, and we’re moving expeditiously to bring it back down.  We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.  The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two years and have proved resilient.  It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. From the standpoint of our Congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see:  The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high.  Against this backdrop, today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ½ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target rate for the federal funds rate will be appropriate.  In addition, we are beginning the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.  I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. After expanding at a robust 5½ percent pace last year, overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter.  Underlying momentum remains strong, however, as the decline largely reflected swings in inventories and net exports—two volatile categories whose movements last quarter likely carry little signal for future growth.  Indeed, household spending and business fixed investment continued to expand briskly.  May 4, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL The labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight.  Over the first three months of the year, employment rose by nearly 1.7 million jobs.  In March, the unemployment rate hit a post-pandemic, and near-five-decade, low of 3.6 percent.  Improvements in labor distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics.  Labor demand is very strong, and, while labor force participation has increased somewhat, labor supply remains subdued.  Employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at the fastest pace in many years. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.  Over the 12 months ending in March, total PCE prices rose 6.6 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5.2 percent.  Aggregate demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond.  Disruptions to supply have been larger, and longer lasting, than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broader range of goods and services.  The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is creating additional upward pressure on inflation.  And COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to further exacerbate supply chain disruptions as well. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is causing tremendous loss and hardship, and our thoughts and sympathies are with the people of Ukraine.  Our job is to consider the implications for the U.S. economy, which remain highly uncertain.  In addition to the effects on inflation, the invasion and related events are likely to restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, creating spillovers to the U.S. economy through trade and other channels.  May 4, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to restoring price stability. Against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting, and it will continue to do so.  At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point and stated that it “anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.”  We also decided to begin the process of reducing the size of our balance sheet, which will play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy.  We are on a path to move our policy rate expeditiously to more normal levels.  Assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in line with expectations, there is a broad sense on the Committee that additional 50-basis-point increases should be on the table at the next couple of meetings.  We will make our decisions meeting by meeting as we learn from incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.  And we will continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.  Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. With regard to our balance sheet, we also issued our specific plans for reducing our securities holdings.  Consistent with the principles we issued in January, we intend to significantly reduce the size of our balance sheet over time in a predictable manner by allowing the principal payments from our securities holdings to roll off the balance sheet, up to monthly cap amounts.  For Treasury securities, the cap will be $30 billion per month for three months and  May 4, 2022  will then increase to $60 billion per month.  The decline in holdings of Treasury securities under   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   this monthly cap will include Treasury coupon securities and, to the extent that coupon securities are less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills.  For agency mortgage-backed securities, the cap will be $17.5 billion per month for three months and will then increase to $35 billion per month.  At the current level of mortgage rates, the actual pace of agency MBS runoff would likely be less than this monthly cap amount.  Our balance sheet decisions are guided by our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  And, in that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of the details of our approach in light of economic and financial developments. Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways.  Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store.  We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.  And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty to what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time.  We are highly attentive to inflation risks.  The Committee is determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability.  The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy. To conclude:  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, the unemployment rate at 3.6 percent in March is now essentially at the level that the Committee had expected would prevail over the next three years and at the bottom end of FOMC participants’  May 4, 2022  projections for the longer-run rate that you submitted in the projections at the last meeting.  How   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   has your outlook for further declines in the unemployment rate changed since March?  What does this imply for your inflation forecast?  And how has your level of confidence changed with regard to the feasibility of slowing hiring without pushing the economy into recession?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  So you’re right—3.6 percent unemployment is just about as low as it’s been in 50 years.  And I would say that I expect, and Committee members generally expect, that we’ll get some additional participation.  So people will be coming back into the labor force.  We’ve seen that particularly among prime-age people.  And that will, of course, tend to hold the unemployment rate up a little bit.  I would also expect, though, that job creation will slow.  Job creation has been, you know, more than half a million per month in recent months—very, very strong, particularly for this stage of the economy.  And so we think—with fiscal policy less supportive, with monetary policy less supportive, we think that job creation will slow as well.  So it is certainly possible that the unemployment would go down further.  But so I would expect those to be relatively limited because of the additional supply and also just the slowing in job creation. Implications for inflation—really, the wages matter a fair amount for companies, particularly in the service sector.  Wages are running high, the highest they’ve run in quite some time.  And they are one good example, or good illustration, really, of how tight the labor market really is, the fact that wages are running at the highest level in many decades.  And that’s because of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market.  So we think through our policies—through further healing in the labor market, higher rates, for example, of vacancy filling and things like that, and more people coming back in—we’d like to think that supply and demand will come back into balance and that, therefore, wage inflation will moderate to still  May 4, 2022  high levels of wage increases, but ones that are more consistent with 2 percent inflation.  That’s   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   our expectation.  Your third question was? the economy into a downturn. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Your level of confidence that you can slow hiring without pushing 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess I would say it this way:  There’s a path.  There’s a path by which we would be able to have demand moderate in the labor market and therefore have vacancies come down without unemployment going up, because vacancies are at such an extraordinarily high level.  There’re 1.9 vacancies for every unemployed person, 11.5 million vacancies, 6 million unemployed people.  So we haven’t been in that place on the vacancy, sort of the vacancy/unemployed curve, the Beveridge curve.  We haven’t been at that sort of level of a ratio in the modern era.  So, in principle, it seems as though by moderating demand, we could see vacancies come down and, as a result—and they could come down fairly significantly and, I think, put supply and demand at least closer together than they are.  And that would give us a chance to get inflation down, get wages down, and then get inflation down without having to slow the economy and have a recession and have unemployment rise materially.  So there’s a path to that. Now, I would say, I think we have a good chance to have a soft or softish landing or outcome, if you will.  And I’ll give you a couple of reasons for that.  One is, households and businesses are in very strong financial shape.  You’re looking at, you know, excess savings on balance sheets—excess in the sense that they’re substantially larger than the prior trend.  Businesses are in good financial shape.  The labor market is, as I mentioned, very, very strong.  And so it doesn’t seem to be anywhere close to a downturn.  Therefore, the economy is strong and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.  So, but I’ll say, I do expect that this  May 4, 2022  will be very challenging; it’s not going to be easy.  And it may well depend, of course, on events   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   that are not under our control.  But our job is to use our tools to try to achieve that outcome, and that’s what we’re going to do.

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman.  You talked about using 50-basis-point rate hikes or the possibility of them in coming meetings.  Might there be something larger than 50?  Is 75 or a percentage point possible?  And perhaps you could walk us through your calibration.  Why one month should—or one meeting should we expect a 50?  Why something bigger?  Why something smaller?  What is the reasoning for the level of the amount of tightening?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So a 75-basis-point increase is not something the Committee is actively considering.  What we are doing is, we raised [the funds rate by] 50 basis points today.  And we’ve said that, again, assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in ways that are consistent with our expectations, there’s a broad sense on the Committee that additional 50-basis-point increases should be on the table for the next couple of meetings.  So we’re going to make those decisions at the meetings, of course, and we’ll be paying close attention to the incoming data and the evolving outlook as well as to financial conditions.  And, finally, of course, we will be communicating to the public about what our expectations will be as they So the test is really just as I laid it out—economic and financial conditions evolving broadly in line with expectations.  And, you know, I think expectations are that we’ll start to see inflation, you know, flattening out—and not necessarily declining yet, but we’ll see more evidence.  We’ve seen some evidence that core PCE inflation is perhaps either reaching a peak evolve.  May 4, 2022  or flattening out.  We’ll want to know more than just some evidence.  We’ll want to really feel   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL like we’re making some progress there.  And we’re going to make these decisions, and there’ll be a lot more information.  I just think we want to see that information as we get there.  It’s a very difficult environment to try to give forward guidance 60, 90 days in advance.  There are just so many things that can happen in the economy and around the world.  So, you know, we’re leaving ourselves room to look at the data and make a decision as we get there. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  I’m sorry, but if inflation is lower one month and the unemployment rate higher, would that be something that we would calibrate toward a lower increase in the funds rate? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I don’t think the one month is—no.  No.  One month’s reading doesn’t tell us much.  You know, we‘d want to see evidence that inflation is moving in a direction that gives us more comfort.  As I said, we’ve got two months now where core inflation is a little lower, but we’re not looking at that as a reason to take some comfort.  You know, I think we need to really see that our expectation is being fulfilled—that inflation, in fact, is under control and starting to come down.  But, again, it’s not like we would stop.  We would just go back to 25-basis-point increases.  It’ll be a judgment call when these meetings arrive.  But, again, our expectation is, if we see what we expect to see, then we would have 50-basis-point increases on the table at the next two meetings. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Let’s go to Colby. 

[SECTION]

COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Colby Smith from the Financial Times.  Given the expectation that inflation will remain well above the Fed’s target at year-end, what constitutes a neutral policy setting in terms of the fed funds rate?  And to what extent is it appropriate for policy to move beyond that level at some point this year?   May 4, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So—neutral.  When we talk about the neutral rate, we’re really talking about the rate that neither pushes economic activity higher nor slows it down.  So it’s a concept, really.  It’s not something we can identify with any precision.  So we estimate it within broad bands of uncertainty.  And the current estimates on the Committee are sort of 2 to 3 percent.  And also, that’s a longer-run estimate.  That’s an estimate for an economy that’s at full employment and 2 percent inflation.  So, really, what we’re doing is, we’re raising rates expeditiously to what we see as the broad range of plausible levels of neutral.  But we know that there’s not a bright line drawn on the road that tells us when we get there.  So we’re going to be looking at financial conditions, right?  Our policy affects financial conditions, and financial conditions affect the economy.  So we’re going to be looking at the effect of our policy moves on financial conditions.  Are they tightening appropriately?  And then we’re going to be looking at the effects on the economy.  And we’re going to be making a judgment about whether we’ve done enough to get us on a path to restore price stability.  It’s that.  So if that path happens to involve levels that are higher than estimates of neutral, then we will not hesitate to go to those levels.  We won’t. But, again, there’s a sort of false precision in the discussion that we as policymakers don’t really feel.  You know, you’re going to raise rates, and you’re going to be kind of inquiring how that is affecting the economy through financial conditions.  And, of course, if higher rates are required, then we won’t hesitate to deliver them.

NEIL IRWIN.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin with Axios.  Do you see evidence that inflationary psychology is changing in areas like workers’ wage demands, businesses’  May 4, 2022  willingness to raise prices?  Do you see evidence that there is a psychological shift going on on   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL inflation?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We don’t really see strong evidence of that yet, but that does not in any way make us comfortable.  I think if you look at short-term inflation expectations, they’re quite elevated.  And you can look at that and say, “Well, that’s because people expect inflation to come down.”  And, in fact, inflation expectations [at longer horizons] come down fairly sharply.  Longer-term inflation expectations have been reasonably stable but have moved up to—but only to levels where they were in 2014, by some measures.  So you can look at that.  And I think that’s a fair description of the picture.  But it’s really about the risks.  We don’t see a wage–price spiral.  We see that companies have the ability to raise prices, and they’re doing that, but there have been price shocks.  So I just think it takes you back to the basic point—was that we know we need to expeditiously move our policy rate up to ranges of more normal, neutral levels.  And we need to look around and keep going if we don’t see that financial conditions have tightened adequately or that the economy is behaving in ways that suggest that we’re not where we need to be.  So, again, you don’t see those things yet, but I would say there’s no basis for feeling comfortable about that.  It’s a risk that we simply can’t run.  We can’t allow a wage–price spiral to happen.  And we can’t allow inflation expectations to become unanchored.  It’s just something that we can’t allow to happen, and so we’ll look at it that way. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Great.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.  You mentioned in the statement both the upside risks to inflation from Russia and China.  Obviously, those are very much supply shocks rather than demand side.  And I wonder what you meant to convey by adding them—I wonder what you meant to convey by adding those.  May 4, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well.  So our tools don’t really work on supply shocks.  Our tools work on demand.  And to the extent we can’t affect, really, oil prices or other commodity prices or food prices and things like that, so we can’t affect those.  But there’s a job to do on demand.  And that—you can see that in the labor market, where demand is substantially in excess of supply of workers.  And you can see it in the product markets as well.  But I guess I’m just pointing out that—a couple of things.  For both the situation in Ukraine and the situation in China, they’re likely to, both, add to headline inflation.  And people are going to be suffering from that, you know.  People almost suffer more from food and energy shocks then, but—even though they don’t actually tell us much about the future path.  So the second thing is that they’re both capable of preventing further progress in supply chains healing or even making supply chains temporarily worse.  So they’re going to weigh on the process of global supply chain healing, which is going to affect broader inflation, too.  So, in a way, they’re two further negative shocks that have hit really in the last, you know, 60 days, 90 days. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida from Politico.  I want to follow up on that, because you all have obviously highlighted that there are both supply and demand issues at play in inflation.  And I’m just wondering, you know, if these supply chain issues continue because of Russia, because of China, or just because these things take a while to work out, does getting back down to your 2 percent mandate require that the supply chain issues get resolved, since you can only handle the demand side, as you said?  Or will you have to crimp demand maybe even further if the supply chain issues don’t resolve themselves, in order to try and get inflation back down to where you want it to be?  May 4, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, I’ll just say:  For now, we’re focused on doing the job we need to do on demand, and there’s plenty to be done there.  Again, if you look at it, it’s essentially almost two to one, job vacancies to unemployed people.  There’s a lot of excess demand.  There’re more than 5 million more employed plus job openings than there are the size of the labor force.  So there’s an imbalance there that we have to do our work on.  A very difficult situation—you know, you would look at core inflation, which wouldn’t include the commodity price shocks. And, you know, that’s one of the reasons we would tend to focus on that, because we can have more of an effect on that, but it would be a very difficult situation.  I mean, we have to be sure that inflation expectations remain anchored.  And I mean, that’s part of our job, too, so we’d be watching that carefully.  And it puts any central bank in a very difficult situation.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  And thanks, and nice to be back.  So two questions.  One quick one.  You’ve cited the 1.9 to 1 figure so often now, I’ve got to ask you, what would be a good figure there?  What would you like to see that come down to to think that you’re in sort of a noninflationary vacancy-to-unemployed rate?  And, secondly, on help from inflation, how much are you counting on wealth effects through stock market channels?   Equity markets broadly down quite a bit since late fall, first of the year—how are you mapping that into household consumption?  Have they come down enough?  Do you need another leg down in equity values to think that households are going to stop spending at the rate we need them to stop spending? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Okay, so in terms of the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio, we don’t have a goal in mind.  There’s no specific number that we’re saying, “We’ve got to get to that.”   May 4, 2022  It’s really, you’ve got to get to a place where the labor market appears to be more in balance.    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL And that depends not only on the level of those things—it also, it depends on how well the matching functions in the labor markets are working.  Because, you know, the longer these expansions go on, you can get very efficient with all of that, and the Beveridge curve shifts out.  And that also tends to, you know, to help.  So there isn’t a specific number.  I will say we were—you know, I think, I think when we got to one-to-one in the, you know, in the late teens, we thought that was a pretty good number.  But, again, we’re not shooting for any particular number.  What we’d like to see is progress, but we’re not really looking at that. That’s an intermediate variable.  We’re looking at wages, and we’re looking at, ultimately, inflation.  So, you know, there are a bunch of channels through which policy works.  You can think of it as, you know, interest-sensitive spending, and then you can think of another big one as asset values broadly.  And, you know, there’re big models with, you know, a lot of different channels that are related to that.  You know, we don’t focus on any one market—the equity market or the housing as you suggest, for going up or down or taking a view on whether it’s at a good level or a bad level.  We just would be looking at very broad measures of financial conditions—all the different financial conditions indexes, for example, which include equity.  But they also include debt and other, many other things—credit spreads, things like that—too. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel. 

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel here from the Washington Post.  To follow up from your message from the very beginning, what is your message to the American people about when they will start to feel the effects of, say, a 50-basis-point rate hike or multiple  May 4, 2022  hikes?  How do you explain to them what that does to their grocery bill or their rent or their gas   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   bill?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, first, the first thing to say is that we understand.  And some of us are old enough to have lived through high inflation, and many aren’t.  But it’s very unpleasant.  It’s just something people don’t—when they experience it for the first time, you’re paying more for the same thing.  If you’re a normal economic person, then you probably don’t have that much extra to spend.  And it’s immediately hitting your spending on groceries, on, you know, on gasoline, on energy, and things like that.  So we understand the pain involved.  So how do you get out of that?  And it’s our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant, high nature doesn’t get entrenched in the economy.  That’s what we’re here for, one of the main things we’re here for—perhaps the most fundamental thing we’re here for.  And the way we do that is, we try to get supply and demand back in sync with each other, back in balance, so that the economy is under less stress and inflation will go down.  Now, the process of getting there involves higher rates—so higher mortgage rates, higher borrowing rates, and things like that.  So it’s not going to be pleasant either.  But in the end, everyone is better off.  Everyone— particularly people on fixed incomes and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices.  And so we need to do everything we can to restore stable prices.  We’ll do it as quickly and effectively as we can.  We think we have a good chance to do it without a significant increase in unemployment or, you know, a really sharp slowdown.  But, ultimately, we think about the medium and longer term, and everyone will be better off if we can get this job done—the sooner, the better.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Edward. May 4, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Edward Lawrence with the Fox Business Network.  So you’ve talked in the past about consumer spending and how that drives the economy.  Are you concerned, with this high level of inflation, that the consumer will stop spending—and what’s the level of your concern—pushing us into a recession? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So the economy is doing fairly well.  We expect growth to be solid this year.  And we see, you know, household spending and business investment as fairly strong—and even in the first quarter, which was relatively slow on some other fronts.  So, and the labor lots of job opportunities for—wages are moving up and at rates that haven’t been seen in quite a long time.  So it’s a good time to be a worker looking to, you know, either change jobs or get a wage increase in your current job.  So it’s a strong economy, and nothing about it suggests that it’s close to, or vulnerable to, a recession.  Now, of course, given events around the world and fading fiscal policy effects and higher rates, you could see some slower economic activity.  Certainly, it will not be—last year was an extraordinarily strong growth year as we recovered from the pandemic.  As I mentioned, growth [was] over 5 percent.  But most forecasters have growth this year at, you know, at a solid pace above 2 percent. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  But we’ve talked with economists who have advised Democrats and Republican Presidents who both said that the Fed is so far behind the curve on inflation that a recession is inevitable. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, and as I said, I think we have a good chance to restore price stability without a recession—without, you know, a severe downturn; without materially high, higher unemployment.  And I mentioned the reasons for that.  So I see a strong economy now.  I see a very strong labor market, for example.  Businesses can’t find the people to hire—they can’t  May 4, 2022  find them.  So, typically, in a recession, you would have unemployment.  Now you have surplus   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   demand.  So there should be room, in principle, to reduce that surplus demand without putting people out of work.  The issue will come that we don’t have precision surgical tools.  We have, essentially, interest rates, the balance sheet, and forward guidance, and they’re famously blunt tools.  They’re not capable of surgical precision.  So I would agree.  No one thinks this will be easy, no one thinks it’s straightforward, but there is certainly a plausible path to this, and I do think we’ve got a good chance to do that.  And, you know, our job is not to rate the chances—it is to try to achieve it.  So that’s what we’re doing.  There are a range of opinions, though, and that’s only appropriate. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve Dorsey. 

[SECTION]

STEVE DORSEY.  Thanks.  Steve Dorsey, CBS.  You mentioned earlier, just now, fading fiscal policy.  Do you feel that the Fed has been supported enough from policies at the White House and in Congress in combating inflation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. You know, it’s really the Fed that has responsibility for price stability.  And we take whatever arrives at the Fed in terms of fiscal activity, we take it as a given, and we don’t evaluate it—it’s not our job, really.  We don’t have an oversight function there.  And we look at it as our job, given all the factors that are happening, to try to sustain maximum employment and price stability.  So if Congress or the Administration has ways to help with inflation, I would encourage that, but I’m not going to get into making recommendations or anything like that.  It’s not, it’s really not our role—we need to stay in our lane and do our job.  When we get inflation back under control, then maybe I can, you know, give other people advice [laughter].  Right now, we need to focus on, just focus on doing our job.  And I’ll stick to that.  Stick in our lane.  May 4, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve Matthews. 

[SECTION]

STEVE MATTHEWS.  Steve Matthews with Bloomberg News.  A number of your colleagues have said that the rates will need to go above neutral into a restrictive territory to bring down inflation.  One, do you agree with that?  And, two, you’ve recently spoken in great praise of Paul Volcker, who had the courage to bring inflation down with recessions in the 1980s.  And while it’s certainly not your desire—the soft landing is the big hope of everyone—would this FOMC have the courage to endure recessions to bring inflation down if that were the only way necessary?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I think it’s certainly possible that we’ll need to move policy to levels that we see as restrictive as opposed to just neutral.  We can’t know that today.  That hesitate to do it.  I’ll say again, there’s no bright line, you know, that you’re stepping over.  You’re really looking at what our policy stance is and what the market is forecasting for it.  You’re looking at financial conditions and how that’s affecting the economy and making a judgment.  You know, we won’t be arguing about whose model of the neutral rate is better than the other one.  It’s much more about a practical application of our policy tools.  And we’re absolutely prepared to do that.  It—wouldn’t hesitate if that’s what it takes. So I am, of course—who isn’t an admirer of Paul Volcker?  I shouldn’t be singled out in this respect.  But I knew him just a little bit and have tremendous admiration for him.  And I—But I would phrase it this way:  He had the courage to do what he thought was the right thing.  That’s what it was.  It wasn’t a particular thing.  It was that he always did—he always did—what he thought was the right thing.  If you read his last autobiography, that really comes through.  So that’s [what] the test is.  It isn’t, will we do one particular thing?  May 4, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL I would say, we do see, though—we see restoring price stability as absolutely essential for the country in coming years.  Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anybody, really.  And so it’s really essential, particularly for the labor market.  If you think about it, like if you look at the last cycle, we had a very, very—longest expansion cycle in our recorded history.  In the last two, three years, you had the benefits of this tight labor market going to people in the lower quartiles.  And it was, you know, racial, wealth, and income—not wealth, but income gaps were coming down, wage gaps.  So it’s a really great thing.  We’d all love to get back to that place.  But to get back to anything like that place, you need price stability.  So, basically, we’ve been hit by historically large inflationary shocks since the pandemic.  This isn’t anything like regular business.  This is, we have a pandemic, we have the highest unemployment, you know, in—since the Depression.  Then we have this outsized response from fiscal policy and monetary policy.  Then we have inflation.  Then we have a war in Ukraine, which is cutting the commodity, you know, patch in half.  And now we have these shutdowns in China.  So it’s been a series of inflationary shocks that are really different from anything people have seen in 40 years.  So we have to look through that and look at the economy that’s coming out the other side.  And we need to somehow find price stability out of this.  And it’s obviously going to be very challenging, I think, because you do have, you know, numerous supply shocks, which are famously difficult to deal with.  So I guess that’s how I think about it. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris Rugaber. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.  Earlier, you just said that if necessary—I think were the words—that you would, or if it, if it turned out to be necessary, or you said that it’s possible that we’ll need to move policy to restrictive levels.  Given where inflation is and the hot economy is—or, certainly, the hot labor market, as you  May 4, 2022  described it—why still the hesitation?  I mean, what else do you need to see in order to   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL determine that?  Wouldn’t the Fed naturally be looking to go to a restrictive level at this point?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I didn’t—if I said “necessary,” I meant to say “appropriate.”  We’re not going to be erecting a high barrier for this.  It’s more, if we think it’s appropriate.  You know, the point is, we’re a very long way from neutral now.  We’re moving there expeditiously, and we’ll continue to do so.  And we can’t make that decision, really, today.  The you know, I expect we’ll get there expeditiously, as I’ve mentioned.  So it’s not that we don’t want to—making that decision today wouldn’t really mean anything.  But I’ll say again, if we do believe that it’s appropriate to go to those levels, we won’t hesitate. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Michael McKee. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mike McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  The balance sheet—why did you decide to wait until June 1st to begin letting securities roll off and not immediately start in the middle of this month, say?  And do you have another, a newer or a better, estimate for the monetary policy impact of letting the balance sheet decline?  And then, finally, I’m just curious why you felt the need to address the American people at the top of your remarks?  Are you concerned about Fed credibility with the American people?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, why June 1?  It was just, pick a date, you know, and that happened to be the date that we picked.  It was—nothing magic about it.  You know, it’s not going to have any macroeconomic significance over time.  We just picked that.  Sometimes we publish these calendars on the first day of the month, and that’s what we’re doing.  I wouldn’t read anything into it.  In terms of the effect, I mean, I would just stress how uncertain the effect  May 4, 2022  is of shrinking the balance sheet.  You know, we run these models—and everyone does in this   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL field—and make estimates of what will be, how do you measure, you know, a certain quantum of balance sheet shrinkage compared to quantitative easing?  And, you know, these are very uncertain.  I really can’t be any clearer.  There won’t be any clearer [estimates].  You know, people estimate that, broadly, on the path we’re on—and this will be taken, probably, too seriously—but sort of ¼ percent, one rate increase over the course of a year at this pace.  But I would just say, with very wide uncertainty bands—very wide.  We don’t really know.  There are other estimates that are much smaller than that, by the way.  And some of you may read about that.  That’s kind of a mainstream estimate.  We know that it is part of returning to more normal, more neutral financial conditions.  And, you know, our strategy is to set up a plan and have it operate and really have, you know, have the interest rate be the active tool of monetary policy.  In terms of speaking to the American people, so I feel like sometimes I just want to remind us, really, that that’s who we work for, and that it’s inflation that people are feeling all over the country.  And it’s very important that they know that we know how painful it is and that we are working hard on fixing it.  I thought it was quite important to do that.  And so that was really the thinking behind that. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Do you think the Fed has a credibility problem? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  No, I don’t.  And a good example of why would be—in the fourth quarter of last year, as we started talking about tapering sooner and then raising rates this year, you saw financial markets reacting, you know, very appropriately.  Not to bless any particular day’s measure, but the way financial markets, the forward rate curve has tightened in response to our guidance and our actions really amplifies our policy.  It’s—monetary policy is working through expectations now, to a very large extent.  We’ve only done two rate increases.  But if  May 4, 2022  you look at financial conditions, the two-year [rate] is at 280 [basis points] now.  In September, I   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   think it was at 20 basis points. And that’s all through the economy.  People are feeling those higher rates already.  And so that shows that the markets think that our forward guidance is credible.  And I think we want to keep it that way. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Scott Horsley.  [No response]  Okay.  Brian Cheung. 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi there.  Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  To expand on Steve’s question about Paul Volcker, there was also a great pain that came with that as well—higher interest rates, obviously affecting households and businesses.  I’m wondering how you kind of square what might be demand disruption.  Are you already seeing that?  Is the idea here to incentivize a lack of spending, to decrease consumption, to perhaps table business investments?  Is that essentially what’s happening through this hiking cycle?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so, as I mentioned, you can see places where the demand is substantially in excess of supply.  And what you’re seeing as a result of that is prices going up and at unsustainable levels, levels that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation.  And so what our tools do is that as we raise interest rates, demand moderates:  it moves down.  Interest rates, you know—businesses will invest a little bit less, consumers will spend a little bit less.  That’s how it works.  But, ultimately, getting those, getting supply and demand back, you know, back in balance, is what gives us 2 percent inflation, which is what gives the economy a footing where people can lead successful economic lives and not worry about inflation.  I mean, so, yes, there in not dealing with inflation and allowing it to become entrenched. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Greg Robb.   May 4, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  I was wondering if you could take a step back and talk about, in March the dot plot had, you know, looked like steady quarter-point rate hikes, get the funds rate up to 2 percent at the end of the year.  Now—where it seems like you’re much more aggressive.  So could you talk about the thinking that’s behind that?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, look, I think what you’ve seen is—really, I would say, in the middle of last fall—there was a time when our policy stance was still pretty much in sync with what the data were saying.  If you remember, there were a couple of weak jobs reports.  And inflation—month by month, inflation had come down till September, a few months in a row, stayed low.  And then around the end of October, we got three or four really strong readings that just said, no, this is a much stronger economy.  And by the way—then, with the restatement of the jobs numbers, it looked like the job market was much more even and stronger in the second half of the year.  But that hadn’t happened yet.  Anyway, we got an ECI reading—employment compensation, [employment cost] index reading—the Friday before the November meeting.  Then we got a really strong jobs report.  Then we got a really high CPI report.  And so I think it became clear to the Committee that we needed to adjust and adapt.  And we have.  Ever since then, really ever since then, we’ve been adapting.  We, you know—the Committee moved by the time of the December meeting to a median [in participants’ 2022 projections] of three rate increases, then to a median of seven increases at the March meeting.  And that process is going on.  And it’s clearly continuing.  And that’s why I say—and I actually mentioned this at the days, because we’re in a fast-evolving situation.  And that’s what’s happened.  You can see—unanimous vote today, of course.  And I told you the guidance—that broad support on the  May 4, 2022  Committee to have 50-basis-point hikes on the table at the next couple of meetings.  So you’re   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL right.  And by the way, other forecasters have been doing the same thing.  And it’s just us adapting to the data and to the situation and using our tools to deal with it. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thanks.  We’ll go to Nancy for the last question.  

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Hi.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, I want to ask how you’re able to balance your dual mandate—stable prices and maximum employment—especially when the unemployment rate for Black workers is still roughly double, roughly twice the rate for white workers. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So unemployment rates for all racial groups have come down a lot and are now much closer to where they were before the pandemic hit.  So that’s one thing I would say.  And that’s important.  But the bigger point is this:  I do not, at this time, see the two sides of the mandate as in tension.  I don’t, because you can see that the labor market is out of balance.  You can see that there’s a labor shortage.  There aren’t enough people to fill these job openings.  And companies can’t hire, and wages are moving up at levels that would not, over time, be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.  And, of course, everyone loves to see wages go up.  And it’s a great thing, but you want them to go up at a sustainable level, because these wages are, to some extent, being eaten up by inflation.  So, what that really means is, to get the kind of labor market we really want to get, we really want to have a labor market that serves all Americans, especially the people in the lower-income part of the distribution, especially them.  To do that, you’ve got to have price stability.  And we’ve got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people’s wages aren’t being eaten up by inflation and where we can have a long expansion, too.  That’s—the good things you can have, as we have.  We’ve had—several of the longest expansions in U.S. history have been in the last 40 years, and that’s  May 4, 2022  because it’s been a time of low inflation.  And long expansions are good for people and good for   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   the labor market.  So that’s the way I think about it.  I think we—you know, our tools work.  We have to think in the, in the medium and longer term.  And I do think that the best thing for everyone is for us to get back to price stability to support, really, a sustained period of strong labor market conditions.  Thanks very much.   ",other,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
51,2022-06-15,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  I will begin with one overarching message:  We at the Fed understand the hardship that high inflation is causing.  We are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down, and we’re moving expeditiously to do so.  We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.  The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient.  It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. From the standpoint of our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see:  The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high.  Against this backdrop, today the Federal Open Market Committee raised its policy interest rate by ¾ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in that rate will be appropriate.  In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.  I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. Overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, as unusually sharp swings in inventories and net exports more than offset continued strong underlying demand.  Recent indicators suggest that real GDP growth has picked up this quarter, with consumption spending remaining strong.  In contrast, growth in business fixed investment appears to be slowing, and activity in the housing sector looks to be softening, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates.  The tightening in financial conditions that we’ve seen in recent months should continue to temper growth and help bring demand into better balance with supply.  As shown in our Summary of  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL Economic Projections, FOMC participants have marked down their projections for economic activity, with the median projection for real GDP growth running below 2 percent through 2024. The labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and wage growth elevated.  Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 408,000 jobs per month, down from the average pace seen earlier in the year but still robust.  Improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics.  Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since January.  FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance, easing the upward pressures on wages and prices.  The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises somewhat over the next few years, moving from 3.7 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent in 2024, levels that are noticeably above the March projections. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.  Over the 12 months ending in April, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 4.9 percent.  In May, the 12-month change in the consumer price index came in above expectations at 8.6 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6 percent.  Aggregate demand is strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broad range of goods and services.  The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is boosting prices for gasoline and food and is creating additional upward pressure on inflation.  

[SECTION]

And COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions.  FOMC participants have revised up their projections for inflation this year, particularly for total  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL PCE inflation given developments in food and energy prices.  The median projection is 5.2 percent this year and falls to 2.6 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2024.  Participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside. The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. Against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting, and it will continue to do so.  At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¾ percentage point, resulting in a 1½ percentage point increase in the target range so far this year.  The Committee reiterated that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.  And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet—which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. Coming out of our last meeting in May, there was a broad sense on the Committee that a ½ percentage point increase in the target range should be considered at this meeting if economic and financial conditions evolved in line with expectations.  We also stated that we were highly attentive to inflation risks and that we would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.  Since then, inflation has again surprised to the upside, some indicators of inflation expectations have risen, and projections for inflation this year have been revised up notably.  In response to these developments, the Committee decided that a larger increase in the  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL target range was warranted at today’s meeting.  This continues our approach of expeditiously moving our policy rate up to more normal levels.  And it will help ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. As shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 3.4 percent at the end of this year, 1.5 percentage points higher than projected in March and 0.9 percentage point above the median estimate of its longer-run value.  The median projection rises further to 3.8 percent at the end of next year and declines to 3.4 percent in 2024, still above the median longer-run value.  Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee plan or decision, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent.  We anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate; the pace of those changes will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.  Clearly, today’s 75 basis point increase is an unusually large one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common.  From the perspective of today, either a 50 basis point or a 75 basis point increase seems most likely at our next meeting.  We will, however, make our decisions meeting by meeting, and we will continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as we can.  Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways.  Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store.  We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.  And we will strive to avoid  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL adding uncertainty in what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time.  We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability.  The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy. To conclude:  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  Thank you.  And I look forward to your questions.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Two related questions.  Chair Powell, do you feel you boxed yourself in with the language you used at the last press conference on 50 basis point hikes in June and July?  And would you please give us as detailed a sense as you can of what role you played in reshaping market expectations so quickly on Monday? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, as you know, we always aim to provide as much clarity as we can about our policy intentions subject to the inherent uncertainty in the economic outlook, because we think monetary policy is more effective when market participants understand how policy will evolve, when they understand our objective function, our reaction function.  And in the current highly unusual circumstances with inflation well above our goal, we think it’s helpful to provide even more clarity than usual—again, subject to uncertainty in the outlook.  And I think over the course of this year, financial markets have responded and have, generally, shown that they understand the path we’re laying out.  Of course, it remains data dependent.   June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL And so that’s what we generally think about guidance, and that’s why we offer it.  And, of course, when we offered that—when I offered that guidance at the last meeting, I did say that it was subject to the economy performing about in line with expectations.  I also said that if the economy performed—if data came in worse than expected, then we would consider moving even more aggressively.  So we got the CPI data and also some data on inflation expectations late last week, and we thought for a while, and we thought, well, this is the appropriate thing to do.  So then the question is, what do you do?  And do you wait six weeks to do it at the next meeting?  And I think the answer is, that’s not where we are with this.  So we decided we needed to go ahead, and so we did.  And that’s really—that’s really how we made the decision.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Jeanna.  

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Thanks for taking our questions.  Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.  You—I guess I wonder if you could describe for us a little bit how you’re deciding how aggressive you need to be.  So, obviously, 75 today.  What did 75 achieve that 50 wouldn’t have, and why not just go for a full percentage point at some point?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So if you take a step back, what we’re looking for is compelling evidence that inflationary pressures are abating and that inflation is moving back down.  And we’d like to see that in the form of a series of declining monthly inflation readings—that’s what we’re looking for.  And, by this point, we had actually been expecting to see clear signs of at least inflation flattening out and, ideally, beginning to decline.  We’ve said that we’d be data dependent, focused on incoming data, highly attentive to inflation risks—the things that I mentioned to Howard moments ago. So contrary to expectations, inflation again surprised to the upside.  Indicators—some indicators of inflation expectations have risen, and projections of [inflation] this year have  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL moved up notably.  So we thought that strong action was warranted at this meeting, and today we delivered that in the form of a 75 basis point rate hike, as I mentioned.  So the point of it, really, is this:  We’ve been moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels, and over the course of the seven months since we pivoted and began moving in this direction, we’ve seen financial conditions tighten, and appropriately so.  But the federal funds rate, even after this move, is at 1.6 percent.  So, again, the Committee is moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels, and we came to the view that we’d like to do a little more front-end loading on that.  So I think that the SEP gives you the levels that people think are appropriate at given points in time.  This was really about the speed in which we would get there.  So, as I mentioned, 75 basis points today—I said the next meeting could well be about a decision between 50 and 75.  That would put us, at the end of the July meeting, in that range—in that more normal range, and that’s a desirable place to be, because you begin to have more optionality there about the speed with which you would proceed going forward. Just talking about the SEP for a second:  What it really says is that Committee participants widely would like to see policy at a modestly restricted—restrictive level at the end of this year.  And that’s six months from now, and so much data [can accrue] and so much can happen, so remember how highly uncertain this is.  But so that is generally a range of 3 to 3½ percent.  That’s where people are, and that’s what they want to see, knowing what they know now and understanding that we need to be—we need to show resolve but also be flexible [in responding] to incoming data as we see it.  If things are better, we don’t need to do that much, and if they’re not, then we either do that much or possibly even more.  But in any case, it will be very data dependent.  Then you’re looking at next year, and what you’re seeing is, people see more—a bit more tightening and a range of maybe 3½ to 4 percent.  And that’s generally what  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL people see as the appropriate path for getting inflation under control and starting back down and getting back down to 2 percent.  So 75 basis points seemed like the right thing to do at this meeting, and that’s what we did.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve.

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Thank you for taking my question, Mr. Chairman.  You have not used the phrase in a long time “monetary policy is in a good place,” which is a phrase that you used to use often.  Now that the Committee is projecting 4 percent on a—or 3.8 percent next year in terms of the funds rate, which is similar to where the market is now, the futures market of 4 percent funds rate next year, do you think that’s a level that is going to be sufficiently high enough to deal with and bring down the inflation problem?  And just as a follow-up, could you break that apart for me?  How much of that is restrictive, and how much of that is a normal positive rate that ought to be embedded or not, in your opinion, in the funds rate? Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So the question really is, how high does the rate really need to go?  And this is—the estimates on the Committee are in that range of 3½ to 4 percent.  And how do you think about that?  Well, you can think about the longer-run neutral rate, you can compare it to that, and we think that’s in the mid-2s.  You can look, frankly, at broader financial conditions.  You can look at asset prices, you can look at the effect they’re having on the economy, rates, asset prices, credit spreads—all of those things go into that.  You can also look at the yield curve and ask, all along the yield curve, where is the policy rate?  So for much of the yield curve now, real rates are positive.  That’s not true at the short end.  At the short end of the yield curve in the early years, you don’t have real—you have negative rates still.  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL So that really is one data point—it’s one part of financial conditions.  So I think—I have to look at it this way:  We move the policy rate.  That affects financial conditions.  And that affects the economy.  We have, of course, ways—rigorous ways to think about it, but, ultimately, it comes down to, do we think financial conditions are in a place where they’re having the desired effect on the economy?  And that desired affect is, we’d like to see demand moderating.  Demand is very hot still in the economy.  We’d like to see the labor market getting better in balance between supply and demand, and that can happen [as a result of developments coming] both from supply and demand.  Right now, there’s—demand is substantially higher than available supply, though, so we feel that there’s a role for us in moderating demand.  Those are the things we can affect with our policy tools.  There are many things we can’t affect, and those would be, you know, the things—the commodity price issues that we’re having around the world due to the war in Ukraine and the fallout from that, and also just all of the supply-side things that are still pushing upward on inflation.  So that’s really how I think—how I think about it. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  But does 3.8 percent, 4 percent get it done?  Does it get the job done on breaking the back of inflation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I think it’s certainly in the range of plausible numbers.  I think we’ll know when we get there really.  I mean, honestly, though, that would be—you would have positive real rates, I think, and inflation coming down by then.  I think you’d have positive real rates across the [yield] curve.  I think that the neutral rate is pretty low these days.  So I would think it would, but you know what?  We’re going to find that out empirically.  We’re not going to be completely model driven about this.  We’re going to be looking at this, keeping our eyes open, and reacting to incoming data both on financial conditions and on what’s happening in the economy.  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks.  Nick Timiraos.  Chair Powell, you’ve said that you like your policy to work through expectations.  And now, obviously, this decision was something quite different from how you and almost all of your colleagues had set those expectations during the intermeeting period.  And I know you just said that what changed was really the inflation data—the inflation expectations data.  But I’m wondering, on the inflation expectations data, was there something you saw that was unsettling enough to risk eroding the credibility of your verbal guidance by doing something so different from what you had “socialized” before? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So if you look at a broad range of inflation expectations—so you’ve got the public, you’ve got surveys of the public and of experts, and you’ve also got market based.  And I think if you look across that broad range of data, what you see is that expectations are still in the place, very much in the place, where short-term inflation is going to be high but comes down sharply over the next couple of years.  And that’s really where inflation expectations are.  And also, as you get away from this episode, they get back down close to 2 percent.  And so this is really very important to us—that that remain the case.  And I think if you look for most measures, most of the time, that’s what you see.  If we even see a couple of indicators that bring that into question, we take that very seriously.  We do not take this for granted—we take it very seriously.  So the preliminary Michigan [survey] reading—it’s a preliminary reading; it might be revised—nonetheless, it was quite eye-catching, and we noticed that.  We also noticed that the index of common inflation expectations at the Board has moved up after being pretty flat for a long time, so we’re watching that, and we’re thinking, “this is something we need to take seriously.”  And that is one of the factors, as I mentioned—one of the factors in our deciding to move ahead with 75 basis points today was what we saw in inflation expectations.  We’re  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL absolutely determined to keep them anchored at 2 percent.  That was one of the reasons—the other was just the CPI reading. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  So if you saw a movement like that again, another tick-up in inflation expectations, would that put a 75 or even 100 basis point increase in play at your next meeting? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We’re going to—I’ll just say, we’re going to react to the incoming data and appropriately, I think.  So I wouldn’t want to put a number on what that might be.  The main thing is to get rates up, and then pretty soon, we’ll be in an area where we’re—I think as you get closer to the end of the year, you’re in a range where you’ve got restrictive policy, which is appropriate.  Forty-year highs in inflation—we think that policy is going to need to be restrictive, and we don’t know how restrictive.  So I think that’s how we’ll take it. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH. Neil.  

[SECTION]

NEIL IRWIN.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin from Axios.  Thanks for taking our questions.  The late-breaking kind of decision to go to 75 basis points—do you worry that that will make policy guidance a less effective tool in the future?  And should we think of that as a kind of symmetrical reaction function if we start to get soft readings on inflation or if the labor 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  To take your second question first, yes.  I mean, I think we’re—again, we’re going, we’re resolved to take this on, but we’re going to be flexible in the implementation of it.  Sorry—and your [first] question was [about] guidance.  So, again, the overall exercise is that we try to be—provide as much clarity about our policy intentions as we can, because we think that makes monetary policy work better.  There’s always a tradeoff, because you have to live with that guidance, and so you do it, and it helps a lot of the time.  I,  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL frankly, think this year has been a demonstration of how well it can work.  With us having really just done very little in the way of raising interest rates, financial conditions have tightened quite significantly through the expectations channel, as we’ve made it clear what our plans are.  So I think that’s been a very healthy thing to be happening.  And I would hope that our—it’s always going to be—any guidance that we give is always going to be subject to things working out about as we expect.  And, in this particular situation, you know, we’re looking for something specific, and that is progress on inflation.  We want to see progress.  We want to see—inflation can’t go down until it flattens out, and that’s what we’re looking to see.  And if we don’t see that, then that’s the kind of thing that will—even if we don’t see progress for a longer period, that could cause us to react.  But we will.  Soon enough, we will be seeing some progress at some point.  And we’ll react [as] appropriate to that, too.  But I would like to think, though, that our guidance is still credible, but it’s always going to be conditional on what happens.  This is an unusual situation, to get, you know, some data late in, during blackout, pretty close to—very close to our meeting.  Very unusual to [have] one that would actually change the outcome.  So I’ve only seen—in my 10-years-plus here at the Fed, I’ve only seen something like that, even close to that, one or two times.  So I don’t think it’s something that’ll come up a great deal.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Colby. 

[SECTION]

COLBY SMITH.  Thank you so much for taking our questions.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times.  On the “clear and convincing” threshold for the inflation trajectory, what is the level of realized inflation that meets that criteria?  And how is the Committee thinking about the potential tradeoff of much higher unemployment than even in what’s forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating at this acceptable pace? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  The second part I didn’t get.  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

COLBY SMITH.  What’s the potential tradeoff with higher unemployment than even what’s forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating at an acceptable pace? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So, what we want to see is a series of declining monthly readings for inflation, and we’d like to see inflation headed down.  But, you know—and right now, our policy rate is well below neutral, right?  So, soon enough, we’ll have our policy rate—let’s assume the world works out about like the SEP says:  The policy rate will be up where we think it should be.  And then the question would be:  Do you slow down?  Does it make you—you’ll be making these judgments about, is it appropriate now to slow down—from 50 to 25, let’s say—or speed up?  So that’s the kind of thinking we’ll be doing, and, again, we’re looking—ultimately, we’re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see convincing evidence, compelling evidence, that inflation is coming down.  And that’s what I mean by—that’s what it would take for us to say, “Okay, we think this job is done.”  Because we saw—and, frankly, we saw last year—inflation came down over the course of the summer and then turned right around and went back up.  So I think we’re going to be careful about declaring victory.  But our—again, the implementation of our policy is going to be flexible and sensitive to incoming data. 

[SECTION]

COLBY SMITH.  Are you more concerned now that to bring down inflation, it’s going to require more than just some pain at this point? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Again, I think that—I do think that our objective, and this is what’s reflected in the SEP, but our objective, really, is to bring inflation down to 2 percent while the labor market remains strong.  I think that what’s becoming more clear is that many factors that we don’t control are going to play a very significant role in deciding whether that’s possible or not.  And there I’m thinking, of course, of commodity prices, the war in Ukraine, supply chain  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL [developments], things like that, where we really—the monetary policy stance doesn’t affect those things.  But having said that, there is a path for us to get there—it’s not getting easier; it’s getting more challenging because of these external forces—and that path is to move demand down, and you have a lot of surplus demand.  Take, for example, in the labor market.  So you have two job vacancies, essentially, for every person actively seeking a job, and that has led to a real imbalance in wage negotiating.  You could get to a place where that ratio was at a more normal level, and you wouldn’t—you would expect to see those wage pressures move back down to a level where people are still getting healthy wage increases, real wage increases, but at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation.  So that’s a possibility.  And you could say the same thing about some of the product markets where there’s just excess capacity and really where the strong demand has gone into—sorry, where they’re capacity constrained, right?  So you have, effectively, what we think of as a vertical supply curve or close to it.  So demand comes in, and it’s very strong, and it shows up in higher prices—not higher quantities, not more cars, because they can’t make the cars because they don’t have the semiconductors.  So in principle, that could work in reverse.  When demand comes down, you could see—and it’s not guaranteed—but you could see prices coming down more than the typical economic relationships that you see in the textbooks would suggest, because of the unusual situation we’re in on the supply side.  So there’s a pathway there.  It is not going to be easy, and there—again, it’s our objective, but, as I mentioned, it’s going to depend to some extent on factors we don’t control. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel. 

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you for taking our questions.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.  So the new projections show the unemployment rate ticking up through 2024.  Is a higher unemployment rate necessary in order to combat inflation?  And  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL what is lost if the unemployment rate has to go up and people lose their jobs in order to control inflation?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So you’re right.  In the SEP, we have unemployment going up to 4 point—the median is 4.1 percent—of course, [there is] a range of actual forecasts.  And I would characterize that, if you were to get inflation down to, you know, on its way down to 2 percent and the unemployment rate went up to 4.1 percent, that’s still a historically low level.  We hadn’t seen—we hadn’t seen rates, unemployment rates below 4 percent until a couple years ago for—we’d seen it for, like, one year in the last 50.  So the idea that—3.6 percent is historically low in the last century.  So a 4.1 percent unemployment rate with inflation well on its way to 2 percent—I think that would be—I think that would be a successful outcome.  So we’re not looking to have a higher unemployment rate.  But I would say that I would certainly look at that as a successful outcome. 

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Would that include people losing their jobs? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We’re not—again, we’re not, we don’t seek to put people out of work, of course.  We never think, “Too many people are working, and fewer people need to have jobs.”  But we also think that you really cannot have the kind of labor market we want without price stability.  And we have to go back and establish price stability so we can have that kind of labor market, and that’s a labor market where workers are getting wage increases—maybe the workers at the lower end of the spectrum are getting the biggest wage increases, as they were before the pandemic—where participation is high, where there’s lots of job opportunities, where it’s just a really—I mean, the labor market we had before the pandemic was—that’s what we want to get back to.  And you see disparities between various groups at historic lows.  We’d love to get back to that place.  But, to get there—it’s not going to happen with the levels of inflation  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL we have.  So we have to restore that, and it really is in service, in the medium and longer term, of the kind of labor market we want and hope to achieve. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Matt. 

[SECTION]

MATTHEW BOESLER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg.  So, as you just mentioned, the Committee is now projecting a ½ percentage point rise in the unemployment rate and the SEPs over the next couple of years, and it removed a line from its policy statement about thinking that the labor market can remain strong while it tightens policy.  You just mentioned that that is still your objective, though, so I’m wondering if you could explain why that line was removed from the statement—also whether this means the FOMC is trying to induce a recession now to bring inflation down. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Not trying to induce a recession now.  Let’s be clear about that.  We’re trying to achieve 2 percent inflation consistent with a strong labor market.  That’s what we’re trying to do.  So let me talk about that sentence.  Clearly, it’s our goal to bring about 2 percent inflation while keeping the labor market strong, right?  And that’s kind of what the unemployment at 4.1 percent.  And this is a strong labor market—this is a good labor market. And, as I mentioned, there are pathways to do it.  But those pathways have become much more challenging due to factors that are not under our control.  Again, thinking here of the fallout from the war in Ukraine, which has brought a spike in prices of energy, food, fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and also just the supply chains more broadly, which have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated.  So the sentence that we deleted said that we believe that appropriate monetary policy, effectively alone, can bring about the result of 2 percent inflation with a strong labor market.  And so much of it is really not down to monetary policy.  It just didn’t—the  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL sentence isn’t—it kind of says on its face that monetary policy alone can do this.  And that’s not—that just didn’t seem appropriate, so we took the sentence out. 

[SECTION]

MATTHEW BOESLER.  And given the new projections for the unemployment rate, could you talk a little bit about what accounts for such reduced confidence against, say, a month ago or three months ago that inflation will largely normalize on its own as these supply-side issues get worked out?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, yeah, I think you’ve seen—again, we’ve been expecting progress, and we didn’t get that.  We got sort of the opposite.  So I also think the situation, really—since the consequences of the Ukraine war become more and more clear, what you’re seeing is the situation getting more difficult.  And you look around the world—I mean, lots of countries are—lots of countries are looking at inflation of 10 percent, and it’s largely due to commodities prices.  But all over the world, you’re seeing these effects.  And so—and we’re seeing them here:  gas prices at all-time highs, and things like that.  That’s not something we can do something about.  So that is really—and, by the way, headline inflation, headline inflation is important for expectations.  People—the public’s expectations, why would they be distinguishing between core inflation and headline inflation?  Core inflation is something we [on the Committee] think about because it is a better predictor of future inflation.  But headline inflation is what people experience.  They don’t know what core is.  Why would they?  They have no reason to.  So that’s—expectations are very much at risk due to high headline inflation.  So it’s become—the environment has become more difficult, clearly, in the last four or five months, and hence the need for the policy actions that we took today.  Hence our resolution to get rates up and, ultimately, get them to where we think they need to be in coming months.  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.  I wanted to ask you—you talked about CPI going to 8.6 percent, that retail sales surprised the contacts about consumers slowing spending or changing their habits? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we’re, of course, watching very, very carefully for that and looking at the retail—the big store numbers and all that kind of thing.  And so I—but I think the fair summary of what we see is, you see continuing shifts in consumption, you see some things getting—sales going down, but overall spending is very strong.  The consumer’s in really good shape financially.  They’re spending.  There’s no sign of a broader slowdown that I can see in the economy.  People are talking about it a lot—consumer confidence is very low.  That’s probably related to gas prices and also just stock prices to some extent for other people.  But that’s what we’re seeing.  We’re not seeing a broad slowdown.  We see job growth slowing, but it’s still at quite robust levels.  We see the economy slowing a bit but still growth levels—healthy growth levels. watching more closely? 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  So then as you are raising rates in this economy, how closely are you watching consumer spending, or is there something—another indicator that you’re 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  It would be hard to watch anything much more closely than we watch consumer spending, but we watch everything.  We watch business fixed investment, which actually has softened a bit.  And we watch—we’re responsible for watching everything.  Consumption is 60-some percent of the economy, two-thirds of the economy, so, naturally, we spend a lot of time on that.  And, again, there’s a lot going on—there are a lot of flows back and  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL forth—but, ultimately, it does appear that the U.S. economy is in a strong position and well positioned to deal with higher interest rates. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Michael McKee. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  Are you targeting headline inflation now or core inflation?  In other words, how far would you chase oil prices if they keep going up?  If that’s going to be the component that drives expectations, would you risk recession for a headline rate if the core rate is holding steady or starting to go down? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So the—we’re responsible for inflation in the law.  And inflation means headline inflation.  So that’s our ultimate goal.  We, of course, like all central banks do, look very, very carefully at core inflation because it is—it’s a much better predictor, and it’s much—it’s a much better predictor of where inflation is going, and it’s also more relevant to our tools.  As I mentioned, the parts that don’t go into core are mostly outside the scope of our tools, so we look at that.  But it’s—the current situation is particularly difficult because of what I mentioned about expectations.  We can’t affect, really—I mean, the energy prices are set by global commodity prices.  And most of food—not all of it, but most food prices are pretty heavily influenced by global commodity prices, too.  Also other things.  So we can’t really have much of an effect.  But we have to be mindful of the potential effect on inflation expectations [coming] from headline [inflation readings].  So it’s a very difficult situation to be in, and we—again, we can’t do much about the difference between [headline and core inflation rates due to] the elements that make up headline that are not in core. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Could I just, as a follow-up, get a clarification on the SEP?  When the members gave their forecasts, when were they inserted into the record?  Were they revised  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL after the CPI or Michigan numbers came out?  In other words, does the SEP, as we have it now, reflect the same factors that led you to go to a 75 basis point move? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  The SEP is of one piece.  It reflects all of the economic readings.  It also reflects the 75 basis point increase.  This is important.  So people had that in hand when they—when their SEPs were submitted.  So it’s—in other words, it’s not in addition to what’s in the SEP.  The SEP—everyone’s SEP reflects their thinking about this rate increase and what’s going forward.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Victoria Guida from Politico.  I wanted to ask about how you’re measuring progress, especially since you’ve now started front-loading rate hikes more.  You’ve talked about how you want to see inflation coming down over a series of reports, and I guess I’m curious whether you think inflation data itself is a really good indicator or whether you might be concerned that it’s a lagging indicator or that it might send confusing signals given that, as you’ve talked about, there are sort of supply and demand aspects.  And I guess my question is, do you think that inflation will tell you—inflation data will tell you when you’ve gone to where you need to go, or do you just feel like maybe it’s better to overshoot than to undershoot?   

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I think the role that we can play—maybe the way to get at this is to say that the role that we can play is around demand, right?  And we’ll be able to see—the areas that we can affect are those associated with excess demand, and we’ll be able to see our effect on, for example, job openings in real time.  And that would tell us what’s—that would tell us about wages.  Wages are not principally responsible for the inflation that we’re seeing, but, going forward, they would be very important, particularly in the service sector.  Sorry, I’m not sure I’m getting to your question. June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  My question is, is inflation data itself the best indicator for when you’re getting to where you need to go, or might it lead you to go too far? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  There’s always a risk of going too far or going not far enough, and it’s going to be a very difficult judgment to make, or maybe not—maybe it’ll be really clear.  But we’re—and we’re quite mindful of the dangers.  But I will say, the worst mistake we could make would be to fail, which—it’s not an option.  We have to restore price stability.  We really do, because everything—it’s the bedrock of the economy.  If you don’t have price stability, the economy’s really not going to work the way it’s supposed to.  It won’t work for people—their wages will be eaten up.  So we want to get the job done.  This inflation happened relatively recently.  We don’t think that it’s affecting expectations in any kind of fundamental way.  We don’t think that we’re seeing a wage–price spiral.  We think that the public generally sees us as very likely to be successful in getting inflation down to 2 percent, and that’s critical.  It’s absolutely key to the whole thing that we sustain that confidence.  So that’s how we’re thinking about it. 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  I just want to expand, I guess, on what you just said now about the general public feeling like you can get this done.  You talk about consumer sentiment being down, also inflation expectations being up, recession just broadly being dinner table talk.  Does the general feel among American households and also businesses square with your explanation of the economy, given that the description of inflation in the statement didn’t change between May and June?  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, clearly, people don’t like inflation—a lot.  And many people are experiencing it, really, for the first time, because we haven’t had anything like this kind of inflation in 40 years.  And it’s really something people don’t like.  And they’re experiencing that,  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL and that’s showing up in their—in surveys and in all kinds of ways.  And we understand that, and we understand the hardship that people are experiencing from high inflation, and we’re determined to do what we can to get inflation back down.  So that’s really what we’re saying.  We’re not—I’m not—clearly, it’s an incredibly unpopular thing, and it’s very painful for people.  I guess what I’m saying is, the question, the really critical question from the perspective of doing our job is making sure that the public does have confidence that we have the tools and will use them and they do work to bring inflation back down over time.  It will take some time, we think, to get inflation back down, but we will do that. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris. 

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.  You have talked about inflation a few times and mentioned oil prices, China lockdowns.  But aside from rises in commodity prices such as gas prices, we’re also seeing stickier measures of inflation increasing, such as the Cleveland Fed’s median and trimmed mean CPIs.  I mean, how persistent do you see those underlying measures of inflation, and how do you expect to—where do you see those going in the near future? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, as I mentioned, I think, in my opening statement, inflation has started—it started off in quite narrow, very directly pandemic-related areas, and it’s spread now broadly across the economy and into the services sector as well.  It was really in the goods sector at the beginning.  And, particularly, you’re seeing in travel now, if you’ve flown on a plane lately—planes are very full, and plane tickets are very expensive.  Some of that will be pass-through of energy prices, but it’s—so you’re experiencing services inflation.  Shelter inflation is high.  So the question—and then you see the Cleveland measure going up, and many other measures are going up.  So it’s a time when we’re not seeing progress and we want to see  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL progress, and that’s really another part of why we did what we did today and why the SEP looks like it does.  We see it as appropriate to get the policy rate up to restrictive levels, which would be, in the thinking of the Committee, somewhere in the range of 3 to 3½ percent by year-end.  And then after that, you see what the rest of the SEP says.  So I hope that’s responsive to your question. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Nancy. 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with this point considering the revised projections for unemployment, GDP, inflation? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I think what’s in the SEP would certainly meet that test.  If you see—you’re looking at getting back down to almost a 2 percent inflation by 2024, and the unemployment rate is still as low as 4.1 percent.  That would be—I would call that as meeting that test.  Do I still think that we can do that?  I do.  I think there’s—I think there’s—I don’t want to be the handicapper here.  I just—that is our objective, and I do think it’s possible.  Like I said, though, I think that events of the last few months have raised the degree of difficulty, created great challenges.  And, again, the answer to the question, can we still do it—there’s a much bigger chance now that it’ll depend on factors that we don’t control, which is, fluctuations and spikes in commodity prices could wind up taking that option out of our hands.  So we just don’t know, but we’re focused on—very, very focused on getting inflation back down to 2 percent, which we think is essential for the benefit of the public and also to put us on a path back to a sustainably strong labor market like the one we had before the pandemic.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Greg.  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Chair Powell, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more—economists are worried that you’re kind of hitting the economy with a sledgehammer and that now there’s even more risk of a recession than a   50–50 path of rates.  So could you talk a little bit more about that?  And what evidence would get you to stop rate hikes and maybe even reverse them? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So, as I mentioned, financial conditions have tightened over the last seven months, and that’s a good thing, we think.  But the federal funds rate, even after this increase, is at 1.6 percent.  So it’s hard to see how that is too high of a rate.  And even if we did another—so we’re going to get here by the end of the summer, somewhere in the 2s probably.  Still, that’s still a low rate.  So that’s not a rate that is calculated to bring a recession on.  And we’ll—by then, we’ll have seen a whole lot more data.  As I mentioned a couple times, the Committee’s views are around a modestly restrictive stance, which will be in the 3 to 3½ percent range by the end of this year, but that’s conditioned on that being the appropriate thing to do.  If we see data going in a different direction, it’ll be reflected in our policy, as you see today.  We’ll be watching—if things go in a direction we don’t expect, then we’re going to adapt.  And I would say, this is a highly uncertain environment—extraordinarily uncertain environment.  So, again, we’ll be determined and resolved, but flexible. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Evan.

EVAN RYSER.  Evan Ryser, Market News International.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  I was wondering if the Fed has initiated a review of the conduct of monetary policy over the last two years or so, given the inflation, and will that be shared with the public?  And then, secondly, given the illiquidity and the extraordinary volatility in financial markets, are you concerned that QT will make that worse?  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sorry, what was your question on QT? 

[SECTION]

EVAN RYSER.  Just given the illiquidity and extraordinary volatility in financial 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, of course, we’ve been looking very carefully and hard at why inflation picked up so much more than expected last year and why it proved so persistent.  We—it’s hard to overstate the extent of interest we have in that question morning, noon, and night.  But you have to understand the context.  For—really, the context is this:  For decades before the pandemic and the reopening, you had a world where inflation was dominated by disinflationary forces such as declining population or aging demographics, let’s call it that, globalization enabled by technology, other factors, low productivity.  So and that’s how all the models work is, supply shocks tend to be transient, right?  So we have now experienced an extraordinary series of shocks, if you think about it:  the pandemic, the response, the reopening, inflation, followed by the war in Ukraine, followed by shutdowns in China—the war in Ukraine potentially having effects for years here.  So we’re aware that a different set of forces are driving the economy—we have been, obviously, for quite a while.  But this is a different—these forces are different.  Inflation is behaving differently, and, in our thinking, it really is a question of very strong demand.  But you couldn’t get this kind of inflation without a change on the supply side, which is there for anybody to see, which is these blockages and shortages and people dropping out of the labor force and things like that.  So that’s how we’re looking at it. And we’ve done a lot of work internally on, and thinking about, what all that means.  You don’t—the thing is, you don’t know whether those forces are—to what extent are they going to be sustained?  In other words, will we go back to a world where it looks a little more like the  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL old world, or are we really going to be in a world where major supply shocks go on and on?  The history is, you see these waves of supply shocks, as you did in the ’70s, and then they go away, and sort of there’s a “new normal,” and things settle down.  But, honestly, we don’t know what that’s going to be.  In the meantime, we have to find price stability in this new world and maximum employment in this new world where, clearly, inflationary forces are—you’re seeing them everywhere.  Again, if you look around the world at where inflation levels are, it’s absolutely extraordinary.  It’s not just here.  In fact, we’re sort of in the middle of the pack, although I think we have, of course, a different kind of inflation than other people have, partly because our economy is stronger and more highly recovered.  So that’s what we’re doing.  We’ve done a lot of introspection and work on that and—sorry, on QT, we’ve communicated really clearly to the markets about what we’re going to do there.  Markets seem to be okay with it.  We’re phasing in—Treasury [security] issuance is down quite a lot, quite a lot from where it’s been, so I have no reason to think—markets are forward looking, and they see this coming.  I have no reason to think it will lead to illiquidity and problems.  It seems to be kind of understood and accepted at this point. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thanks.  For the last question, we’ll go to Mark Hamrick. assessment is about the outlook for the housing market, given the years-long increase in home prices and now the sharp rise in mortgage rates.  And all that, of course, given the heightened sensitivity around the housing market given the fact that it was a trigger for the great financial crisis over a decade ago.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So rates were very low—a good place to start is that rates were very, very low for quite a while because of the pandemic and the need to do everything we could  June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL to support the economy when unemployment was 14 percent and the true unemployment rate was well higher than that.  And that was a—rates are low, and now they’re coming back up to more normal, or above, levels.  So, in the meantime, while rates were low and while demand was really high, obviously demand for housing changed from wanting to live in urban areas to some extent to living in single-family homes in the suburbs, famously.  And so the demand was just suddenly much higher.  And we saw prices moving up very, very strongly for the last couple of years.  So that changes now, and rates have moved up—we’re well aware that mortgage rates have moved up a lot—and you’re seeing a changing housing market.  We’re watching it to see what will happen.  How much will it really affect residential investment?  Not really sure.  How much will it affect housing prices?  Not really sure.  It’s—I mean, obviously, we’re watching that quite carefully.  You would think over time—I mean, so there’s a tremendous amount of supply in the housing market of unfinished homes, and as those come on line—whereas the supply of finished homes, inventory of finished homes that are for sale, is incredibly low, historically low.  So it’s still a very tight market.  So prices may keep going up for a while even in a world where rates are up.  So it’s a complicated situation.  We watch it very carefully.  I would say if you’re a homebuyer, somebody or a young person looking to buy a home, you need a bit of a reset.  We need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and where inflation is down low again and mortgage rates are low again.  So this will be a process whereby we—ideally, we do our work in a way that the housing market settles in a new place and housing availability and credit availability are at appropriate levels. So thank you very much.   ",other,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
52,2022-07-27,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down, and we’re moving expeditiously to do so.  We have both the tools we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient.  It is essential that we bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.   From the standpoint of our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see:  The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high.  Against this backdrop, today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ of a percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate.  In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.  And I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.   Recent indicators of spending and production have softened.  Growth in consumer spending has slowed significantly, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions.  Activity in the housing sector has weakened, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates.  And after a strong increase in the first quarter, business fixed investment also looks to have declined in the second quarter.     Despite these developments, the labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth elevated.  Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 375,000 jobs per  July 27, 2022  month—down from the average pace seen earlier in the year, but still robust.  Improvements in   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics.  Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since demand remains solid. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.  Over the 12 months ending in May, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent.  In June, the 12-month change in the consumer price index came in above expectations at 9.1 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 5.9 percent.  Notwithstanding the recent slowdown in overall economic activity, aggregate demand appears to remain strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures are evident across a broad range of goods and services.  Although prices for some commodities have turned down recently, the earlier surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s war on Ukraine has boosted prices for gasoline and food, creating additional upward pressure on inflation.  The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.    July 27, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¾ of a percentage point, bringing the target range to 2¼ to 2½ percent.  And we’re continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent.  We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate; the pace of those increases will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.  Today’s increase is the—in the target range is the second 75 basis point increase in as many meetings.  While another unusually large increase could be appropriate at our next meeting, that is a our decisions meeting by meeting and communicating—and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.  As the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation.  Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring demand into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often involves—evolves in unexpected ways.  Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store.  We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.  And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty in what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time.  We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to return  July 27, 2022  inflation to our 2 percent longer-run goal.  This process is likely to involve a period of below-  Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL trend economic growth and some softening in labor market conditions.  But such outcomes are likely necessary to restore price stability and to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.   To conclude:  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.  I’m wondering if you can walk us through your thinking around the report came in hotter than usual and then, obviously, the June figure did, too.  Was there any discussion of a stronger hike at this meeting?  Yes.  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So we did judge that a 75 basis point increase was the right magnitude in light of the data and in the context of the ongoing increases in the policy rate that we’ve been making.  I’d say that we wouldn’t hesitate to, to make an even larger move than we did today if the Committee were to conclude that that was—that that were appropriate.  That was not the case at this meeting.  There was very broad support for the move that we made.  You mentioned the—the June meeting.  We, we had said many times that we were prepared to move aggressively, more aggressively, if inflation continued to disappoint.  And that’s why we did move to a more aggressive pace at the June meeting, as we said we would do.   July 27, 2022  At this meeting, we continued at that more aggressive pace, as inflation has continued to   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL disappoint, in the form of the June CPI reading.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Colby. 

[SECTION]

COLBY SMITH.  Thank you so much for taking our questions.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times.  As the Committee considers the policy path forward, how will it weigh the expected decline in headline inflation, which might come as a result of the drop in commodity prices, against the fact that we are likely to see some persistence in core readings, in particular?  And given that potential tension and signs of, you know, any kind of activity weakening here, how has the Committee’s thinking changed on how far into restrictive territory rates might need to go?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess I’d start by saying we’ve been saying we would move expeditiously to get to the range of neutral.  And I think we’ve done that now.  We’re at—we’re at 2.25 to 2.5 [percent], and that’s right in the range of what we think is neutral.  So the question is, how are we thinking about the path forward?  So one thing that hasn’t changed is that—won’t change—is that our focus is continuing to—is going to continue to be on using our tools to bring demand back into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down.  That’ll continue to be our overarching focus.  We also said that we expect ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate and that we’ll make looking at the incoming data, as I mentioned, and that’ll start with economic activity.  Are we seeing the slowdown that we—the slowdown in economic activity—that we think we need?  And there’s some evidence that we are at this time.  Of course, we’ll be looking at labor market  July 27, 2022  conditions.  And we’ll be asking whether we see the alignment between supply and demand   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL getting better, getting closer.   Of course, we’ll be looking closely at inflation.  You mentioned headline and core.  Our mandate is for headline, of course; it’s not for core.  But we look at core because core is, is actually a better indicator of headline and of all inflation going forward.  So we’ll be—we’ll be looking at both.  And we’ll be looking at them for—at those both, really—for what they’re saying about the outlook rather than just simply for, for what they say.  But we’ll be asking:  Do we see inflationary pressures declining?  Do we see actual readings of inflation coming down?  So, in light of all that data, the question we’ll be asking is whether the stance of policy we have is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent target.  And it’s also worth noting that these rate hikes have been large, and they’ve come—they’ve come quickly.  And it’s likely that their full effect has not been felt by the economy.  So there’s probably some additional tightening, significant additional tightening, in the pipeline.  So where are we going with this?  I think the best—I think the Committee broadly feels that we need to get policy to at least to a moderately restrictive level.  And maybe the best data point for that would be what we wrote down in our SEP at the—at the June meeting.  So I think the median [federal funds rate] for the end of this year, the median would’ve been between 3¼ and 3½ [percent].  And, then, people wrote down 50 basis points higher than that for 2023.  So that’s—even though that’s now six weeks old, I guess, that’s—that’s the most recent reading.  Of course, we’ll update that reading at the—at the September meeting in eight weeks.  So that’s how we’re thinking about it.  As I mentioned, as it relates to September, I said that another unusually large increase could be appropriate, but that’s not a decision we’re making now.  It’s one that we’ll make based  July 27, 2022  on the data we see.  And we’re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting.  We think   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL it’s—we think it’s time to just go to a meeting-by-meeting basis and not provide, you know, the kind of clear guidance that we had provided on the way to neutral.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick.

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, you’ve said that your policy works through influencing expectations and that policy needs to be at least moderately restrictive, which means you need financial conditions to stay tight.  Futures market pricing currently implies you will raise rates this year along the lines of your June SEP but then lower them a few months later next year.  Are these expectations consistent with the need to keep financial conditions tight in order to moderate purchasing power and bring inflation back to 2 percent? uncertainty.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I’m going to start by pointing out that it’s very hard to say with any confidence in normal times—in normal times—what the economy’s going to be doing in 6 or 12 months.  And to try to predict what the appropriate monetary policy would respond—response would be—of course, we do that in the SEP, but, nonetheless, you’ve got to take any estimates of what rates will be next year with a grain of salt, because there’s so much These are not normal times.  There’s significantly more uncertainty now about the path ahead than I think there ordinarily is, and, ordinarily, it’s quite high.  So, again, I would—the best data, the only data point I have for you really is the June SEP, which I think is just the most recent thing that the Committee’s done.  Since then, inflation has come in higher; economic activity has come in weaker than expected.    July 27, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL But at the same time, I would say that’s probably the best estimate of where the Committee’s thinking is still, which is that we would get to a moderately restrictive level by the end of this year—by which I mean somewhere between 3 and 3½ percent—and that when the Committee sees further rate increases in 2023, as I mentioned, we’ll update that, of course, at the 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  You said inflation had been a little bit hotter than anticipated.  Has your view of the terminal rate changed since June?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I wouldn’t say it was—I think we didn’t expect a good reading, but this one—this one was even worse than expected, I would say.  I don’t talk about my own personal estimate of, of what the terminal rate would be.  I do—I will write down that in—it’s going to evolve.  Obviously, it has evolved over the course—I think, for all participants, it has evolved over the course of the year as we learn how persistent inflation’s going to be.  And by the time of the September meeting, we will have seen two more CPI readings and two more labor market readings and a significant amount of readings about economic activity and perhaps geopolitical developments, who knows.  It’ll be—it’ll be a lot.  It’s an eight-week intermeeting period, so I think we’ll see quite a lot of data.  And we’ll make our decision at that meeting based on that data.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.  You kind of alluded to this earlier, but I wonder in the event that you see several months of very weak headline inflation numbers because oil prices are coming down so much, but core inflation continues to be strong or even picks up, I wonder how you would think about that.  July 27, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So it’s hard to deal with hypotheticals, but I just would say this.  We, you know, we would look at both, and we would ask—we’d be asking ourselves, are we confident that inflation is on a path down to 2 percent?  That’s really the question.  And we’ll be making—you know, our policy stance will be set at a level, ultimately, at which we are confident that inflation is going to be moving down to 2 percent.  So you would—it would depend on a lot of things.  Of course, as I mentioned, core inflation is a better predictor of inflation going forward.  Headline inflation tends to be volatile.  So, in ordinary times, you, you look through volatile moves in commodities.  The problem with the current situation is that, that if you have a sustained period of supply shocks, those can actually start to undermine or to work—to work on de-anchoring inflation expectations.  The public doesn’t distinguish between core and headline inflation in their thinking.  So it’s something we have to take into consideration in our policymaking even though our tools don’t really work on, on some aspects of this, which are the supply-side issues.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman.  Earlier this week, the President said, “We are not going to be in a recession.” So I have two questions off of that.  Do you share the President’s confidence in not being in a recession?  And, second, how would or would not a recession change policy?  Is it a bright line, sir, where, where contraction of the economy would be a turning point in policy?  Or is there some amount of contraction of the economy the Committee would be willing to abide in its effort to reduce inflation?   July 27, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, as I—as I mentioned, we think it’s necessary to have growth slow down.  And growth is going to be slowing down this year for a couple of reasons, one of which is that you’re coming off of the very high growth of the reopening year of 2021.  You’re also seeing tighter monetary policy.  And you should see some slowing.  We actually think we need a period of growth below potential in order to create some slack so that—so that the supply side can catch up.  We also think that there will be, in all likelihood, some softening in labor market conditions.  And those are things that we expect.  And we think that they’re probably necessary if we were to have—to get inflation—if we were to be able to get inflation back down on a path to 2 percent and ultimately get there. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  The question was whether you see a recession coming and how that might or might not change policy.  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we’re going to be—again, we’re going to be focused on getting inflation back down.  And we—as I’ve said on other occasions, price stability is really the bedrock of the economy.  And nothing works in the economy without price stability.  We can’t have a strong labor market without price stability for an extended period of time.  We all want to get back to the kind of labor market we had before the pandemic, where differences between, you know, racial and gender differences and that kind of thing were at historic minimums, where participation was high, where inflation was low.  We want to get back to that, but that’s not happening.  That’s not going to happen without, without restoring price stability.  So that’s something we see as, as something that we simply must do.  And we think that in the—we don’t see it as a tradeoff with, with the employment mandate.  We see it as a way to facilitate the sustained achievement of the employment mandate in the longer term.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard.  July 27, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Particularly in regard to expectations, it’s been said the last few months that the risks of doing too little outweighed the lists—the risks of doing too much.  Does that remain the bias?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we’re trying to do just the right amount, right?  We’re not—we’re not trying to have a recession.  And we don’t think we have to.  We think that there’s a path for us to be able to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor market, as I mentioned, along with—in all likelihood—some, some softening in labor market conditions.  So that is—that’s what we’re trying to achieve, and we continue to think that there’s a path to that.  We know that the path has, has clearly narrowed, really based on events that are outside of our control.  And it may narrow further.  So, you know, I do think—as I said just now—that restoring price stability is just something that we have to do.  There, there isn’t an option to fail to do that because that is the thing that enables you to have a strong labor market over time.  Without restoring price stability, you won’t be able, over the medium and longer term, to actually have a strong—a sustained period of very strong labor market conditions.  So, of course, we serve both sides of the dual mandate, but we actually see them as well aligned on this. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  But as a—as a follow-on to that, given the uncertainty and that sort of paradoxical flow of data you’ve been getting, if you’re going to make a mistake, would you rather make the mistake on doing too much, raising too much, than raising too little?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  We’re trying not to make a mistake.  Let me put it this way:  We do see that there are two-sided risks.  There would be the risk of doing too much and, you know, imposing more of a downturn on the economy than, than was necessary, but the risk—the risk of doing too little and leaving the economy with this entrenched inflation, it only raises the cost.  If  July 27, 2022  you fail to deal with it in the near term, it only raises the cost of, of dealing with it later to the   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL extent people start to see it as just part of their economic lives.   They start to factor high inflation into their decisions—when that—on a sustained basis.  When that starts to really happen, and we don’t think that’s happened yet, but when that starts to happen, it just gets that much harder.  And the pain will be that much greater.  So I really do think that it’s important that we—that we address this now and get it done.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Neil.  

[SECTION]

NEIL IRWIN.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin from Axios.  To build a little bit on what Steve was asking, do you believe the United States is currently in a recession?  Will the GDP reading tomorrow affect that judgment one way or the other?  And has your assessment of the risk of recession changed any in recent weeks?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I don’t—I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession.  And the reason is, there are just too many areas of the economy that are—that are performing, you know, too well.  And, of course, I would point to the labor market, in particular.  As I mentioned, it’s true that growth is slowing for reasons that we understand.  Really, the growth was extraordinarily high last year, 5½ percent.  We would have expected growth to slow.  There’s also more slowing going on now.  But if you look at the labor market, you’ve got growth—I think, payroll jobs averaging 450,000 per month.  That’s a remarkably strong level for, for this state of, of affairs.  The unemployment rate at near a 50-year low at 3.6 percent.  All of the wage measures that we track are running very strong.  So this is a very strong labor market, and it’s just not consistent with—you know, 2.7 million people hired in the first half of the year.  It doesn’t make sense that the  July 27, 2022  economy would be in recession with, with this kind of thing happening.  So I don’t think the U.S.   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   economy’s in recession right now.  

[SECTION]

NEIL IRWIN.  GDP?  GDP tomorrow? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Ah, haven’t seen it, and, and we’ll just have to see what it says.  I don’t—I mean, I would say, generally, the GDP numbers do have a tendency to be revised pretty significantly.  It’s just—it’s just that it’s very hard—it’s very hard to cumulate [to an estimate of] U.S. GDP.  It’s a large economy.  And a lot of—a lot of work and judgment goes into that.  But you tend to take first GDP reports, I think, with a—with a grain of salt.  But, of course, it’s something we’ll be looking at.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria.  

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  I wanted to ask about the new conflict-of-interest rules that you all rolled out.  Some senators have written asking for those rules to have more teeth and to have sort of more transparency about Fed’s financial—the Fed officials’ financial activity.  I was wondering if you could speak to that and whether you intend on, you know, toughening those rules in any way.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So those are—those are the toughest rules in place, you know, at any comparable institution that I’m aware of.  We think—you know, we’ve thought about this carefully, and we put them in place.  And we’re building the infrastructure so that—so that, you know, the enforcement will be tight, that, actually, you won’t be able to make trades unless they’re precleared.  And the amount of trades you make, they’ll have to be 45 days or more before any FOMC meeting.  It’s just—I think we’ve really, you know, created a very strong and robust set of rules that will, you know, support public trust in the institution.  And, again, we’re just now—the system is just now up and running.  And I’m proud of what we did.   July 27, 2022

MICHELLE SMITH.  Catarina.    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CATARINA SARAIVA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Hi.  Catarina Saraiva, Bloomberg News.  I wanted to ask a little bit more about the 75 basis points versus 50 versus 25.  Can you talk a little bit about what, what kind of goes into your thinking for, you know, making the decision on how much to raise rates and, you know, just talking about a very large amount that you alluded to?  Could that possibly be 100 basis points?  And then, kind of along those lines, is there any sort of weakness in the economy, outside of inflation measures, that would lead you to slow your hiking pace? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I’m going to—I’m going to take that as a question about the next meeting and thereafter.  So, as I mentioned, we’re going to be looking at all of those things:  activity, labor market, inflation.  And we’re going to be thinking about our policy stance and where does it really need to be.  And I also mentioned that, as this process—now that we’re at neutral—as the process goes on, at some point, it will be appropriate to, to slow down.  And we haven’t made a decision when that point is, but intuitively that makes sense, right?  We’ve been front-end-loading these very large rate increases, and now we’re getting closer to where we need to be.  So that’s how we’re thinking about it.  And in terms of September, we’re going—we’re going to watch the data and the evolving outlook very carefully and factor in everything and make a decision in September about what to do.  And I’m not really going to provide any specific guidance about what that might be.  So, you know, but I mentioned that we might do another unusually large rate increase.  But that’s not a So we are—you know, we’re going to be guided by the data.  And I think you can still think of the, the destination as broadly in line with the September—sorry, the June SEP, because  July 27, 2022  it’s only six weeks old.  And sometimes, sometimes SEPs can get old really quick.  I think in this   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   one—this one I would say is probably, probably the best guide we have as to where the Committee thinks it needs to get at the end of the year and then into next year.  So I would point you to that.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris.  

[SECTION]

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.  I wanted to ask about right now, there’s a sort of growing gap between the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the PCE, PCE index, and the one that’s followed by the public, the CPI, of course.  How do you expect to handle this divergence if the PCE starts to come down enough for you to consider slowing rate hikes, even if the public is still seeing much higher CPI ratings?  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So it’s an interesting, interesting situation.  Of course, we’ve, we’ve long used PCE because we think it’s just better at capturing the inflation that people actually face in their lives.  And I think that that view is pretty widely understood.  That said, the public really reads about CPI.  And the difference really is because the CPI has higher weights on things like food, gasoline, motor vehicles, and housing than the PCE index does.  And so that accounts for a lot of the difference.  However, over time, they tend to come together.  You know, we—given the importance in the public eye of CPI, we are calling it out and noticing it and everything like that.  But remember, we do target PCE.  That is because we think it’s a better measure.  They will come together eventually.  The typical gap was really about 25 basis points for a very long time.  And if it went—if it got to 40 basis points, that would be very noticeable.  And now it’s—now it’s much larger than that because of the things I  July 27, 2022  mentioned.  So we’ll be watching both, but, again, the one that we think is the best measure   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL always has been PCE, at least since I think we—some 20 plus years ago—moved to PCE.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Michael McKee. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  I’d like to weave a couple of things together, Mr. Chairman.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg TV and Radio.  You said that the destination pretty much remains the same in terms of your end-of-the-year target.  But where are you in the journey?  We’ve now seen the federal stimulus programs end.  You mentioned consumer spending, business investment have slowed.  Are they moving at a pace you would expect?  Or is demand still greater than supply—too much greater than supply that you need to do significantly more?  And I ask because there are lags in the impact of monetary policy, as you mentioned.  And a lot of this might hit in 2023.  The strong dollar effect may hit in 2023, when the economy might be weak.  How, how do you know where you are and where you think you need to get to?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, just talking about demand for a second:   As I mentioned in my remarks, I think you pretty clearly do see a slowing now in demand in the second quarter—consumer spending, business fixed investment, housing, places like that.  I think, you know, people widely looked at the first-quarter numbers and thought they didn’t make sense and might have been misleading in terms of the overall direction of the economy—[that was] not, not true of the second quarter.  But at the same time, you have this labor market.  So there are plenty of experiences where GDP has been reported as weak and the labor happened many times.  And it used to happen—if you remember, in the first quarter of every year, for several years in a row, GDP was negative, and the labor market was moving on just  July 27, 2022  fine.  And it turned out to just be measurement error.  It was called residual seasonality.  We   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL don’t know the situation. The truth is, though, we, we think that demand is moderating.  We do.  How much is it moderating?  We’re not sure.  We’re going to have to watch the data carefully.  There are—there is a great deal of money on people’s balance sheets that they can spend.  The unemployment rate is very low.  The labor market’s very hot.  There are many, many job openings.  Wages are high.  So it’s the kind of thing where you think that the—that the economy should actually be, be doing pretty well in the second half of the year.  But we’ll have to see.  We don’t know that because you do see a marked slowing in the second quarter that does—that is fairly broad.  So we’ll be watching that.  We’ll be watching that.  Of course, as I mentioned, we do want to see demand running below potential for a sustained period to create slack and, and give inflation a chance to come down.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Nicole. 

[SECTION]

NICOLE GOODKIND.  Hi, thank you, Chairman.  Nicole Goodkind, CNN Business.  When does the Committee expect to see a meaningful slowdown in the labor market?  And how much weakness will it accept with regard to slower job growth and higher unemployment before it pauses or begins to think about cutting rates?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I think you’re already seeing—you’ve seen, in the labor market, what you’ve seen is a decline from very high levels of job creation last year and earlier this year to modestly slower job creation—still, still quite robust, as I mentioned.  So you’re seeing that.  You’re seeing some increase—some increase in initial claims from insurance, although that may actually have to do with seasonal adjustments.  We’re not sure that that’s actually real.   July 27, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL There’s some evidence that wages—if you look at average hourly earnings, they appear to be moderating, not so yet from the other wage measures.  And we’ll be getting the employment compensation index measurement, I think, on Friday, I guess.  And that’s a very important one because it adjusts for compensation—composition.  So I’d say you—and also, anecdotally, you hear much—the sort of level of concern on the part of businesses that they simply can’t find workers is probably down a little bit from what it was, say, for example, late in the latter parts of last year.  So there’s a feeling that the labor them moving sideways or perhaps a little bit down.  But it’s only the beginning of an adjustment.   But I think most—also, if you look at—I mean, once you start citing these things, you can’t stop.  If you look at the household survey, you see much lower job creation, and the household survey can be quite volatile, but it has no jobs created in the last three months.  So that might be a signal that job creation’s actually a little bit slower than we’re seeing in the—in the establishment survey.  So executive summary [is]:  I would say there’s some evidence that labor demand may be slowing a bit—labor supply, not so much.  We have been disappointed that labor force participation really hasn’t moved up since January.  That may be related to yet another big wave of COVID.  And there’s evidence that that’s the case.  But—So we’re not seeing much in the way of labor supply.  Nonetheless, I would say some, some progress on demand and supply getting back in alignment. before you think about pausing rate cuts? 

[SECTION]

NICOLE GOODKIND.  And then how much weakness would you be willing to accept 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I think we’re looking—we’re going to be looking at, at inflation as well.  You know, as I mentioned, we need to see inflation coming down.  We need to be  July 27, 2022  confident that inflation is going to get back down to mandate-consistent levels.  That’s not   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL something we can avoid doing.  That really needs to happen.  And, but we do think, though, that the labor market can adjust because of the huge overhang of job openings, of excess demand, really.  There should be able to be an adjustment that would have lower than—perhaps lower-than-expected increases in unemployment—lower than would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level—the ratio of, of vacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience.  And that suggests that this time could be different.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward Lawrence. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.  So you said that the path may be narrowed to avoiding a recession.  So how, how close are we to a recession?  And then how do forecasts of possible recession from banks and economists, how does that make a soft landing you’ve talked about more difficult?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So as, as I mentioned, it doesn’t seem that the U.S. economy is in recession right now.  And I think you do see weakening, some slowdown—let’s put it that way—in growth.  And you see it across some of the categories that I mentioned.  But there’s also just the very strong data coming out of the labor market, still.  So, overall, you would say that, in all probability, demand is still strong, and, and the economy is still on track to continue to grow this year.  But the slowdown in the second quarter is notable.  And we’re—you know, we’re going to be watching that carefully.  Sorry, what was the—  

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Forecasts.  You know, how do bank forecasts of possible recessions, economists, does that affect the soft landing?   July 27, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, you know, we’ve said since the beginning, I think, that, that having a soft landing is what we’re aiming for.  Of course, that has to be our goal.  It is our goal.  And we’ll keep trying to achieve it.  I think—I do think events—at the beginning, we said it was not going to be easy.  It was going to be quite challenging to do that.  It’s unusual.  It’s an unusual event.  It’s not a typical event, given where we are.  If there is a path to it, and we think there is, it is the one I mentioned, that the labor see that demand coming down in a way that didn’t translate into a big increase in unemployment as you would expect in the ordinary course because, frankly, the imbalance is so much greater.  And, but we don’t know that.  I mean, this is a—this is a case of first impression.  So anyone who is really sure that it’s impossible or really sure that it will happen is probably underestimating the level of uncertainty.  And so I would certainly say it’s an uncertain, uncertain thing.  Nonetheless, it’s our goal to achieve it, and we’ll keep trying to do that.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Jean. 

[SECTION]

JEAN YUNG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Jean Yung with Market News.  I wanted to ask about the balance sheet reduction program.  It’s been working for a couple months now and in a different environment than the last time the Fed did it.  What are you learning about how it’s working and how markets are reacting?  And is reaching the minimum level of reserves needed in the system still several years away at the current pace?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we think it’s working fine.  As you know, we, we tapered up into it.  And, and in September, we’ll go to full strength.  And the markets seem to have accepted it.  By all assessments, the markets should be able to absorb this.  And we expect that’ll be the case.   July 27, 2022  So I would say the plan is broadly on track.  It’s a little bit slow to get going because some of   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL these trades don’t settle until—for a bit of time.  But it’ll be picking up steam.  So I guess your second question was getting—the process of getting back down to the new equilibrium will take a while.  And that time, it’s hard to be precise, but, you know, the model would suggest that it could be between two, two and a half years, that kind of thing.  And this is a much faster pace than the last time.  Balance sheet’s much, much bigger than it was.  But we looked at this carefully, and we thought that this, this was the sensible pace.  And we have no reason to think it’s not.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Brian. 

[SECTION]

BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance.  Looking at financial conditions, it seems like the tightening has slowed as of late with the 10 year coming down, 30-year fixed mortgage rates also going a bit sideways, when we talk about a hot housing continue to raise rates.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So a big piece of that is inflation expectations—you know, breakevens coming down, which, you know, is a good thing.  It’s a good thing that markets do seem to have confidence in, in the Committee’s commitment to getting inflation back down to 2 percent.  So we like to see market-based, you know, readings of inflation expectations come down.  You know, broader financial conditions have tightened, tightened a good bit.  I mean, the way this works is we, we set our policy, and financial conditions react, and then financial conditions are what affects the economy.  And we don’t control that second step.  We’re just going to do what we think needs to be done.  We’re going to—we’re going to get our policy rate to a level where we’re confident that  July 27, 2022  inflation will be moving back down to 2 percent.  Confident.  So that’s how we’re going to take   Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL   it.  And, of course, we’ll be watching financial conditions to see that they are appropriately tight and that they’re having the effect that we would hope they’re having, which is to see demand moderate and inflationary pressures recede and, ultimately, inflation come down.

GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  I wonder if you can go back a little bit in time to before there was this outbreak of inflation, when the Committee put in place forward guidance on tapering asset purchases.  I think it was December 2020.  There’s a recent speech by Fed Governor Waller talking about that and saying that maybe that was too tight, that kind of condition, and it put you a little bit behind—not his words but that decision, and have you looked at it in hindsight at all?  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, yes, we said that we wouldn’t lift off until we had basically achieved our dual-mandate goals.  And the reason we did it in real time was that, the first look at the new framework that we’d rolled out, plenty of people were saying, “It’s not credible.  You’ll never get inflation to 2 percent.”  Some of our critics now who say inflation’s too tight—too high were the same ones who were saying, “You’ll never get to 2 percent.”  Well, but anyway, that’s what happened.  So we, we thought we needed to really make a strong statement with that.  It wasn’t part of the framework.  The December ’20 guidance was not part of our overall new framework.  It was just guidance that we put in place.  So I would say two things.  One, I don’t think that that has materially changed the situation.  But I have to admit, I don’t think I would do that again.  I don’t think I would do that again.  We—you know, ultimately, the situation evolved in a highly  July 27, 2022  unexpected way for all of us.  And, you know, maybe the learning is that leave a little more   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL flexibility than that.  But did it matter in the end?  You know, we—if you look at—I really don’t think it did.  I’m not sure it would’ve mattered if we’d been raising rates three months earlier.  Does anybody think that would’ve made a big difference?  I mean, lots of central banks were raising rates three months earlier, and it didn’t matter.  I mean, this is a—this is a global phenomenon that’s happening now—admittedly, different in the United States, but anyway.

GREG ROBB.  Can I follow up? 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Sorry about that, Greg. 

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Just a lot of people talk about that time, and they talk about a taper tantrum.  I know you haven’t talked about it too much but that you were worried at the time about repeating that taper tantrum that you had experienced as a Governor.  So was that part of that?  Where did that fit into all those decisions?  Thank you.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I think we learned—there’ve been multiple taper tantrums, right?  So there was the famous one in 2013.  There’s what happened at the December ’18 meeting, where, you know, markets can ignore developments around the balance sheet for years on end and then suddenly react very sharply.  So we just had developed a practice of moving predictably and doing it in steps and things like that.  It was just like that’s how we did it.  And so we did it that way this time.  We were—we were careful to, to take steps and communicate and all that kind of thing.  Yes, we were trying to avoid a tantrum because they can be quite destructive.  They can tighten financial conditions and knock the economy off kilter.  And, you know, when it happens, you have to—really, in both ’13 and ’18, it really had consequences for the real  July 27, 2022  economy, you know, two, three, four months later.  So we were trying to avoid that.  That was   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL part of it.  Again, I don’t think that’s—the real issue of 2020 and ’21 was just trying to understand what was happening with the reopening economy.  That, that was where the big uncertainty was.  And, you know, our view was that these supply-side issues would get better:  that people would go back to work, that labor force participation would come back, everyone would get vaccinated, schools would open, kids would be in school, and labor force participation would jump back up.  That’s what we were—that was very broadly thought to be the case:  these supply-side issues would get solved reasonably quickly.  And they just haven’t.  They still haven’t.  So that’s really the learning, I think, is around how complicated these supply-side issues can be.  We haven’t seen this before in a long, long time.  And so that’s really, you know, what accounts for the pace at which we moved, and we did.  When inflation changed direction, really, in October, we’ve moved quickly since then.  I think people would agree.  But before then, inflation was coming down month by month.  And, you know, we kind of thought we had the story—probably had the story right.  But then, I think in October, you started to see a range of data that said “No.  This is a much stronger economy and much higher inflation than we’ve been thinking.”  And, again, we’ve pivoted, and here we are.

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, I just want to pin you down a little bit more on the issue of recession.  So if we get a negative GDP number tomorrow for the second quarter, would the Fed consider the U.S. in a recession?  And just remind us, what is your definition for the start of a recession?  July 27, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So the Fed doesn’t make a—doesn’t make a judgment on that.  You know, we’re focused on the dual mandate and using our tools to achieve maximum employment and price stability.  We don’t—we don’t say “There is now a recession” and that kind of thing.  So that wouldn’t be something we’d do.  We would look at the data tomorrow—and no doubt, we’ll look at it very carefully—and draw whatever implications we can.  As I mentioned, though, you know, if you think about what an inflation—sorry, what a recession really is, it’s a broad-based decline across many industries that, you know, is sustained for more than a couple of months, and there are a bunch of specific tests in it.  And it just doesn’t—this just doesn’t seem like that now.  What we have right now doesn’t seem like that.  And the real reason is that the labor market is just sending such a signal of economic strength that it makes you really question the GDP data.  But, again, that’s not a decision that we—that we make.  And we won’t—we won’t reach a conclusion one way or another on that.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Simon. 

[SECTION]

SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Thank you very much.  Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.  You said that some softening in the labor market is needed.  Within the Fed, there are staff economists who’ve argued that NAIRU, the noninflationary rate of unemployment, might be as high as 5 to 6 percent right now, which obviously is a lot higher than the current rate of 3.6.  What’s your assessment of NAIRU?  Is that something that came up in discussion with the Committee? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I think, broadly, a lot of economists think that the—that the natural rate of unemployment will have moved up to some significant extent above where we think it was before.  And the reason is there’s—it’s the usual matching issue, where matching has become less effective, and that kind of thing when you have the kind of turbulent downturn and  July 27, 2022  the big switches in demand from services to goods and all that.  So it could be higher.  And my   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL own instinct is that the natural rate of unemployment is higher.  Of course, I would add that we don’t know it.  We can never know where these star variables are in real time with any confidence.  But I would say it must have moved up materially.  But the other side of that is, as all these jobs get created and people go back to work and unemployment is so low, I think you could, in principle, you could see it coming back down pretty significantly.  And that would also, by the way, take pressure off of inflation because it’s that gap—it’s the gap between actual unemployment and the—and the natural rate that really is relevant for, you know, the negative slack we have in the economy with the overtight labor actually be seeing inflationary pressures coming down if that does happen.  And we don’t—we don’t control that.  But that’s something that, logically, if the pandemic and the disorder in the labor market caused the natural rate to move up, then as the labor market settles down, in principle, you should see it move back down.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeff. 

[SECTION]

JEFF COX.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.  Just a question about—hate to keep banging the drum about recession.  But most of the polls that we’re seeing now from the public, people believe that we’re already in a recession or heading for one—economists, pretty much the same thing.  They’re being told by folks like you and the Administration that we’re not in a recession, we’re not heading for a recession—frankly, coming from the same people who told them inflation was transitory, telling them now that we’re not heading for a recession.  So what would you tell the public to reassure them now that you feel  July 27, 2022  confident in your forecast going forward and the Fed is ready to respond to a—to a potential   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL downturn in the economy?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  No, all I’ve really said is I don’t think it’s likely that the U.S. economy’s in a recession now.  And I’ve explained why that is the case.  It’s, it’s because you do see a very strong labor market.  And I think the public will see that as well.  You know, going forward, what we’ve seen is a—is a slowing in spending, as I mentioned.  We’ve seen the very beginnings of perhaps a slight lessening in the—in the tightness of the labor market, but it would only be the beginnings.  So, and I mentioned that, that—I also said that our goal is to bring inflation down and have a so-called soft landing, by which I mean a landing that doesn’t require a significant increase, a really significant increase in unemployment.  We’re trying to achieve that.  I have said, on many occasions, that we understand that’s going to be quite challenging and that it’s got more challenging over recent months.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Kyle.  

[SECTION]

KYLE CAMPBELL.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Kyle Campbell with American Banker.  The FOMC has historically tried to avoid the kind of rapid monetary policy tightening that has happened so far this year.  How concerned are you that the rate hikes that we’ve seen thus far might increase risks to financial stability not just domestically, but globally?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I mean, there are precedents for the FOMC moving very quickly—for example, in 1994, and in 1980, even more so.  So we’ve been known to do that when it’s the appropriate thing to do.  And this year, it clearly is.  I would say that, given how quickly we’ve moved, I’m gratified that while—that, basically, markets have been working.  They’ve been orderly.  There’s been some volatility, but that’s only to be expected.   July 27, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL For a financial stability perspective, you know, asset values are down, which in some—in some sense lowers vulnerabilities.  It’s when they’re really high that you would worry that they’re—that they’re vulnerable to a fall, actually.  Many asset values have come down.  I think you’ve got a well-capitalized banking system.  I think you have—households are generally in about as strong as financial shape as they’ve been in a very long time or perhaps ever given the money that’s on people’s balance sheets.  So you have a pretty—from a financial stability standpoint, you have a pretty decent picture.  Now, the macroeconomic, there are plenty of macroeconomic issues that don’t rise to the level of financial stability concerns.  By financial stability, you know, we think of that as things that might undermine the working of the financial system, so big, serious things.  That’s not to say that people at the lower end of the income spectrum aren’t, aren’t suffering, because they are.  They’re suffering from high inflation.  They’re going to the—to the grocery store and finding that, in many cases, their paycheck doesn’t cover the food they’re accustomed to buying.  We’re seeing actual, you know, real declines in food consumption.  And, you know, it’s very concerning.  It’s very unfortunate.  And that’s why we’re—we’re really committed to bringing down inflation—one of the reasons.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Mark for the last question.  remember when you held your first news conference, and you vowed to be a very plainspoken Chairman, and we’re thinking today about the impacts of Fed policy on individuals as well.  What would you say to individuals or households who may yet lose their jobs in this tightening cycle in the fight against inflation as they try to translate what Fed policy means to them in this complicated economic landscape?  Thank you.   July 27, 2022     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess the first thing I would say to, to every household is that we know that inflation is too high.  We understand how painful it is, particularly for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and spend most of that paycheck on necessities, such as food and gas and heating their homes and clothing and things like that.  We do understand that, that those people suffer the most.  Middle-class and better-off people have some resources, where they can absorb these things.  But people, many people, don’t have those resources.  So, you know, we—it is our job.  It is our institutional role.  We are assigned uniquely and unconditionally the obligation of, of providing price stability to the American people.  And we’re going to use our tools to do that.  As I mentioned, there will be some, in all likelihood, some softening in labor market conditions.  We need growth to slow to below potential growth.  We don’t want to—we don’t want this to be bigger than it needs to be.  But, ultimately, if you think about the medium and longer term, price stability is the thing that, that makes the whole economy work.  It’s what can—it can give us a strong labor market and wages that aren’t being eaten up by high inflation.  If you talk to people—again, people who are making, you know, wages, relatively low wages—they’re the ones who are suffering the most from inflation.  So it’s all the more reason why we need to move, move on this.  Thank you very much.   ",other,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
53,2022-09-21,"CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.  We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.  Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.  Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.  In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ percentage point, and we anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate.  We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent.  In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.  I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy has slowed from the historically high growth rates of 2021, which reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recession.  Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production.  Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year’s rapid pace, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions.  Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly, in large part reflecting higher mortgage rates.  Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment, while weaker economic growth abroad is restraining exports.  As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, since June, FOMC participants have marked down their projections for economic activity, with the median projection for real  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL GDP growth standing at just 0.2 percent this year and 1.2 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate. Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth elevated.  Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 378,000 jobs per month over the last three months.  The labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers.  The labor force participation rate showed a welcome uptick in August but is little changed since the beginning of the year.  FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing the upward pressure on wages and prices.  The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to 4.4 percent at the end of next year, ½ percentage point higher than in the June projections.  Over the next three years, the median unemployment rate runs above the median estimate of its longer-run normal level. Inflation remains well above our 2 percent longer-run goal.  Over the 12 months ending in July, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent.  In August, the 12-month change in the consumer price index was 8.3 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6.3 percent.  Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services.  Although gasoline prices have turned down in recent months, they remain well above year-earlier levels, in part reflecting Russia’s war against Ukraine, which has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional upward pressure on inflation.  The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 5.4 percent this year and falls to 2.8 percent next year, 2.3 percent in 2024, and 2 percent in 2025.  Participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside.  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets.  But that is not grounds for complacency; the longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched. The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¾ percentage point, bringing the target range to 3 to 3¼ percent.  And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent.  We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate; the pace of those increases will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.  With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 3 percentage points this year.  At some point, as the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL inflation.  We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time.  The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.  As shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 4.4 percent at the end of this year, 1 percentage point higher than projected in June.  The median projection rises to 4.6 percent at the end of next year and declines to 2.9 percent by the end of 2025, still above the median estimate of its longer-run value.  Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply.  Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.  Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth, and there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions.  Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.  We will keep at it until we are confident the job is done. To conclude:  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. 

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you for taking our questions.  Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.  I wonder if you could give us a little detail around how  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL you’ll know when to slow down these rate increases and how you’ll eventually know when to stop. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I will answer—I will answer your question directly, but I want to start here today by saying that my main message has not changed at all since Jackson Hole.  The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2 percent, and we will keep at it until the job is done.  So the way we’re thinking about this is, the overarching focus of the Committee is getting inflation back down to 2 percent.  To accomplish that, we think we’ll need to do two things, in particular:  to achieve a period of growth below trend; and also some softening in labor So on the first, the Committee’s forecasts and those of most outside forecasters do show growth running below its longer-run potential this year and next year.  On the second, though, so far there’s only modest evidence that the labor market is cooling off.  Job openings are down a bit, as you know; quits are off their all-time highs; there’s some signs that some wage measures light of the high inflation we’re seeing, we think we’ll need to—and in light of what I just said, we think that we’ll need to bring our funds rate to a restrictive level and to keep it there for some time. So, what will we be looking at, I guess, is your question.  So we’ll be looking at a few things.  First, we’ll want to see growth continuing to run below trend, we’ll want to see movements in the labor market showing a return to a better balance between supply and demand, and, ultimately, we’ll want to see clear evidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent.  So that’s what we’ll be looking for.  In terms of reducing rates, I think we’d want to be very confident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent before we would consider that.  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL

MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve. 

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Can you talk about how you factor in the variable lags on inflation and the extent to which the outlook for rates should be seen as linear in the sense that you keep raising rates?  Well, can you envision a time when there’s a pause to kind of look at what has been wrought in the economy from the rate increases?  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So, of course, monetary policy does, famously, work with long and variable lags.  The way I think of it is, our policy decisions affect financial conditions immediately.  In fact, financial conditions have usually been affected well before we actually announce our decisions.  Then, changes in financial conditions begin to affect economic activity fairly quickly, within a few months.  But it’s likely to take some time to see the full effects of changing financial conditions on inflation.  So we are very much mindful for that.  And that’s why I noted in my opening remarks that, at some point, as the stance of policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation.  So that’s how we think about that. Your second question—sorry—was?  

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Is there a point in time you could see pausing?  Is it linear?  Do you keep raising rates, or is there—oh, sorry, I should know better than to not talk with a microphone. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I should know better than to answer your second question.  

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Well, there you go.  Is it linear?  Do you keep raising rates, or is there a pause that you could envision where you kind of figure out what has happened to the  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL economy and give time to catch up in the real economy—the rate increase time to catch up in the real economy?  Thank you.   

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I think it’s very hard to say with precise certainty the way this is going to unfold.  As I mentioned, what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level that’s restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent, where we have confidence of that.  And what you see in the SEP numbers is people’s views as of today, as of this meeting, as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate. Now, those will evolve over time, and I think we’ll just have to see how that goes.  There is a possibility, certainly, that we would go to a certain level that we’re confident in and stay there for a time.  But we’re not at that level.  Clearly, today we’re, we’ve just moved, I think, probably, into the very lowest level of what might be restrictive, and, certainly, in my view and the view of the Committee, there’s a ways to go. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Rachel. 

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.  Thank you for taking our questions.  The projections show the unemployment rate rising to 4.4 percent next year, and, historically, that kind of rise in the unemployment rate would typically bring a recession with it.  Should we interpret that to mean no soft landing, and is that kind of rise necessary to get inflation down?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So you’re right—in the SEP, there’s what I would characterize as a relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate from a historical perspective, given the expected decline in inflation.  Now, why is that?  So, really, that is what we generally expect because we see the current situation as outside of historical experience in a number of ways, and I’ll mention a couple of those.  First—and you know these—but first, job  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL openings are incredibly high relative to the number of people looking for work.  It’s plausible, I’ll say, that job openings could come down significantly—and they need to—without as much of an increase in unemployment as has happened in earlier historical episodes.  So that’s one thing. In addition, in this cycle, longer-run inflation expectations have generally been fairly well anchored, and, as I’ve said, there’s no basis for complacency there.  But to the extent that continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability.  And I guess the third thing I would point to that’s different this time is that part of this inflation is caused by this series of supply shocks that we’ve had, beginning with the pandemic, and, really, with the reopening of the economy, and more recently amplified and added to by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—have all contributed to the sharp increase in inflation. So these are the kinds of events that are not really seen in prior business cycles, and, in principle, if those things start to get better—and we do see some evidence of the beginnings of that.  It’s not much more than that, but it’s good to see that.  For example, commodity prices look like they may have peaked for now; supply chain disruptions are beginning to resolve.  Those developments, if sustained, could help ease the pressures on inflation. So let me just say, how much these factors will turn out to really matter in this sequence of events—it remains to be seen.  We have always understood that restoring price stability while achieving a relatively modest decline—or, rather, increase—in unemployment and a soft landing would be very challenging.  And we don’t know—no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or, if so, how significant that recession would be.  That’s going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether expectations remain anchored, and whether, also, do we get more labor supply, which would help as well.  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL In addition, the chances of a soft landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy needs to be more restrictive or restrictive for longer.  Nonetheless, we’re committed to getting inflation back down to 2 percent—because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain later on. 

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Just to follow up on one small thing—are vacancies still at the top of your list in terms of understanding the labor market and how much room there is there?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, vacancies are still almost a 2-to-1 ratio to unemployed people.  That and quits are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how different it is from other cycles, where, generally, the unemployment rate itself is the single best indicator.  We think those things have, for quite a time now, really added value in terms of understanding where the labor market is.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick. 

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  You said not too long ago, in describing the policy destination, there’s still a way to go.  But I imagine you have to have some idea about how you’re thinking about your destination, whether it’s a stopping point or a pausing point.  And so I was wondering if you could discuss how you are thinking about, as the data come in, where that destination is, how it’s moving up.  If inflation doesn’t perform as you expect, do you want to have a policy rate that’s above the underlying inflation rate, for example, and do you have an estimate for where you think the underlying inflation rate might be in the economy right now? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so, again, we believe that we need to raise our policy stance overall to a level that is restrictive—and by that I mean, is meaningfully, putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation.  That’s what we need to see in the stance of policy.  We also  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL know that there are long and variable lags, particularly as they relate to inflation.  So it’s a challenging assessment.  So, what do you look at?  You look at broader financial conditions, as you know; you look at where rates are, real and nominal in some cases; you look at credit spreads; you look at financial conditions indexes. We also, I would think—and you see this in the—this is something we talked about today in the meeting and talk about in all of our meetings.  And you see this, I think, in the Committee forecast.  You want to be at a place where real rates are positive across the entire yield curve.  And I think that would be the case if you look at the numbers that we’re writing down and think about—you measure those against some sort of forward-looking assessment of inflation, inflation expectations.  I think you would see at that time—you’d see positive real rates across the yield curve, and that is also an important consideration.

MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard.   

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Thanks for the opportunity.  I just want to be clear on the SEPs.  You say it’s meeting by meeting, but it sure looks like we’re going 75–50–25.  Is 75 next month the baseline? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we make one decision per meeting, and the decision we made today was to raise the federal funds rate by 75 [basis points].  You’re right that the median for the year-end suggests another 125 basis points in rate increases, but there’s also, there’s another fairly large group that saw a 100 basis points addition to where we are today.  So that would be 25 basis points less.  So we’re going to make that decision at the meeting.  We didn’t make that restrictive level for the federal funds rate and getting there pretty quickly, and that’s what we’re thinking about.  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  So, just as a follow-up to that, I’m wondering about the sort of risk-management considerations here, given there’s some discussion now of overdoing it.  What’s the incentive to continue front-loading right now?  Is it lack of progress on inflation seen in the CPI reports?  Or is it a motivation to get as much done while the job market is still as strong as it is? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, what we’ve seen is, inflation has—our expectation has been that we would begin to see inflation come down, largely because of supply-side healing.  By now we would have thought that we’d have seen some of that.  We haven’t.  We have seen some supply-side healing, but inflation has not really come down.  If you look at core PCE inflation, which is a good measure of where inflation is running now, if you look at it on a 3-, 6-, and 12-month trailing annualized basis, you’ll see that inflation is at 4.8 percent, 4.5 percent, and 4.8 percent. So that’s a pretty good summary of where we are with inflation.  And that’s not where we expected or wanted to be.  So, what that tells us is that we need to continue, and we can—keep doing these, and we did today—do another large increase as we approach the level that we think we need to get to.  And we’re still discovering what that level is.  But people are writing that down in their SEP where they think policy needs to be.  So that’s how we’re thinking about it. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Colby. 

[SECTION]

COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times.  Chair Powell, how should we interpret the fact that core inflation is still not forecast in the SEP to be back to target in 2025, and yet the dot plot projects cuts as early as 2024?  And does that mean there’s a level of inflation above the 2 percent target that the Fed is willing to tolerate? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess core is at 2.1 in 2025—in the median—and headline is at 2.0, so that’s pretty close.  I mean, we write down our forecasts, and we figure out what the  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL median is, and we publish it.  So it’s not—I mean, I would say that if, actually, if the economy followed this path, this would be a pretty good outcome.  But you’re right—it is a tenth higher than 2 percent. 

[SECTION]

COLBY SMITH.  Okay.  Just as a quick follow-up:  I mean, if the concern is that underlying inflation is becoming more entrenched, perhaps, each month, then why forgo the more aggressive 100 basis point increase today, and does that risk having to do more later on? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  So we, as we said at the last press conference and in between that one and this one, we said that we would make our decision based on the overall data coming in.  So, if you remember, we got a surprisingly low reading in July and then a surprisingly high reading for August.  So I think you have to—you can’t really—you never want to overreact too much to any one data point. So if you look at them together—and, as I just mentioned, if you really look at this year’s inflation, 3-, 6-, and 12-month trailing, you see inflation is running too high.  It’s running 4.5 percent or above; you don’t need to know much more than that.  If that’s the one thing you know, you know that this Committee is committed to getting to a meaningfully restrictive stance of policy and staying there until we feel confident that inflation is coming down.  That’s how we think about it. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  I wanted to ask about the balance sheet.  You all have left open the possibility that you might sell mortgage-backed securities, but we’ve seen significant slowing in the housing market.  Mortgage rates have gone up significantly, and I’m just wondering whether conditions there might affect your plans for how quickly you have the runoff on the MBS side.    September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we, what we said, as you know, was that we would consider that once balance sheet runoff is well under way.  I would say it’s not something we’re considering right now and not something I expect to be considering in the near term.  It’s just, it’s something I think we will turn to, but that time, the time for turning to it, has not come and is not close. 

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA.  Will conditions in the housing market affect that decision?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I think a number of things might affect that decision, really.  The main thing is, we’re not considering that decision, and I don’t expect that we will any time soon. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Neil. 

[SECTION]

NEIL IRWIN.  Thanks.  Neil Irwin with Axios.  A number of commentators have come to the view, including over at the World Bank, that simultaneous global tightening around the world is, creates a risk of a global recession that’s worse than is necessary to bring inflation down.  How do you see that risk?  How do you think of coordination with your fellow central bankers?  And is there much risk of overdoing it on a global level? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we, actually, my colleagues and I, a number of my FOMC colleagues and I, just got back from one of our frequent trips to Basel, Switzerland, to meet with other senior central bank officials from around the world.  We are in pretty regular contact, and we exchange, of course—we all serve a domestic mandate, domestic objectives—in our case, the dual mandate, maximum employment and price stability.  But we regularly discuss what we’re seeing in terms of our own economy and international spillovers, and it’s a very ongoing, constant kind of a process. So we are very aware of what’s going on in other economies around the world and what that means for us, and vice versa.  The forecasts that we put together, that our staff puts together, and that we put together on our own always take all of that—try to take all of that into account.  I  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL mean, I can’t say that we do it perfectly, but it’s not as if we don’t think about the policy major economies that can have an effect on the U.S. economy.  That is very much baked into our own forecast and our own understanding of the U.S. economy, as best we can.  It won’t be perfect. So I don’t see—it’s hard to talk about collaboration in a world where people have very different levels of interest rates.  If you remember, there were coordinated cuts and raises and things like that at various times, but, really, we’re all, we’re in very different situations.  But I will tell you, our contact is more or less ongoing, and it’s not coordination, but there’s a lot of information sharing.  And we all, I think, are informed by what other important economies—economies that are important to the United States—are doing. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Craig.   

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES.  Craig Torres from Bloomberg.  Chair Powell, you talked about some ways the higher interest rates are affecting the economy, but we’ve also seen a resilient labor on the resilience of the economy.  After all, you and your colleagues said, “Well, we started tightening in March when we were talking about interest rates in the future.”  And, indeed, Treasury rates moved up, so we should have had a lot of tightening taking effect.  Why is the economy, in your view, so resilient, and does it mean that we might need a possibly higher terminal rate? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  You’re right, of course—the labor market, in particular, has been very strong.  But there are—the sectors of the economy that are most interest rate sensitive are certainly showing the effects of our tightening, and, of course, the obvious example is housing,  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL where you see declining activity of all different kinds and house price increases moving down.  So we’re having an effect on interest-sensitive spending.  I think, through exchange rates, we’re having an effect on exports and imports.  I think—so all of that’s happening, but you’re right, and we’ve said this:  This is a strong, robust economy.  People have savings on their balance sheet from the period when they couldn’t spend and where they were getting government transfers.  There’s still very significant savings out there, although not as much at the lower end of the income spectrum—but still, some savings out there to support growth.  The states are very flush with cash, so there’s good reason to think that this will continue to be a reasonably strong economy. Now, the data sort of are showing that growth is going to be below trend this year.  We think of trend as being about 1.8 percent, or in that range.  We’re forecasting growth well below that, and most forecasters are.  But you’re right—there’s certainly a possibility that growth can be stronger than that.  And that’s a good thing, because that means the economy will be more resistant to a significant downturn.  But, of course, we are focused on the thing I started with, which is getting inflation back down to 2 percent.  We can’t fail to do that.  I mean, if we were to fail to do that, that would be the thing that would be most painful for the people that we serve.  So for now, that has to be our overarching focus, and you see that, I think, in the SEP, in the levels of rates that we’ll be moving to reasonably quickly, assuming things turn out roughly in line with the SEP.  So that’s how we think about it. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Mike.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In a world of euphemisms that we live in here, with “below-trend growth” and “modest increase in unemployment,” I’m wondering if I can ask you a couple of direct questions for the American people.  Do the odds now favor, given where  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL you are and where you’re going with interest rates, favor a recession?  Four point four percent unemployment is about 1.3 million jobs.  Is that acceptable job loss?  And then, given that the data you look at is backward looking, and the lags in your policy are forward looking, and you don’t know what they are, how will you know, or will you know, if you’ve gone too far? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I don’t know what the odds are.  I think that there’s a very high likelihood that we’ll have a period of what I’ve mentioned is below-trend growth, by which I mean much lower growth, and we’re seeing that now.  So the median forecast, I think, this year among my colleagues and me was 0.2 percent growth.  So that’s very slow growth.  And then below trend next year.  I think the median was 1.2, also well below.  So that’s a slower, that’s a very slow level of growth, and it could give rise to increases in unemployment.  But I think that’s, so that is something that we think we need to have, and we think we need to have softer labor market conditions as well. We’re never going to say that there are too many people working, but the real point is this:  Inflation—what we hear from people when we meet with them is that they really are suffering from inflation.  And if we want to set ourselves up, really light the way to another period of a very strong labor market, we have got to get inflation behind us.  I wish there were a painless way to do that.  There isn’t.  So, what we need to do is get rates up to the point where we’re putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation, and that’s what we’re doing.  And we certainly don’t hope, we certainly haven’t given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest increase in unemployment.  Nonetheless, we need to complete this task. 

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  But how will you know, or will you know, if you’ve gone too far? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  It’s hard to hypothetically deal with that question.  I mean, again, our really tight focus now continues to be ongoing rate increases to get the policy rate up where it  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL needs to be.  And, as I said, you can look at this SEP as today’s estimate of where we think those rates would be.  Of course, they will evolve over time. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris Rugaber. 

[SECTION]

CHRIS RUGABER.  Thanks.  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.  I wanted to follow up with what you just mentioned about the labor market.  You’ve said several times that to have the labor market we want, we need price stability, and you suggested maybe there isn’t a tradeoff in the long run.  But in the short run, there is a lot of concern, as people have been expressing here, about higher unemployment as a result of these rate hikes or as a result of rate hikes.  So can you explain, though, what about high inflation now threatens the job market?  I mean, you seem to suggest inflation, high inflation, will eventually lead to a weaker job market.  So can you spell that out a little more for the general public on how that would work? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, for starters, people are seeing their wage increases eaten up by inflation.  So if your family is one where you spend most of your paycheck, every paycheck cycle, on gas, food, transportation, clothing, basics of life, and prices go up the way they’ve been going up, you’re in trouble right away.  You don’t have a cushion, and this is very painful for people at the lower end of the income and wealth spectrum.  So that’s what we’re hearing from people is, you know, very much—that inflation is really hurting. So how do we get rid of inflation?  And, as I mentioned, it would be nice if there were a way to just wish it away, but there isn’t.  We have to get supply and demand back into alignment, and the way we do that is by slowing the economy.  Hopefully, we do that by slowing the economy, and we see some softening in labor market conditions, and we see a big contribution from supply-side improvements, and things like that.  But none of that is guaranteed.    September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL In any case, we, our job is to deliver price stability, and I think—you can think of price stability as an asset that just delivers large benefits to society over a long period of time.  We really saw that for a long time.  The United States had 2 percent inflation, didn’t move around much, and that was enormously beneficial to the public that we serve.  And we have to get back to that and keep it for another long period of time.  To pull back from the task of doing that is, you’re just postponing—the record shows that if you postpone that, the delay is only likely to lead to more pain.  So I think we’re moving to do what we need to do and do our jobs, and that’s what you see us doing. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence for Fox Business.  So you had said that Americans and businesses need to feel some economic pain as we go forward.  How long from here should Americans be prepared for that economic pain? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  How long?  I mean, it really depends on how long it takes for wages and, more than that, prices to come down for inflation to come down.  And so what you see in our projections today is that inflation moves down significantly over the course of next year and then more the next year after that.  And I think once you’re on that path, that’s a good thing.  And things will start to feel better to people—they’ll feel lower inflation, they’ll feel that the economy is improving.  And also, if our projections are close to right, you’ll see that the costs in unemployment are, they’re meaningful, and they’re certainly very meaningful to the people who lose their jobs.  And we talk about that in our meetings quite a lot. But, at the same time, we’d be setting the economy up for another long period—this era has been noted for very long expansions.  We’ve had three of the four longest in measured  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL history since we got inflation under control.  And that’s not an accident.  So when inflation is low and stable, you can have these 9, 10, 11—10-year, anyway, expansions, and you can see what we saw in 2018, ’19, and ’20, which was very low unemployment, the biggest wage gains going to people at the low end of the spectrum, the smallest racial gaps that we’ve seen since we started keeping track of that.  So we want to get back to that.  But, to get there, we’re going to have to get supply and demand back in alignment, and that’s going to take tight monetary policy for a period of time. 

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE.  As a follow-up, what is that economic pain in your mind?  Is it job losses?  Is it higher interest rates on credit cards?  What is that economic pain? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So it’s all of those things.  Higher interest rates, slower growth, and a softening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve.  But they’re not as painful as failing to restore price stability and then having to come back and do it down the road again and doing it at a time when, actually, now people have really come to expect high inflation.  If the concept of high inflation becomes entrenched in people’s economic thinking about their just rises, and so we want to avoid that.  We want to act aggressively now and get this job done and keep at it until it’s done. 

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Nicole, from CNN.   

[SECTION]

NICOLE GOODKIND.  Thank you, Chairman Powell.  Nicole Goodkind, CNN Business.  Existing home sales have fallen for seven months straight, mortgage rates are at their highest level since 2008, yet mortgage demand increased this week, and housing prices are still elevated.  Now, at the end of your June press conference, you mentioned plans to reset the  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL housing market.  I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you mean when you say “reset” and what you think it will take to actually get there. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So when I say “reset,” I’m not looking at a particular, specific set of data or anything.  What I’m really saying is that we’ve had a time of a red-hot housing market all over the country, where, famously, houses were selling to the first buyer at 10 percent above the ask, before even seeing the house.  That kind of thing.  So there was a big imbalance between supply and demand.  Housing prices were going up at an unsustainably fast level.  So the line with rents and other housing market fundamentals, and that’s a good thing. For the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level—at a reasonable pace—and that people can afford houses again.  And I think we—so we probably, in the housing market, have to go through a correction to get back to that place.  There’s also, there are also longer-run issues, though, with the housing market.  As you know, we’re—it’s difficult to find lots now close enough to cities and things like that, so builders are having a hard time getting zoning and lots and workers and materials and things like that.  But from a sort of business cycle standpoint, this difficult correction should put the housing market back into better balance. 

[SECTION]

NICOLE GOODKIND.  Just to follow, though, shelter made up such a large part of this hot CPI report that we saw.  Do you think that there is a lag and that we will see that come down in the coming months?  Or do you think that there’s still this imbalance that needs to be 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time.  We’re looking for it to come down, but it’s not exactly clear when that will happen.  So it may addressed?  September 21, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL take some time, so I think, hope for the best, plan for the worst.  So I think, on shelter inflation, you’ve just got to assume that it’s going to remain pretty high for a while.   

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we’ll go to Jean for the last question. 

[SECTION]

JEAN YUNG.  Hi.  Jean Yung with Market News.  You’ve talked about the need to get real rates into positive territory, and you said earlier that policy is just moving into that territory now.  So I’m curious, how restrictive is rates at 4.6 percent expected—is that expected to be next year?  How restrictive? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So I think if you look, when we get to—if we—let’s assume we do get to that level, which I think is likely.  What you’re going to do is, you’re going to adjust that for some forward-looking measure of inflation.  And that could be—you pick your measure.  It could be—there are all kinds of different things you could pick and you get—but what you’ll get is a positive number.  In all cases, you will get forward inflation expectations in the short term, I think, that are going to be, assuming that we’re doing our jobs appropriately, that will be significant. So you’ll have a positive [real] federal funds rate at that point, which could be 1 percent or so, but—I mean, I don’t know exactly what it would be.  But it would be significantly positive when we get to that level.  And let me say, we’ve written down what we think is a plausible path for the federal funds rate.  The path that we actually execute will be enough.  It will be enough to restore price stability.  So this is something that, as you can see, they’ve moved up, and we’re going to continue to watch incoming data and the evolving outlook and ask ourselves whether our policy is in the right place as we go. Thank you very much.  ",other,FOMC Press Conference Transcript
54,2022-11-02,"PRELIMINARY Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference   

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon.  My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.  We have both the tools that we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.  Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.  Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.  In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.  Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 75 basis points, and we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate.  We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent.  In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.  Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance of policy for some time.  I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.   The U.S. economy has slowed significantly from last year’s rapid pace.  Real GDP rose at a pace of 2.6 percent last quarter but is unchanged so far this year.   Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter.  Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year’s rapid pace, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions.  Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.  Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated.   November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference 

[SECTION]

PRELIMINARY Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 289,000 jobs per month over August and September.  Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace of job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers.  The labor force participation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year.   Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.  Over the 12 months ending in September, total PCE prices rose 6.2 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5.1 percent.  And the recent inflation data have again come in higher than expected.  Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services.  Russia’s war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional upward pressure on inflation. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.  But that is not grounds for complacency; the longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched.  The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.  November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference 

[SECTION]

PRELIMINARY At today’s meeting the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points.  And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy.  With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 3-3/4 percentage points this year.  We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.  Financial conditions have tightened significantly in response to our policy actions, and we are seeing the effects on demand in the most interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing.  It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.  That’s why we say in our statement that in determining the pace of future increases in the target range, we will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation.  At some point, as I’ve said in the last 2 press conferences, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases, as we approach the level of interest rates that will be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal.  There is significant uncertainty around that level of interest rates.  Even so, we still have some ways to go, and incoming data since our last meeting suggest that the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected.  Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.  And we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. We are taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply.  Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.  Reducing inflation is  November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference 

[SECTION]

PRELIMINARY likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.  Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices in the longer run.  The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.  We will stay the course, until the job is done.   To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.

COLBY SMITH.  Thank you. Colby Smith with The Financial Times. On the need to slow the pace of rate increases at some point, is a downshift contingent on a string of better inflation data specifically between now and let's say the December meeting? Or is that something that the Fed could potentially proceed with independent of that data, given the lag affect that you mentioned?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So a couple things on that; we do need to see inflation coming down that's what we'd all love to see but that's, I've never thought of that as the appropriate test for slowing the pace of increases or for identifying the appropriately restrictive level that we're aiming for. We need to bring our policy stance down to a level that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent objective over the medium term. How will we know that we've reached that level? Well, we'll take into account the full range of analysis and data that bear on that question guided by our assessment of how much financial conditions have tightened, the effects that that tightening is actually having on the real economy and on inflation, taking  November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference

PRELIMINARY into consideration lags, as I mentioned. We will be looking at real rates, for example, all across the yield curve and all other financial conditions as we make that assessment.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH. Howard. 

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard. Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters. I'm sure there's going to be tons of confusion out there about whether this means you're going to slow in increase?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, what I want to do is put that question of pace in the context of our broader tightening program if I may, and talk about the statement language along the way. So I think you can think about our tightening program as really addressing three questions; the first of which was and has been, how fast to go, the second is how high to raise our policy rate, and then third will be, eventually, how long to remain at a restrictive level. So, on the first question, how fast to tighten policy, it's been very important that we move expeditiously and we have clearly done so, we've moved 3-3/4 percent since March, admittedly from a base of zero. It's a historically fast pace and that's certainly appropriate given the persistence and strength in inflation and the low level from which we started. So now we come to the second question, which is how high to raise our policy rate, and we're saying that we'd raise that rate to a level that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation to our 2 percent target over time and we put that into our post-meeting statement because that really does become the important question we think now, is how far to go and I'll talk more about that. We think there's some ground to cover but before we meet that test and that's why we say that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate, and as I mentioned, incoming data between the meetings, both a strong labor market report but particularly the CPI report, do suggest to me that we may ultimately move to higher levels than  November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference 

[SECTION]

PRELIMINARY we thought at the time of the September meeting. That level is very uncertain though, and I would say we're going to find it over time. Of course, with the lags between policy and economic activity, there's a lot of uncertainty so we note that in determining the pace of future increases, we'll take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy as well as the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. So, I would say, as we come closer to that level, move more into restrictive territory, the question of speed become less important than the second and third questions, and that's why I've said it the last two press conferences, that at some point it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases. So that time is coming, and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that. No decision has been made. It is likely we'll have a discussion about this at the next meeting, a discussion. To be clear, let me say again, the question of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than the question of how high to raise rates and how long to keep monetary policy restricted, which really will be our principal focus.  

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.   If I could follow-up on that; to what degree was there an importance or weight given to a need to signal this possibility now, given all the concerns really around the globe about fed policy sort of driving ahead and everybody else dealing with their own stress as a result?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think I'm pleased that we have moved as fast as we have, I don't think we've over-tightened, I think there's very difficult to make a case that our current level is too tight, given that inflation still runs well above the federal funds rate. So I think that at this meeting, as in the last two meetings, as I've mentioned, I've said that we, that there would come a point, and this was a meeting at which we had a discussion about what that might mean and we did discuss this and as I mentioned, we'll discuss it again in December. But there's no, I  November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference 

[SECTION]

PRELIMINARY don't have any sense that we've over-tightened or moved too fast. I think it's been good and a successful program that we've gotten this far this fast. Remember though that we still think there's a need for ongoing rate increases and we have some ground left to cover here and cover it we will.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH. Nick.  

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, core PCE inflation on a 3 or 6-month annualized basis and on a 12-month basis has been running in the high 4's, close to 5 percent. Is there any reason to think you won't have to raise rates at least above that level to be confident that you are imparting enough restraint to bring inflation down? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, this is the question of [inaudible] does the policy rate need to get above the inflation rate? And I would say, there are a range of view on it. That's the classic Taylor principle view. But I would think you'd look more at a forward, a forward-looking measure of inflation to look at that. But, I think the answer is, we'll want to get the policy rate to a level where it is, where the real interest rate is positive. We will want to do that. I do not think of it as the single and only touchstone though. I think you put some weight on that, you also put some weight on rates across the curve. Very few people borrow at the short end, at the federal funds rate for example, so households and businesses, if they're very meaningfully positive interest rates all across the curve for them, credit spreads are larger so borrowing rates are significantly higher and I think financial conditions have tightened quite a bit. So, I would look at that as an important feature. I'd put some weight on it but I wouldn't say it's something that is the single dominant thing to look at.   November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS.  If I could follow-up, what is your best assessment or the staff's best assessment right now of the current rate of underlying inflation?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I don't have a specific number for you there. There are many, many models that look at that and I mean one way to look at it is that it's a pretty stationary object and that when inflation runs above that level for sure, substantially above for some time, you'll see it move up, but the movement will be fairly gradual. So I think that's what the principle models would tend to say but I wouldn't want to land on any one assessment. There are many different, as you know, many different people publishing assessment of underlying inflation.

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi Chair Powell, thank you for taking our questions. Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times. I wondered, do you see any evidence at this stage that inflation is or is at risk of becoming entrenched?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Is inflation becoming entrenched? So, I guess I would start by pointing to expectations, so if we saw longer term expectations moving up, that would be very troubling, and they were moving up a little bit at the middle part of this year, and they've moved now back down, that's one piece of data. Shorter term inflation expectations moved up between the last, this meeting, the last meeting and this meeting, and we don't think those are as indicative, but they may be important in the wage setting process. There's a school of thought that believes that. So that's very concerning. I guess the other thing I would say is that the longer we have, we're now 18 months into this episode of high inflation and we don't have a clearly identified scientific way of understanding at what point inflation becomes entrenched. And so,  November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference 

[SECTION]

PRELIMINARY the thing we need to do from a risk management standpoint is to use our tools forcefully but thoughtfully, and get inflation under control, get it down to 2 percent, get it behind us. That's what we really need to do and what we're strongly committed to doing.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.  

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel from The Washington Post. The statement points to lag times, I'm wondering if you can walk us through how you judge those lag affects, what that timeline looks like over the coming months or even a year and where you would expect it to show up in different parts of the economy.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So, the way I would think about that is it's a commonly, for a long time, thought that monetary policy works with long and variable lags and that it works first on financial conditions and then on economic activity and then perhaps later than that even on inflation. So that's been the thinking for a long time. There was an old literature that made those lags out to be fairly long. There's newer literature that says that they're shorter and the truth is, we don't have a lot of data of inflation of this high in what is now the modern economy. One big difference now is that it used to be that you would raise the federal funds rate, financial conditions would react and then that would affect economic activity and inflation. Now, financial conditions react well before an expectation of monetary policy. That's the way it has moved for a quarter of a century is in the direction of financial conditions, then monetary policy because the economists that also think that once financial conditions change, that the effects on the economy are actually faster than they would have been before. We don't know that, I guess the thing that I would say is, it's highly uncertain, highly uncertain, and so from a risk management standpoint but we do need, it would be irresponsible not to, to ignore them. but you want to consider them  November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference 

[SECTION]

PRELIMINARY but not take them literally. So, I think it's a very difficult place to be but I would tend to be, want to be in the middle looking carefully at what's actually happening with the economy. And trying to make good decisions from a risk management standpoint, remembering of course that if we were to over-tighten, we could then use our tools strongly to support the economy, whereas if we don't get inflation under control because we don't tighten enough, now we're in a situation where inflation will become entrenched and the costs, the employment costs in particular, will be much higher potentially. So, from a risk management standpoint, we want to be sure that we don't make the mistake of either failing to tighten enough, or loosening policy too soon.  

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL. And if I could follow-up, should we interpret the addition to the statement to mean that more weight is put into those lag affects than they would have been after previous rate hikes?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Well I think as we move now into restrictive territory, as we make these ongoing rate hikes and policy becomes more restrictive, it'll be appropriate now to be thinking more about lag. Of course, we think about lag-- the lags are just sort of a basic part of monetary policy, but we will be thinking about them, but we won't be, I think we'll be considering them but because it's appropriate to do so. Let me say this, it is very premature to be thinking about pausing. So people, when they hear lags, they think about a pause. It's very premature in my view to think about or be talking about pausing our rate hike. We have a ways to go, our policy, we need ongoing rate hikes to get to that level of sufficiently restrictive. And we don't, of course we don't really know exactly where that is. We have a sense and we'll write down in September-- sorry, in the December meeting, a new summary of economic projections which updates that. But I would expect just to continue updated based on what we are seeing with incoming data. Thanks,   November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference

[SECTION]

NEIL IRWIN.  Thanks, Chair Powell, Neil Irwin, Axios. As you look around the economy, the clearest impact of your tightening so far has been on housing, maybe some venture funded tech companies, it's been relatively narrow in terms of the labor market, consumer demand, a lot of sectors you don't see a ton of effect. Is the pathway and channels through which monetary policy works changing? Is it narrower than it used to be? And on housing in particular, are you at all worried that you're cramping housing supply in ways that might cause problems down the road?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I don't know that the channels through which policy works have changed that much. I would say a big channel is the labor market and the labor market is very, very strong. Very strong. And household by, of course have strong balance sheets. So, we go into this with a strong labor market and excess demand in the labor market, as you can see through many different things and also with households who have strong spending power built up. So it come down. It'll take time, we think. So, sorry, was I getting to your question there? 

[SECTION]

NEIL IRWIN.  Housing. 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  Oh housing, the housing part of it. Yeah, so we look at housing, of course, housing is significantly affected by these higher rates, which are really back where they were before the global financial crisis, they're not historically high, but they're much higher than they've been and you're seeing housing activity decline, and you're seeing housing prices growing at a faster rate and in some parts of the country, declining. You know, I would say  November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference 

[SECTION]

PRELIMINARY housing was, the housing market was very overheated for the couple of years after the pandemic as demand increased and rates were low. We all know the stories of how overheated the housing housing market needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand. We're well aware of the, of what's going on there. From a financial stability standpoint, we didn't see in this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the global financial courses. Housing credit was very carefully, much more carefully managed by the lenders so it's a very different situation and doesn't present potential financial, doesn't appear to present financial stability issues. But no, we do understand that that's really where a very big effect of our policy is.  

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria.  

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDO. Hi, Victoria Guido with Politico. I wanted to ask about the labor workers, and I'm just curious to what extent you do and don't draw signal from that? So, for example, if wage growth is slowing and if maybe the unemployment rate starts to tick up, will that make you sort of decrease your focus on job openings? What do you see, are wages what's really important? How are you thinking about the labor market as it relates to inflation?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  So we talk a lot about vacancies in the, vacancy and unemployed rate, but it's just one, it's just another data series. It's been unusually important in this cycle because it's been so out of line. But so has quits. So have wages. So, we look at a very wide range of data on the unemployment, on the labor market. So, I'd start with unemployment which is typically the single statistic you would look to is at a 50-year low, 3-1/2 percent, we're getting really nothing in labor supply now. We had I think very small increase this year which we had really thought, we thought we would get that back. Most analysts thought we would get some  November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference 

[SECTION]

PRELIMINARY labor supply coming in. You mentioned wages, so I guess I would characterize that it's sort of a mixed picture. It's true with average hourly earnings you see, so I would call it a flattening out at a level that's well-above the level that would be consistent over time with 2 percent inflation, assuming a reasonable productivity. With the ECI reading this week, again, a mixed picture. The headline number was a disappointment, let's just say it was high. It didn't show a decline. There some raise of highlight inside that if you look at private sector workers, that did come down, that compensation did come down. Overall though, the broader picture is of an overheated labor that would hold the market where it is. So that's the picture. Do we see, we keep looking for signs that sort of the beginning of a gradual softening is happening and maybe that's there, but it's not obvious to me because wages aren't coming down, they're just moving sideways at an elevated level, both ECI and average hourly earnings. We want to see, we would love to see vacancies coming down, quits coming down. They are coming down, vacancies are below their all-time high but not by as much as we thought because-- and that, the data series is volatile, we never take any one reading, we always look at two or three. So, it's a mixed picture. I don't see the case for real softening just yet. But we look at, I guess I just, as I just showed you, we look at a very broad range of data on the labor market.  

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDO. So do you see wages as being a significant driver of inflation? I think wages have an effect on inflation and inflation has an effect on wages.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL.  I think that's always been the case. There's always, going back and forth, the question is is that really elevated right now? I don't think so. I don't think wages are the principal story of why prices are going up. I don't that. I also don't think that we see a wage price spiral, but again, it's not something you can, once you see it, you're in trouble. So, we don't want  November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference 

[SECTION]

PRELIMINARY to see it. We want wages to go up, we just want them to go up at a level that's sustainable and consistent with 2 percent inflation. And we think we can, we do think that given the data that we have, that this labor market can soften without having to soften as much as history would indicate through the unemployment channel. It can soften through job openings declining, we think there's room for that. But we won't know that, that'll be, that'll be discovered empirically.  

[SECTION]

KAYLA TAUSCHE. Thank you so much, Kayla Tausche from CNBC. Earlier last month the United Nations warned that there could be a global recession if central banks didn't change course. The new UK prime minister warned of a profound economic crisis there. I'm wondering how the Fed is weighing international developments in light of a very strong economy here in the U.S. that would seem to be bucking those trends.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So of course we, we keep close tabs on economic developments and also geopolitical developments that are relevant to the economy abroad. We're in very frequent contact with our foreign counterparts both through the IMF meetings and the regular meetings with central banks that we have, and I have one this weekend with many, many central bankers. So, we're in touch with all of that. So, I guess what, it's clearly a time, a difficult time in the global economy, we're seeing very high inflation in Europe, significantly because of high energy prices related to the war in Ukraine. And we're seeing China is have issues with the zero-COVID policy and much slower growth than we're used to seeing so we're seeing, we see those difficulties, the strong dollar is a challenge for some countries. But we haven't, we take all of that into account in our models, we think about the spillovers and that sort of thing. Here in the United States we have a strong economy and we have an economy where inflation is running at 5 percent, core PCE inflation, which is a really good indicator of what's going on for us is the way we see it is running at 5.1 percent on a 12-month basis and sort of similar to that on a 3, 6, and 9- November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference 

[SECTION]

PRELIMINARY month basis. So we know that we need to use our tools to get inflation under control. The world's not going to be better off if we fail to do that. That's a task we need to do. Price stability in the United States is a good thing for the global economy over a long period of time. Price stability is the kind of thing that pays dividends for our economy, for decades hopefully, even though it may be difficult to get it back, getting it back is something that gives, that provides value to the people we serve for the long run.  

[SECTION]

KAYLA TAUSCHE. If I could just follow-up up on that. Thank you. The Fed has acknowledged in the past that the tools that you have don't affect things like energy and food prices that stem from some of those conflicts overseas and they're some of the biggest pain points for consumers. So, as you pursue the current path that you've outlined, is there a risk that some of those prices simply don't come down?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So we don't directly affect for the most part food and energy prices, but the demand channel does affect them just at the margin. The thing about the United States is that we also have strong-- in many other jurisdictions the principle problem really is energy. In the United States we also have a demand issue. We've got an imbalance between demand and supply which you see in many parts of the economy. So our tools are well-suited to work on that problem, and that's what we're doing. Your right though, we don't, the price of oil is set globally and it's not something we can affect. I think by the actions that we take though, we help keep longer term inflation expectations anchored and keep the public believing in 2 percent inflation by the things that we do, even in times when energy is part of the story of why inflation is high.

JONNELLE MARTE. Hi Chair Powell, Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg. So, the Fed is facing two more ethics related incidents with the revision of the financial statements from President Bostic and the President Bullard speaking at a closed event. So, some senators, like Elizabeth Warren, are saying that this is a sign of greater ethics problems at the Fed. Could you talk about what this does to the public's trust in the bank and what the Fed is doing to prevent this kind of behavior from becoming common? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Sure, so you're right, the public's trust is really the Fed's and any central bank's most important asset and any time one of us, one of the policy makers violates or falls short of those rules, we do risk undermining that trust and we take that very seriously. We do. So, at the beginning of our meeting yesterday actually, we had a Committee discussion of the full Committee on the importance of holding ourselves individually and collectively accountable for knowing and following the high standard that's set out in our exciting rules with respect to both personal investment activities and external communications. And we've taken a number of steps and I would just say we do understand how important those issues are. I would say that our new investment program that we have is up now and running and actually it was through that that the problems with President Bostic's disclosures were discovered, when he filed his new disclosure, that's, we now have a central group here at the Board of Governors that looks into disclosures and follows them and approves people's disclosures and also all of their trades. Any trade anyone has to make is covered, has to be approved, pre-approved and there's a lag, it has to be pre-approved 45 days before it happens. So there's no ability to gain market, so it's a really good system, it worked here. And we, I think we all said to each other today, yesterday actually, yesterday morning, we re-committed to each other and to this institution to hold ourselves to the highest standards and avoid these problems.   November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. Earlier this year you touted the 3-month bell yield out to 18 months as the yield curve with 100 percent explanatory power. And you said, quote; if it's inverted, that means the Fed's going to cut, which means the economy is weak. That curve is only 2 basis points away from inversion now, so I'm wondering why you are so confident that you have not over tightened particularly given that rates work with a lag.  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Well, so we do monitor the near term forward spread, you're right. And it's, that's been our preferred measure. We think it, just empirically it dominates the ones that people tend to look at, which is twos, tens, and things like that. So, it's not inverted, and also you have to look at why things, why the rate curve is doing what it's doing. It can be doing that because it affects, it expects cuts or because it expects inflation to come down. In this case, if you're in a situation where the markets are pricing in significant declines in inflation, that's going to affect the forward curve so yes, we monitor it, you're right. And that's what I would say.  

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow-up; you also said several meetings ago that the risk of doing too little outweighed the risk of doing too much. Is what you're trying to tell us today is that that risk assessment has changed a little bit?   November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference 

[SECTION]

PRELIMINARY 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Well what's happened is time has passed and we've raised interest rates by 375 basis points. I would not, I would not change a word in that statement though. I think until we get inflation down, you'll be hearing that from me. Again, if we over tighten, and we don't want to, we want to get this exactly right, but if we over tighten, then we have the ability with our tools, which are powerful, to, as we showed at the beginning of the pandemic episode, we can support economic activity strongly if that happens, if that's necessary. On the other hand, if you make the mistake in the other direction, and you let this drag on, then it's a year or two down the road and you're realizing inflation behaving the way it can, you're realizing you didn't actually get it, you have to go back in. By then the risk really is that it has become entrenched in people's thinking and the record is that the employment costs, the cost to the people that we don't want to hurt, they go up with the passage of time. That's really how I look at it. So, that isn't going to change. What has changed though, you're right, is we're farther along now. And I think as we're farther along, we're now focused on that what's the place, what's the level we need to get to rates and I don't know what we'll do when we get there, by the way, it doesn't, we'll have to see. There's been no decision or discussion around exactly what steps we would take at that point. But the first thing is to find your way there.

Just to go back to housing for a minute, you mentioned the impact that rate increases have had on housing, home sales are down 25 percent in the past year, and so forth, but none of this is really showing up in, as you know, in the government's inflation measures. And as we go forward, private real-time data is clearly showing these hits to housing. Are you going to need to put a greater weight  November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference 

[SECTION]

PRELIMINARY on that in order to ascertain things like whether there's over tightening going on or will you still focus as much on the more lagging government indicators? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So this is an interesting subject. So I start by saying I guess that the measure that's in the CPI and the PCE, it captures rents for all tenants, not just the new, not just new leases. And that makes sense actually because that, for that reason, that conceptually that is, that's sort of the right target for monetary policy. And the same thing is true for owners' equivalent rent which comes off of, it's a re-weighting of tenant rents. The private measures are of course good at picking up the, at the margin, the new leases and they tell you a couple things; one thing is, once you, I think right now, if you look at the pattern of that series of the new leases, it's very pro-cyclical, so rents went up much more than the CPI and PCE rents did. And now they're coming down faster. So but what you're, the implication is that there are still as people, as non-new leases rollover and expire, right? You still, they're still in the pipeline, there's still some significant rate increases coming. Okay? But at some point, once you get through that, the new leases are going to tell you, what they're telling you is there will come a point at which rent inflation will start to come down. But that point is well out from where we are now. So we're well-aware of that of course and we look at it. And we've, but I would say that in terms of the right way to think about inflation really is to look at the measure that we do look at, but considering that we also know that at some point you'll see rents coming down.  

[SECTION]

PRELIMINARY 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. We're not targeting any one or two particular things. Our message should be, what I'm trying to do is make sure that our message is clear, which is that we think we have a ways to go, we have some ground to cover with interest rates before we get to, before we get to that level of interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive. And putting that in the statement and identifying that as a goal is an important step. And that's meant to put that question really as the important one now going forward. I've also said that we think that the level of rates that we estimated in September, the incoming data suggests that that's actually going to be higher and that's been the pattern. I mean I would have little confidence that the forecast, if we made a forecast today, if we were doing an SEP today, the pattern has been that one after another they go up and that'll end when it ends, but there's no sense that inflation is coming down, it just, if you look at the-- I have a table of the last 12 months of 12-month readings and there's really no pattern there. We're exactly where we were a year ago. So, okay, so I would also say it's premature to discuss pausing. And it's not something that we're thinking about, that's really not a conversation to be had now. We have a ways to go. And the last thing I'll say is that I would want people to understand our commitment to getting this done. And to not making the mistake of not doing enough or the mistake of withdrawing our strong policy and doing that too soon. So those, I control those messages and that's my job.

EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Edward Lawrence with FOX Business, thank you, Fed Chairman. So, how big of a headwind is all the fiscal spending to what the Federal Reserve's trying to do to get inflation back to the 2 percent target?  

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. In theory it was a headwind this year, but I do think the broader context is that you have households that have these significant amounts of savings and can keep  November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference

PRELIMINARY spending even in-- so I think those two things do tend to wage, to sort of counter balance each other out. It appears, consumer spending is still positive, it's at pretty modest growth levels, it's not shrinking but and people are and the banks that deal with retail customers and many retailers will tell you that the consumers are still buying and they're still, they're fine, so I don't know how big the fiscal headwinds are and they haven't shown up in the way that we thought they would in restraining spending. So, it must have to do with the savings that people have.  

[SECTION]

EDWARD LAWRENCE. So what about the spending? There's tens of billions yet to be spent. I mean from the Inflation Reduction Act, the American Rescue Plan, CHIPS Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, how does that play into your thinking about the future? 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. It's, demand is going to have some support from those savings, and also from the strong demand that's still in the labor market. We still see pretty significant demand and a tightening labor market in some respects, although I think overall I would say it's not really tightening or loosening. So we see those things and what those things tell us is that our job is going to require some resolve and some patience over time. We're going to have to stick with this. And that's just, we take all that as a given but we know what our objective is and we know what our tools can do, and that's how we think about it.

MICHELLE SMITH. Thanks, we'll go to Nancy for the last question.  

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi Chair Powell, Nancy Marshall-Genzer from possible?   

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Has it narrowed? Yes. Is it still possible? Yes. I think, we've always said it was going to be difficult, but I think to the extent rates have to go higher and stay higher November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference

PRELIMINARY for longer becomes harder to see the path, it's narrowed. I would say the path has narrowed over the course of the last year, really. Hard to say. Hard to say. Again, I would say that the sort of array of data in the labor market is highly unusual and to many economists, there is a path to, as you ordinarily there's a relationship to GDP going down and vacancies declining, translating into unemployment or there's Okun's law. So all those things are relationships that are in the data and they're very real. Data's a little bit different this time though, because you have this tremendously high level of vacancies and we think on a very steep part of the Beveridge curve. All I would say is that the job losses may turn out to be less than would be indicated by those traditional measures because job openings are so elevated and because the labor market is so strong. Again, that's going to be something we discover empirically. I think no one knows whether there's going to be a recession or not, and if so, how bad that recession would be. And our job is to restore price stability so that we can have a strong labor market that benefits all over time. And that's what we're going to do.  narrowed? 

[SECTION]

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Just real quickly; why do you feel like the window has 

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Because we haven't seen inflation coming down. The implication of inflation not coming down and what we would expect by now to have seen is that as the, really as the supply side problems have resolved themselves, we would have expected goods inflation to come down by now, long since by now. And it really hasn't although it's, actually it has come down but it's, not to the extent that we had hoped. At the same time, now you see services inflation, core services inflation moving up and I just think that the inflation picture has become more and more challenging over the course of this year, without question. That means that we  November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference
