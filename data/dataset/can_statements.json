        "text": "The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 1\u00bd%, with the Bank Rate at 1\u00be% and the deposit rate at 1\u00bd%. The Bank is also continuing its policy of quantitative tightening (QT).\nInflation globally and in Canada continues to rise, largely driven by higher prices for energy and food. In Canada, CPI inflation reached 6.8% for the month of April \u2013 well above the Bank\u2019s forecast \u2013 and will likely move even higher in the near term before beginning to ease. As pervasive input price pressures feed through into consumer prices, inflation continues to broaden, with core measures of inflation ranging between 3.2% and 5.1%. Almost 70% of CPI categories now show inflation above 3%. The risk of elevated inflation becoming entrenched has risen. The Bank will use its monetary policy tools to return inflation to target and keep inflation expectations well anchored.\nThe increase in global inflation is occurring as the global economy slows. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, China\u2019s COVID-related lockdowns, and ongoing supply disruptions are all weighing on activity and boosting inflation. The war has increased uncertainty and is putting further upward pressure on prices for energy and agricultural commodities. This is dampening the outlook, particularly in Europe. In the United States, private domestic demand remains robust, despite the economy contracting in the first quarter of 2022. US labour market strength continues, with wage pressures intensifying. Global financial conditions have tightened and markets have been volatile.\nCanadian economic activity is strong and the economy is clearly operating in excess demand. National accounts data for the first quarter of 2022 showed GDP growth of 3.1 percent, in line with the Bank\u2019s April Monetary Policy Report (MPR) projection. Job vacancies are elevated, companies are reporting widespread labour shortages, and wage growth has been picking up and broadening across sectors. Housing market activity is moderating from exceptionally high levels. With consumer spending in Canada remaining robust and exports anticipated to strengthen, growth in the second quarter is expected to be solid.\nWith the economy in excess demand, and inflation persisting well above target and expected to move higher in the near term, the Governing Council continues to judge that interest rates will need to rise further. The policy interest rate remains the Bank\u2019s primary monetary policy instrument, with quantitative tightening acting as a complementary tool. The pace of further increases in the policy rate will be guided by the Bank\u2019s ongoing assessment of the economy and inflation, and the Governing Council is prepared to act more forcefully if needed to meet its commitment to achieve the 2% inflation target.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is July 13, 2022. The Bank will publish its next full outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the MPR at the same time."

The Bank is also continuing its policy of quantitative tightening.\nThe global and Canadian economies are evolving broadly in line with the Bank\u2019s July projection. The effects of COVID-19 outbreaks, ongoing supply disruptions, and the war in Ukraine continue to dampen growth and boost prices.\nGlobal inflation remains high and measures of core inflation are moving up in most countries. In response, central banks around the world continue to tighten monetary policy. Economic activity in the United States has moderated, although the US labour market remains tight. China is facing ongoing challenges from COVID shutdowns. Commodity prices have been volatile: oil, wheat and lumber prices have moderated while natural gas prices have risen.\nIn Canada, CPI inflation eased in July to 7.6% from 8.1% because of a drop in gasoline prices.\u00a0 However, inflation excluding gasoline increased and data indicate a further broadening of price pressures, particularly in services. The Bank\u2019s core measures of inflation continued to move up, ranging from 5% to 5.5% in July. Surveys suggest that short-term inflation expectations remain high. The longer this continues, the greater the risk that elevated inflation becomes entrenched.\nThe Canadian economy continues to operate in excess demand and labour markets remain tight. Canada\u2019s GDP grew by 3.3% in the second quarter. While this was somewhat weaker than the Bank had projected, indicators of domestic demand were very strong \u2013 consumption grew by about 9\u00bd% and business investment was up by close to 12%. With higher mortgage rates, the housing market is pulling back as anticipated, following unsustainable growth during the pandemic. The Bank continues to expect the economy to moderate in the second half of this year, as global demand weakens and tighter monetary policy here in Canada begins to bring demand more in line with supply.\nGiven the outlook for inflation, the Governing Council still judges that the policy interest rate will need to rise further. Quantitative tightening is complementing increases in the policy rate. As the effects of tighter monetary policy work through the economy, we will be assessing how much higher interest rates need to go to return inflation to target. The Governing Council remains resolute in its commitment to price stability and will continue to take action as required to achieve the 2% inflation target.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is October 26, 2022. The Bank will publish its next full outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the MPR at the same time."

The Bank is also continuing its policy of quantitative tightening (QT).\nInflation in Canada is higher and more persistent than the Bank expected in its April Monetary Policy Report (MPR), and will likely remain around 8% in the next few months. While global factors such as the war in Ukraine and ongoing supply disruptions have been the biggest drivers, domestic price pressures from excess demand are becoming more prominent. More than half of the components that make up the CPI are now rising by more than 5%. With this broadening of price pressures, the Bank\u2019s core measures of inflation have moved up to between 3.9% and 5.4%. Also, surveys indicate more consumers and businesses are expecting inflation to be higher for longer, raising the risk that elevated inflation becomes entrenched in price- and wage-setting. If that occurs, the economic cost of restoring price stability will be higher.\nGlobal inflation is higher, reflecting the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, ongoing supply constraints, and strong demand. Many central banks are tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, and the resulting tighter financial conditions are moderating economic growth. In the United States, high inflation and rising interest rates are contributing to a slowdown in domestic demand. China\u2019s economy is being held back by waves of restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 outbreaks. Oil prices remain high and volatile. The Bank now expects global economic growth to slow to about 3\u00bd% this year and 2% in 2023 before strengthening to 3% in 2024.\nFurther excess demand has built up in the Canadian economy. Labour markets are tight with a record low unemployment rate, widespread labour shortages, and increasing wage pressures. With strong demand, businesses are passing on higher input and labour costs by raising prices. Consumption is robust, led by a rebound in spending on hard-to-distance services. Business investment is solid and exports are being boosted by elevated commodity prices. The Bank estimates that GDP grew by about 4% in the second quarter. Growth is expected to slow to about 2% in the third quarter as consumption growth moderates and housing market activity pulls back following unsustainable strength during the pandemic.\nThe Bank expects Canada\u2019s economy to grow by 3\u00bd% in 2022, 1\u00be% in 2023, and 2\u00bd% in 2024. Economic activity will slow as global growth moderates and tighter monetary policy works its way through the economy. This, combined with the resolution of supply disruptions, will bring demand and supply back into balance and alleviate inflationary pressures. Global energy prices are also projected to decline. The July outlook has inflation starting to come back down later this year, easing to about 3% by the end of next year and returning to the 2% target by the end of 2024.\nWith the economy clearly in excess demand, inflation high and broadening, and more businesses and consumers expecting high inflation to persist for longer, the Governing Council decided to front-load the path to higher interest rates by raising the policy rate by 100 basis points today. The Governing Council continues to judge that interest rates will need to rise further, and the pace of increases will be guided by the Bank\u2019s ongoing assessment of the economy and inflation. Quantitative tightening continues and is complementing increases in the policy interest rate. The Governing Council is resolute in its commitment to price stability and will continue to take action as required to achieve the 2% inflation target.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is September 7, 2022. The Bank will publish its next full outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the MPR on October 26, 2022."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 1%, with the Bank Rate at 1\u00bc% and the deposit rate at 1%. The Bank is also ending reinvestment and will begin quantitative tightening (QT), effective April 25. Maturing Government of Canada bonds on the Bank\u2019s balance sheet will no longer be replaced and, as a result, the size of the balance sheet will decline over time.\nRussia\u2019s ongoing invasion of Ukraine is causing unimaginable human suffering and new economic uncertainty. Price spikes in oil, natural gas and other commodities are adding to inflation around the world. Supply disruptions resulting from the war are also exacerbating ongoing supply constraints and weighing on activity. These factors are the primary drivers of a substantial upward revision to the Bank\u2019s outlook for inflation in Canada.\nThe war in Ukraine is disrupting the global recovery, just as most economies are emerging from the impact of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. European countries are more directly impacted by confidence effects and supply dislocations caused by the war. China\u2019s economy is facing new COVID outbreaks and an ongoing correction in its property market. In the United States, domestic demand remains very strong and the US Federal Reserve has clearly indicated its resolve to use its monetary policy tools to control inflation. As policy stimulus is withdrawn, US growth is expected to moderate to a pace more in line with potential growth. Global financial conditions have tightened and volatility has increased. The Bank now forecasts global growth of about 3\u00bd% this year, 2\u00bd% in 2023 and 3\u00bc% in 2024.\nIn Canada, growth is strong and the economy is moving into excess demand. Labour markets are tight, and wage growth is back to its pre-pandemic pace and rising. Businesses increasingly report they are having difficulty meeting demand, and are able to pass on higher input costs by increasing prices. While the COVID-19 virus continues to mutate and circulate, high rates of vaccination have reduced its health and economic impacts. Growth looks to have been stronger in the first quarter than projected in January and is likely to pick up in the second quarter. Consumer spending is strengthening with the lifting of pandemic containment measures. Exports and business investment will continue to recover, supported by strong foreign demand and high commodity prices. Housing market activity, which has been exceptionally high, is expected to moderate.\nThe Bank forecasts that Canada\u2019s economy will grow by 4\u00bc% this year before slowing to 3\u00bc% in 2023 and 2\u00bc% in 2024. Robust business investment, labour productivity growth and higher immigration will add to the economy\u2019s productive capacity, while higher interest rates should moderate growth in domestic demand.\nCPI inflation in Canada is 5.7%, above the Bank\u2019s forecast in its January Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Inflation is being driven by rising energy and food prices and supply disruptions, in combination with strong global and domestic demand. Core measures of inflation have all moved higher as price pressures broaden. CPI inflation is now expected to average almost 6% in the first half of 2022 and remain well above the control range throughout this year. It is then expected to ease to about 2\u00bd% in the second half of 2023 and return to the 2% target in 2024. There is an increasing risk that expectations of elevated inflation could become entrenched. The Bank will use its monetary policy tools to return inflation to target and keep inflation expectations well-anchored.\nWith the economy moving into excess demand and inflation persisting well above target, the Governing Council judges that interest rates will need to rise further. The policy interest rate is the Bank\u2019s primary monetary policy instrument, and quantitative tightening will complement increases in the policy rate. The timing and pace of further increases in the policy rate will be guided by the Bank\u2019s ongoing assessment of the economy and its commitment to achieving the 2% inflation target.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is June 1, 2022. The Bank will publish its next full outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the MPR on July 13, 2022.\nA market notice providing operational details for QT will be published this morning on the Bank\u2019s web site."

The Bank is continuing its reinvestment phase, keeping its overall holdings of Government of Canada bonds on its balance sheet roughly constant until such time as it becomes appropriate to allow the size of its balance sheet to decline.\nThe unprovoked invasion of Ukraine by Russia is a major new source of uncertainty. Prices for oil and other commodities have risen sharply. This will add to inflation around the world, and negative impacts on confidence and new supply disruptions could weigh on global growth. Financial market volatility has increased. The situation remains fluid and we are following events closely.\nGlobal economic data has come in broadly in line with projections in the Bank\u2019s January Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Economies are emerging from the impact of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 more quickly than expected, although the virus continues to circulate and the possibility of new variants remains a concern. Demand is robust, particularly in the United States. Global supply bottlenecks remain challenging, although there are indications that some constraints have eased.\nEconomic growth in Canada was very strong in the fourth quarter of last year at 6.7%. This is stronger than the Bank\u2019s projection and confirms its view that economic slack has been absorbed. Both exports and imports have picked up, consistent with solid global demand. In January, the recovery in Canada\u2019s labour market suffered a setback due to the Omicron variant, with temporary layoffs in service sectors and elevated employee absenteeism. However, the rebound from Omicron now appears to be well in train: household spending is proving resilient and should strengthen further with the lifting of public health restrictions. Housing market activity is more elevated, adding further pressure to house prices. Overall, first-quarter growth is now looking more solid than previously projected.\nCPI inflation is currently at 5.1%, as expected in January, and remains well above the Bank\u2019s target range. Price increases have become more pervasive, and measures of core inflation have all risen. Poor harvests and higher transportation costs have pushed up food prices. The invasion of Ukraine is putting further upward pressure on prices for both energy and food-related commodities. All told, inflation is now expected to be higher in the near term than projected in January. Persistently elevated inflation is increasing the risk that longer-run inflation expectations could drift upwards. The Bank will use its monetary policy tools to return inflation to the 2% target and keep inflation expectations well-anchored.\nThe policy rate is the Bank\u2019s primary monetary policy instrument. As the economy continues to expand and inflation pressures remain elevated, the Governing Council expects interest rates will need to rise further. The Governing Council will also be considering when to end the reinvestment phase and allow its holdings of Government of Canada bonds to begin to shrink. The resulting quantitative tightening (QT) would complement increases in the policy interest rate. The timing and pace of further increases in the policy rate, and the start of QT, will be guided by the Bank\u2019s ongoing assessment of the economy and its commitment to achieving the 2% inflation target.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is April 13, 2022. The Bank will publish its next full outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the MPR at the same time."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of \u00bc\u00a0%, with the Bank Rate at \u00bd\u00a0% and the deposit rate at \u00bc\u00a0%. With overall economic slack now absorbed, the Bank has removed its exceptional forward guidance on its policy interest rate. The Bank is continuing its reinvestment phase, keeping its overall holdings of Government of Canada bonds roughly constant.\nThe global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is strong but uneven. The US economy is growing robustly while growth in some other regions appears more moderate, especially in China due to current weakness in its property sector. Strong global demand for goods combined with supply bottlenecks that hinder production and transportation are pushing up inflation in most regions. As well, oil prices have rebounded to well above pre-pandemic levels following a decline at the onset of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. Financial conditions remain broadly accommodative but have tightened with growing expectations that monetary policy will normalize sooner than was anticipated, and with rising geopolitical tensions. Overall, the Bank projects global GDP growth to moderate from 6\u00be\u00a0% in 2021 to about 3\u00bd\u00a0% in 2022 and 2023.\nIn Canada, GDP growth in the second half of 2021 now looks to have been even stronger than expected. The economy entered 2022 with considerable momentum, and a broad set of measures are now indicating that economic slack is absorbed. With strong employment growth, the labour market has tightened significantly. Job vacancies are elevated, hiring intentions are strong, and wage gains are picking up. Elevated housing market activity continues to put upward pressure on house prices.\nThe Omicron variant is weighing on activity in the first quarter. While its economic impact will depend on how quickly this wave passes, it is expected to be less severe than previous waves. Economic growth is then expected to bounce back and remain robust over the projection horizon, led by consumer spending on services, and supported by strength in exports and business investment. After GDP growth of 4\u00bd\u00a0% in 2021, the Bank expects Canada\u2019s economy to grow by 4% in 2022 and about 3\u00bd\u00a0% in 2023.\nCPI inflation remains well above the target range and core measures of inflation have edged up since October. Persistent supply constraints are feeding through to a broader range of goods prices and, combined with higher food and energy prices, are expected to keep CPI inflation close to 5% in the first half of 2022. As supply shortages diminish, inflation is expected to decline reasonably quickly to about 3% by the end of this year and then gradually ease towards the target over the projection period. Near-term inflation expectations have moved up, but longer-run expectations remain anchored on the 2% target. The Bank will use its monetary policy tools to ensure that higher near-term inflation expectations do not become embedded in ongoing inflation.\nWhile COVID-19 continues to affect economic activity unevenly across sectors, the Governing Council judges that overall slack in the economy is absorbed, thus satisfying the condition outlined in the Bank\u2019s forward guidance on its policy interest rate. The Governing Council therefore decided to end its extraordinary commitment to hold its policy rate at the effective lower bound. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects interest rates will need to increase, with the timing and pace of those increases guided by the Bank\u2019s commitment to achieving the 2% inflation target.\nThe Bank will keep its holdings of Government of Canada bonds on its balance sheet roughly constant at least until it begins to raise the policy interest rate. At that time, the Governing Council will consider exiting the reinvestment phase and reducing the size of its balance sheet by allowing roll-off of maturing Government of Canada bonds.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is March 2, 2022. The Bank will publish its next full outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the Monetary Policy Report on April 13, 2022."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of \u00bc percent, with the Bank Rate at \u00bd percent and the deposit rate at \u00bc percent. The Bank\u2019s extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate is being maintained. The Bank is continuing its reinvestment phase, keeping its overall holdings of Government of Canada bonds roughly constant.\nThe global economy continues to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic growth in the United States has accelerated, led by consumption, while growth in some other regions is moderating after a strong third quarter. Inflation has increased further in many countries, reflecting strong demand for goods amid ongoing supply disruptions. The new Omicron COVID-19 variant has prompted a tightening of travel restrictions in many countries and a decline in oil prices, and has injected renewed uncertainty. Accommodative financial conditions are still supporting economic activity.\nCanada\u2019s economy grew by about 5\u00bd percent in the third quarter, as expected. Together with a downward revision to the second quarter, this brings the level of GDP to about 1\u00bd percent below its level in the last quarter of 2019, before the pandemic began. Third-quarter growth was led by a rebound in consumption, particularly services, as restrictions were further eased and higher vaccination rates improved confidence. Persistent supply bottlenecks continued to inhibit growth in other components of GDP, including non-commodity exports and business investment.\nRecent economic indicators suggest the economy had considerable momentum into the fourth quarter. This includes broad-based job gains in recent months that have brought the employment rate essentially back to its pre-pandemic level.\u00a0 Job vacancies remain elevated and wage growth has also picked up. Housing activity had been moderating, but appears to be regaining strength, notably in resales. The devastating floods in British Columbia and uncertainties arising from the Omicron variant could weigh on growth by compounding supply chain disruptions and reducing demand for some services.\u00a0\nCPI inflation is elevated and the impact of global supply constraints is feeding through to a broader range of goods prices. The effects of these constraints on prices will likely take some time to work their way through, given existing supply backlogs. Gasoline prices, which had been a major factor pushing up CPI inflation, have recently declined. Meanwhile, core measures of inflation are little changed since September. The Bank continues to expect CPI inflation to remain elevated in the first half of 2022 and ease back towards 2 percent in the second half of the year. The Bank is closely watching inflation expectations and labour costs to ensure that the forces pushing up prices do not become embedded in ongoing inflation.\nThe Governing Council judges that in view of ongoing excess capacity, the economy continues to require considerable monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank\u2019s October projection, this happens sometime in the middle quarters of 2022. We will provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation target.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is January 26, 2022. The Bank will publish its full outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the Monetary Policy Report at the same time."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of \u00bc percent, with the Bank Rate at \u00bd percent and the deposit rate at \u00bc percent. The Bank\u2019s extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate is being maintained. The Bank is ending quantitative easing (QE) and moving into the reinvestment phase, during which it will purchase Government of Canada bonds solely to replace maturing bonds.\nThe global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing. Vaccines are proving highly effective against the virus, although their availability and distribution globally remain uneven and COVID variants pose risks to health and economic activity. In the face of strong global demand for goods, pandemic-related disruptions to production and transportation are constraining growth.\u00a0 Inflation rates have increased in many countries, boosted by these supply bottlenecks and by higher energy prices. While bond yields have risen in recent weeks, financial conditions remain accommodative and continue to support economic activity.\nThe Bank projects global GDP will grow by 6\u00bd percent in 2021 \u2013 a strong pace but less than projected in the July Monetary Policy Report (MPR) \u2013 and by 4\u00bc percent in 2022 and about 3\u00bd percent in 2023.\nIn Canada, robust economic growth has resumed, following a pause in the second quarter. Strong employment gains in recent months were concentrated in hard-to-distance sectors and among workers most affected by lockdowns. This has significantly reduced the very uneven impact of the pandemic on workers. As the economy reopens, it is taking time for workers to find the right jobs and for employers to hire people with the right skills. This is contributing to labour shortages in certain sectors, even as slack remains in the overall labour market.\nThe Bank now forecasts Canada\u2019s economy will grow by 5 percent this year before moderating to 4\u00bc percent in 2022 and 3\u00be percent in 2023. Demand is expected to be supported by strong consumption and business investment, and a rebound in exports as the US economy continues to recover. Housing activity has moderated, but is expected to remain elevated. On the supply side, shortages of manufacturing inputs, transportation bottlenecks, and difficulties in matching jobs to workers are limiting the economy\u2019s productive capacity. Although the impact and persistence of these supply factors are hard to quantify, the output gap is likely to be narrower than the Bank had forecast in July.\nThe recent increase in CPI inflation was anticipated in July, but the main forces pushing up prices \u2013 higher energy prices and pandemic-related supply bottlenecks \u2013 now appear to be stronger and more persistent than expected. Core measures of inflation have also risen, but by less than the CPI. The Bank now expects CPI inflation to be elevated into next year, and ease back to around the 2 percent target by late 2022. The Bank is closely watching inflation expectations and labour costs to ensure that the temporary forces pushing up prices do not become embedded in ongoing inflation.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Governing Council judges that in view of ongoing excess capacity, the economy continues to require considerable monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank\u2019s projection, this happens sometime in the middle quarters of 2022. In light of the progress made in the economic recovery, the Governing Council has decided to end quantitative easing and keep its overall holdings of Government of Canada bonds roughly constant.\nWe will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation target.\nA market notice outlining details of the reinvestment phase will be published on the Bank\u2019s web site at 10:30 am ET today.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is December 8, 2021. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on January 26, 2022."

The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate. This is reinforced and supplemented by the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing (QE) program, which is being maintained at a target pace of $2 billion per week.\nThe global economic recovery continued through the second quarter, led by strong US growth, and had solid momentum heading into the third quarter. However, supply chain disruptions are restraining activity in some sectors and rising cases of COVID-19 in many regions pose a risk to the strength of the global recovery. Financial conditions remain highly accommodative.\nIn Canada, GDP contracted by about 1 percent in the second quarter, weaker than anticipated in the Bank\u2019s July Monetary Policy Report (MPR). This largely reflects a contraction in exports, due in part to supply chain disruptions, especially in the auto sector. Housing market activity pulled back from recent high levels, largely as expected. Consumption, business investment and government spending all contributed positively to growth, with domestic demand growing at more than 3\u00a0percent. Employment rebounded through June and July, with hard-to-distance sectors hiring as public health restrictions eased. This is reducing unevenness in the labour market, although considerable slack remains and some groups \u2013 particularly low-wage workers \u2013 are still disproportionately affected. The Bank continues to expect the economy to strengthen in the second half of 2021, although the fourth wave of COVID-19 infections and ongoing supply bottlenecks could weigh on the recovery.\nCPI inflation remains above 3\u00a0percent as expected, boosted by base-year effects, gasoline prices, and pandemic-related supply bottlenecks. These factors pushing up inflation are expected to be transitory, but their persistence and magnitude are uncertain and will be monitored closely. Wage increases have been moderate to date, and medium-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored. Core measures of inflation have risen, but by less than the CPI.\nThe Governing Council judges that the Canadian economy still has considerable excess capacity, and that the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2\u00a0percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank\u2019s July projection, this happens in the second half of 2022. The Bank's QE program continues to reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve. Decisions regarding future adjustments to the pace of net bond purchases will be guided by Governing Council's ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of the recovery. We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is October 27, 2021.

Under this Act, which was approved by Parliament on June 29, 2021, the Bank will be responsible for supervising PSPs to protect end users and help ensure the safety and reliability of PSP services. As per the Act, the Bank will maintain a public registry of all regulated payment service providers and a regular reporting framework. Bank of Canada supervision will also ensure that PSPs mitigate their operational risk and safeguard end-user funds.\nReporting directly to the Governor, Mr. Morrow will lead the design and implementation of the Retail Payments Supervision (RPS) Framework, including ongoing consultations on the Bank\u2019s supervisory role as regulations are developed. He will build the leadership team tasked with fulfilling this new mandate and oversee planning and execution of risk monitoring of PSPs. The Executive Director role will also act as an independent reviewer of enforcement actions initiated by RPS staff and advise the Governor of the Bank of Canada on the evolution of risks related to PSPs and the retail payments landscape.\n\u201cThis new mandate for the Bank is an important responsibility,\u201d said Governor Macklem. \u201cThe payments eco-system in Canada and globally is evolving rapidly, with innovative new options and many new participants. Ron\u2019s expertise, experience and leadership will ensure that we undertake this new role on behalf of Canadians with the same rigour, dedication and professionalism that the Bank applies to all its mandated responsibilities.\u201d\nBorn in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Mr. Morrow first joined the Bank in 1992 and has worked in several different areas across the Bank\u2019s monetary policy, financial stability, and funds management functions. In 2010, he became Managing Director of the Funds Management and Banking Department, then Managing Director of the Financial Stability Department in 2013. Mr. Morrow became an Advisor to the Governor in 2018, focusing on advancing the Bank\u2019s strategic objectives related to retail payments, financial market infrastructure issues, and the efficiency of the Canadian financial system.

The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate. This is reinforced and supplemented by the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing (QE) program, which is being adjusted to a target pace of $2\u00a0billion per week. This adjustment reflects continued progress towards recovery and the Bank\u2019s increased confidence in the strength of the Canadian economic outlook.\nThe global economy is recovering strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic, with continued progress on vaccinations, particularly in advanced economies. However, the recovery is still highly uneven and remains dependent on the course of the virus. The recent spread of new COVID-19 variants is a growing concern, especially for regions where vaccination rates remain low.\u00a0\nGlobal GDP growth is expected to reach 7 percent this year and then moderate to about 4 \u00bd percent in 2022 and just over 3 percent in 2023. This is a slightly stronger forecast than the one in the Bank\u2019s April Monetary Policy Report (MPR) and primarily reflects a stronger US outlook. Global financial conditions remain highly accommodative. Rising demand is supporting higher oil prices, while non-energy commodity prices remain elevated. The Canada-US exchange rate is little changed since April.\nIn Canada, the third wave of the virus slowed growth in the second quarter. However, falling COVID-19 cases, progress on vaccinations and easing containment restrictions all point to a strong pickup in the second half of this year. The Bank now expects GDP growth of around 6 percent in 2021 \u2013 a little slower than was expected in April \u2013 but has revised up its 2022 forecast to 4\u00a0\u00bd percent and projects 3\u00a0\u00bc percent growth in 2023.\nConsumption is expected to lead the recovery as households return to more normal spending patterns, while housing market activity is projected to ease back from historical highs. Stronger international demand should underpin a solid recovery in exports. As domestic and foreign demand increases and confidence improves, business investment will gain strength. Employment has once again begun to rebound, and we expect the hardest-hit segments of the labour market to post strong gains as the economy re-opens. However, the pace of the recovery will vary among industries and workers, and it could take some time to hire workers with the right skills to fill jobs. The aftermath of lockdowns and ongoing structural changes in the economy both mean that estimates of potential output and when the output gap will close are particularly uncertain.\nCPI inflation was 3.6 percent in May, boosted by temporary factors that include base-year effects and stronger gasoline prices, as well as pandemic-related bottlenecks as economies re-open. Core measures of inflation have also risen but by less than the CPI. In some high-contact services, demand is rebounding faster than supply, pushing up prices from low levels. Transitory supply constraints in shipping and value chain disruptions for semiconductors are also translating into higher prices for cars and some other goods. With higher gasoline prices and on-going supply bottlenecks, inflation is likely to remain above 3 percent through the second half of this year and ease back toward 2 percent in 2022, as short-run imbalances diminish and the considerable overall slack in the economy pulls inflation lower. The factors pushing up inflation are transitory, but their persistence and magnitude are uncertain and will be monitored closely.\nThe Governing Council judges that the Canadian economy still has considerable excess capacity, and that the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank\u2019s July projection, this happens sometime in the second half of 2022. The Bank's QE program continues to reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve.

The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance, reinforced and supplemented by its quantitative easing (QE) program, which continues at its current pace of at least $4 billion per week.\nThe global economy is recovering from the economic effects of COVID-19, albeit with ongoing unevenness across regions and sectors. The US economic recovery appears to be gaining momentum as virus infections decline and fiscal support boosts incomes and consumption. New fiscal stimulus will increase US consumption and output growth further. Global yield curves have steepened, largely reflecting the improved US growth outlook, but global financial conditions remain highly accommodative. Oil and other commodity prices have risen. The Canadian dollar has been relatively stable against the US dollar, but has appreciated against most other currencies.\nIn Canada, the economy is proving to be more resilient than anticipated to the second wave of the virus and the associated containment measures.\u00a0 Although activity in hard-to-distance sectors continues to be held back, recent data point to continued recovery in the rest of the economy. GDP grew 9.6% in the final quarter of 2020, led by strong inventory accumulation. GDP growth in the first quarter of 2021 is now expected to be positive, rather than the contraction forecast in January. Consumers and businesses are adapting to containment measures, and housing market activity has been much stronger than expected. Improving foreign demand and higher commodity prices have also brightened the prospects for exports and business investment.\nDespite the stronger near-term outlook, there is still considerable economic slack and a great deal of uncertainty about the evolution of the virus and the path of economic growth. The labour market is a long way from recovery, with employment still well below pre-COVID levels. Low-wage workers, young people and women have borne the brunt of the job losses. The spread of more transmissible variants of the virus poses the largest downside risk to activity, as localized outbreaks and restrictions could restrain growth and add choppiness to the recovery.\nCPI inflation is near the bottom of the 1-3 percent target band but is likely to move temporarily to around the top of the band in the next few months. The expected rise in CPI inflation reflects base-year effects from deep price declines in some goods and services at the outset of the crisis a year ago, combined with higher gasoline prices pushed up by the recent run-up in oil prices. CPI inflation is then expected to moderate as base-year effects dissipate and excess capacity continues to exert downward pressure. Measures of core inflation currently range from 1.3 to 2 percent.\u00a0\nWhile economic prospects have improved, the Governing Council judges that the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank\u2019s January projection, this does not happen until into 2023. To reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve, the Bank will continue its QE program until the recovery is well underway.\u00a0 As the Governing Council continues to gain confidence in the strength of the recovery, the pace of net purchases of Government of Canada bonds will be adjusted as required. We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is April 21, 2021.

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of \u00bc percent, with the Bank Rate at \u00bd percent and the deposit rate at \u00bc percent. The Bank continues to provide extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate, reinforced and supplemented by the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing (QE) program. Effective the week of April 26, weekly net purchases of Government of Canada bonds will be adjusted to a target of $3 billion. This adjustment to the amount of incremental stimulus being added each week reflects the progress made in the economic recovery.\nThe outlook has improved for both the global and Canadian economies. Activity has proven more resilient than expected in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rollout of vaccines is progressing. A number of regions, including Canada, are experiencing a difficult third wave of infections and lockdowns. The more contagious variants of the virus are straining healthcare systems and affecting hard-to-distance activities, and have introduced a new dimension of uncertainty. The recovery remains highly dependent on the evolution of the pandemic and the pace of vaccinations.\nGlobal economic growth is stronger than was forecast in the January Monetary Policy Report (MPR), although the pace varies considerably across countries. After a contraction of 2\u00a0\u00bd percent in 2020, the Bank now projects global GDP to grow by just over 6\u00a0\u00be percent in 2021, about 4 percent in 2022, and almost 3\u00a0\u00bd percent in 2023. The recovery in the United States has been particularly strong, owing to fiscal stimulus and rapid vaccine rollouts. The global recovery has lifted commodity prices, including oil, contributing to the strength of the Canadian dollar.\nIn Canada, growth in the first quarter appears considerably stronger than the Bank\u2019s January forecast, as households and companies adapted to the second wave and associated restrictions. Substantial job gains in February and March boosted employment. However, new lockdowns will pose another setback and the labour market remains difficult for many Canadians, especially low-wage workers, young people and women. As vaccines roll out and the economy reopens, consumption is expected to rebound strongly in the second half of this year and remain robust over the projection. Housing construction and resales are at historic highs, driven by the desire for more living space, low mortgage rates, and limited supply. The Bank will continue to monitor the potential risks associated with the rapid rise in house prices. Meanwhile, strong growth in foreign demand and higher commodity prices are expected to drive a robust recovery in exports and business investment. Additional federal and provincial fiscal stimulus will contribute importantly to growth. The Bank now forecasts real GDP growth of 6\u00a0\u00bd percent in 2021, moderating to around 3\u00a0\u00be percent in 2022 and 3\u00a0\u00bc percent in 2023.\nThe Bank has revised up its estimate of potential output in light of greater resilience to the pandemic and accelerated digitalization. The virus and lockdowns have had very different impacts across sectors, businesses, and groups of workers, creating an unusual degree of uncertainty about the amount of slack in the economy and how long it will take to be absorbed. To gauge the evolution of slack, the Bank will look at a broad spectrum of indicators, including various measures of labour market conditions.\nOver the next few months, inflation is expected to rise temporarily to around the top of the 1-3 percent inflation-control range. This is largely the result of base-year effects\u2014year-over-year CPI inflation is higher because prices of some goods and services fell sharply at the start of the pandemic. In addition, the increase in oil prices since December has driven gasoline prices above their pre-pandemic levels. The Bank expects CPI inflation to ease back toward 2 percent over the second half of 2021 as these base-year effects diminish, and inflation is expected to ease further because of the ongoing drag from excess capacity. As slack is absorbed, inflation should return to 2 per cent on a sustained basis some time in the second half of 2022.\u00a0\nEven as economic prospects improve, the Governing Council judges that there is still considerable excess capacity, and the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. Based on the Bank\u2019s latest projection, this is now expected to happen some time in the second half of 2022. The Bank is continuing its QE program to reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve. Decisions regarding further adjustments to the pace of net purchases will be guided by Governing Council\u2019s ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of the recovery. We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is June 9, 2021. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on July 14, 2021."

The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance, reinforced and supplemented by its quantitative easing (QE) program, which continues at its current pace of at least $4 billion per week.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to take a severe human and economic toll in Canada and around the world. The earlier-than anticipated arrival of effective vaccines will save lives and livelihoods, and has reduced uncertainty from extreme levels. Nevertheless, uncertainty is still elevated, and the outlook remains highly conditional on the path of the virus and the timeline for the effective rollout of vaccines.\u00a0\nThe economic recovery has been interrupted in many countries as new waves of COVID-19 infections force governments to re-impose containment measures. However, the arrival of effective vaccines combined with further fiscal and monetary policy support have boosted the medium-term outlook for growth. In its January Monetary Policy Report (MPR), the Bank projects global growth to average just over 5 percent per year in 2021 and 2022, before slowing to just under 4 percent in 2023. Global financial markets and commodity prices have reacted positively to improving economic prospects. A broad-based decline in the US exchange rate combined with stronger commodity prices have led to a further appreciation of the Canadian dollar.\nCanada\u2019s economy had strong momentum through to late 2020, but the resurgence of cases and the reintroduction of lockdown measures are a serious setback. Growth in the first quarter of 2021 is now expected to be negative. Assuming restrictions are lifted later in the first quarter, the Bank expects a strong second-quarter rebound. Consumption is forecast to gain strength as parts of the economy reopen and confidence improves, and exports and business investment will be buoyed by rising foreign demand. Beyond the near term, the outlook for Canada is now stronger and more secure than in the October projection, thanks to earlier-than-expected availability of vaccines and significant ongoing policy stimulus. After a decline in real GDP of 5\u00a0\u00bd percent in 2020, the Bank projects the economy will grow by 4 percent in 2021, almost 5 percent in 2022, and around 2\u00a0\u00bd percent in 2023.\nCPI inflation has risen to the low end of the Bank\u2019s 1-3 percent target range in recent months, while measures of core inflation are still below 2 percent. CPI inflation is forecast to rise temporarily to around 2 percent in the first half of the year, as the base-year effects of price declines at the pandemic\u2019s outset \u2014 mostly gasoline \u2014 dissipate. Excess supply is expected to weigh on inflation throughout the projection period. As it is absorbed, inflation is expected to return sustainably to the 2 percent target in 2023.\nIn view of the weakness of near-term growth and the protracted nature of the recovery, the Canadian economy will continue to require extraordinary monetary policy support. The Governing Council will hold the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In our projection, this does not happen until into 2023. To reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve, the Bank will continue its QE program until the recovery is well underway.\u00a0 As the Governing Council gains confidence in the strength of the recovery, the pace of net purchases of Government of Canada bonds will be adjusted as required. We remain committed to providing the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is March 10, 2021. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on April 21, 2021.\nAs announced, starting with this decision the target for the overnight rate will take effect on the business day following each rate announcement."

The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance, reinforced and supplemented by its quantitative easing (QE) program, which continues at its current pace of at least $4 billion per week.\nThe rebound in the global and Canadian economies has unfolded largely as the Bank had anticipated in its October Monetary Policy Report (MPR). More recently, news on the development of effective vaccines is providing reassurance that the pandemic will end and more normal activities will resume, although the pace and breadth of the global rollout of vaccinations remain uncertain. Near term, new waves of infections are expected to set back recoveries in many parts of the world. Accommodative policy and financial conditions are continuing to provide support across most regions. Stronger demand is pushing up prices for most commodities, including oil. A broad-based decline in the US exchange rate has contributed to a further appreciation of the Canadian dollar.\nIn Canada, national accounts data for the third quarter were consistent with the Bank\u2019s expectations of a sharp economic rebound following the precipitous decline in the second quarter. The labour market continues to recoup the jobs that were lost at the start of the pandemic, albeit at a slower pace. However, activity remains highly uneven across different sectors and groups of workers. Economic momentum heading into the fourth quarter appears to be stronger than was expected in October but, in recent weeks, record high cases of COVID-19 in many parts of Canada are forcing re-imposition of restrictions. This can be expected to weigh on growth in the first quarter of 2021 and contribute to a choppy trajectory until a vaccine is widely available. The federal government\u2019s recently announced measures should help maintain business and household incomes during this second wave of the pandemic and support the recovery.\u00a0\nCPI inflation in October picked up to 0.7 percent, largely reflecting higher prices for fresh fruits and vegetables. While this suggests a slightly firmer track for inflation in the fourth quarter, the outlook for inflation remains in line with the October MPR projection. Measures of core inflation are all below 2 percent, and considerable economic slack is expected to continue to weigh on inflation for some time.\u00a0\nCanada\u2019s economic recovery will continue to require extraordinary monetary policy support.

The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance, reinforced and supplemented by its quantitative easing (QE) program. The Bank is recalibrating the QE program to shift purchases towards longer-term bonds, which have more direct influence on the borrowing rates that are most important for households and businesses. At the same time, total purchases will be gradually reduced to at least $4 billion a week. The Governing Council judges that, with these combined adjustments, the QE program is providing at least as much monetary stimulus as before.\nThe global and Canadian economic outlooks have evolved largely as anticipated in the July Monetary Policy Report (MPR), with rapid expansions as economies reopened giving way to slower growth, despite considerable remaining excess capacity. Looking ahead, rising COVID-19 infections are likely to weigh on the economic outlook in many countries, and growth will continue to rely heavily on policy support.\nIn the United States, GDP growth rebounded strongly but appears to be slowing considerably. China\u2019s economic output is back to pre-pandemic levels and its recovery continues to broaden. Emerging-market economies have been hit harder, especially those with severe outbreaks. The recovery in Europe is slowing amid mounting lockdowns. Overall, global GDP is projected to contract by about 4 percent in 2020 before growing by just over 4 \u00bd percent, on average, in 2021\u201322.\nOil prices remain about 30 percent below pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, non-energy commodity prices, on average, have more than fully recovered. Despite continued low oil prices, the Canadian dollar has appreciated since July, largely reflecting a broad-based depreciation of the US dollar.\u00a0\nIn Canada, the rebound in employment and GDP was stronger than expected as the economy reopened through the summer. The economy is now transitioning to a more moderate recuperation phase. In the fourth quarter, growth is expected to slow markedly, due in part to rising COVID-19 case numbers. The economic effects of the pandemic are highly uneven across sectors and are particularly affecting low-income workers. Recognizing these challenges, governments have extended and modified business and income support programs.\nAfter a decline of about 5 \u00bd percent in 2020, the Bank expects Canada\u2019s economy to grow by almost 4 percent on average in 2021 and 2022. Growth will likely be choppy as domestic demand is influenced by the evolution of the virus and its impact on consumer and business confidence. Considering the likely long-lasting effects of the pandemic, the Bank has revised down its estimate of Canada\u2019s potential growth over the projection horizon.\nCPI inflation was at 0.5 percent in September and is expected to stay below the Bank\u2019s target band of 1 to 3 percent until early 2021, largely due to low energy prices. Measures of core inflation are all below 2 percent, consistent with an economy where demand has fallen by more than supply. Inflation is expected to remain below target throughout the projection horizon.\nAs the economy recuperates, it will continue to require extraordinary monetary policy support. The Governing Council will hold the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In our current projection, this does not happen until into 2023. The Bank is continuing its QE program and recalibrating it as described above. The program will continue until the recovery is well underway. We are committed to providing the monetary policy stimulus needed to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is December 9, 2020.

As well as helping central banks to meet their public policy objectives, the report provides a useful framework for how central banks provide money and support payment systems in an ever-evolving digital world. This group of central banks has built a strong international consensus which will help light the way as we each explore the case and design for CBDCs in our own jurisdictions,\u201d said working group co-chair Sir Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England and Chair of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures.\nBased on these principles, the group has identified the core features of any future CBDC system, which must be:\n\u201cA design that delivers these features can promote more resilient, efficient, inclusive and innovative payments.

We still have a lot of work to do before deciding to issue a CBDC in Canada. As we investigate this, we welcome engagement from the private sector and civil society since our CBDC would have to meet the needs of all Canadians.\u201d\nFurther development of CBDCs requires a commitment to practical policy analysis and applied technical experimentation. While this has already started, the speed of innovation in payments and money-related technologies requires the prioritisation of collaborative experimentation.\n\u201cWhile technology is changing the way we pay, central banks have a duty to safeguard people\u2019s trust in our money. Central banks must complement their domestic efforts with close cooperation to guide the exploration of central bank digital currencies to identify reliable principles and encourage innovation. The present report is a convincing proof of this international cooperation,\u201d said Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, who chairs the group of central bank governors responsible for the report.\nFuture activities will include exploring other open questions around CBDCs and the challenges of cross-border payments, as well as continuing outreach domestically and with other central banks to foster informed dialogue on key issues.

The Bank is also continuing its quantitative easing (QE) program, with large-scale asset purchases of at least $5 billion per week of Government of Canada bonds.\nBoth the global and Canadian economies are evolving broadly in line with the scenario in the July Monetary Policy Report (MPR), with activity bouncing back as countries lift containment measures. The Bank continues to expect this strong reopening phase to be followed by a protracted and uneven recuperation phase, which will be heavily reliant on policy support. The pace of the recovery remains highly dependent on the path of the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolution of social distancing measures required to contain its spread.\nThe rebound in the United States has been stronger than expected, while economic performance among emerging markets has been more mixed. Global financial conditions have remained accommodative.

Core funding markets are functioning well, and this has led to a decline in the use of the Bank\u2019s short-term liquidity programs. Monetary policy is working to support household spending and business investment by making borrowing more affordable.\nHousehold spending rebounded sharply over the summer, with stronger-than-expected goods consumption and housing activity largely reflecting pent-up demand. There has also been a large but uneven rebound in employment. Exports are recovering in response to strengthening foreign demand, but are still well below pre-pandemic levels. Business confidence and investment remain subdued. While recent data during the reopening phase is encouraging, the Bank continues to expect the recuperation phase to be slow and choppy as the economy copes with ongoing uncertainty and structural challenges.\nCPI inflation is close to zero, with downward pressure from energy prices and travel services, and is expected to remain well below target in the near term. Measures of core inflation are between 1.3\u00a0percent and 1.9\u00a0percent, reflecting the large degree of economic slack, with the core measure most influenced by services prices showing the weakest growth.\nAs the economy moves from reopening to recuperation, it will continue to require extraordinary monetary policy support. The Governing Council will hold the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. To reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve, the Bank is continuing its large-scale asset purchase program at the current pace. This QE program will continue until the recovery is well underway and will be calibrated to provide the monetary policy stimulus needed to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is October\u00a028,\u00a02020. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."

The Bank Rate is correspondingly \u00bd percent and the deposit rate is \u00bc percent. The Bank is also continuing its quantitative easing (QE) program, with large-scale asset purchases of at least $5 billion per week of Government of Canada bonds. The Bank\u2019s short-term liquidity programs announced since March to improve market functioning are having their intended effect and, with reduced market strains, their use has declined. The provincial and corporate bond purchase programs will continue as announced. The Bank stands ready to adjust its programs if market conditions warrant.\nWhile economies are re-opening, the global and Canadian outlook is extremely uncertain, given the unpredictability of the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reflecting this, the Bank\u2019s July Monetary Policy Report (MPR) presents a central scenario for global and Canadian growth rather than the usual economic projections. The central scenario is based on assumptions outlined in the MPR, including that there is no widespread second wave of the virus.\nAfter a sharp drop in the first half of 2020, global economic activity is picking up. This return to growth reflects the relaxation of necessary containment measures put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus, combined with extraordinary fiscal and monetary policy support. As a result, financial conditions have improved. The prices of most commodities, including oil, have risen from very low levels. In the central scenario, the global economy overall shrinks by about 5 percent in 2020 and then grows by around 5 percent on average in 2021 and 2022. The timing and pace of the recovery varies among regions and could be hampered by a resurgence of infections and the limited capacity of some countries to contain the virus or support their economies.\nThe Canadian economy is starting to recover as it re-opens from the shutdowns needed to limit the virus spread. With economic activity in the second quarter estimated to have been 15 percent below its level at the end of 2019, this is the deepest decline in economic activity since the Great Depression, but considerably less severe than the worst scenarios presented in the April MPR. Decisive and necessary fiscal and monetary policy actions have supported incomes and kept credit flowing, cushioning the fall and laying the foundation for recovery. Since early June, the government has announced additional support programs, and extended others.\nThere are early signs that the reopening of businesses and pent-up demand are leading to an initial bounce-back in employment and output. In the central scenario, roughly 40 percent of the collapse in the first half of the year is made up in the third quarter. Subsequently, the Bank expects the economy\u2019s recuperation to slow as the pandemic continues to affect confidence and consumer behaviour and as the economy works through structural challenges. As a result, in the central scenario, real GDP declines by 7.8 percent in 2020 and resumes with growth of 5.1 percent in 2021 and 3.7 percent in 2022. The Bank expects economic slack to persist as the recovery in demand lags that of supply, creating significant disinflationary pressures.\nCPI inflation is close to zero, pulled down by sharp declines in components such as gasoline and travel services. The Bank\u2019s core measures of inflation have drifted down, although by much less than the CPI, and are now between 1.4 and 1.9 percent. Inflation is expected to remain weak before gradually strengthening toward 2 percent as the drag from low gas prices and other temporary effects dissipates and demand recovers, reducing economic slack.\u00a0\nAs the economy moves from reopening to recuperation, it will continue to require extraordinary monetary policy support. The Governing Council will hold the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In addition, to reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve, the Bank is continuing its large-scale asset purchase program at a pace of at least $5 billion per week of Government of Canada bonds. This QE program is making borrowing more affordable for households and businesses and will continue until the recovery is well underway. To support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective, the Bank is prepared to provide further monetary stimulus as needed.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is September 9, 2020.

The Bank Rate is correspondingly \u00bd percent and the deposit rate is \u00bc percent.\nIncoming data confirm the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy. This impact appears to have peaked, although uncertainty about how the recovery will unfold remains high. Massive policy responses in advanced economies have helped to replace lost income and cushion the effect of economic shutdowns. Financial conditions have improved, and commodity prices have risen in recent weeks after falling sharply earlier this year. Because different countries\u2019 containment measures will be lifted at different times, the global recovery likely will be protracted and uneven. \u00a0\nIn Canada, the pandemic has led to historic losses in output and jobs. Still, the Canadian economy appears to have avoided the most severe scenario presented in the Bank\u2019s April Monetary Policy Report (MPR). The level of real GDP in the first quarter was 2.1 percent lower than in the fourth quarter of 2019. This GDP reading is in the middle of the Bank\u2019s April monitoring range and reflects the combined impact of falling oil prices and widespread shutdowns. The level of real GDP in the second quarter will likely show a further decline of 10-20 percent, as continued shutdowns and sharply lower investment in the energy sector take a further toll on output. Decisive and targeted fiscal actions, combined with lower interest rates, are buffering the impact of the shutdown on disposable income and helping to lay the foundation for economic recovery. While the outlook for the second half of 2020 and beyond remains heavily clouded, the Bank expects the economy to resume growth in the third quarter.\nCPI inflation has decreased to near zero, as anticipated in the April MPR, mainly due to lower prices for gasoline. The Bank expects temporary factors to keep CPI inflation below the target band in the near term. The Bank\u2019s core measures of inflation have drifted down, although by much less than the CPI, and are now between 1.6 and 2 percent.\nThe Bank\u2019s programs to improve market function are having their intended effect. After significant strains in March, short-term funding conditions have improved. Therefore, the Bank is reducing the frequency of its term repo operations to once per week, and its program to purchase bankers\u2019 acceptances to bi-weekly operations. The Bank stands ready to adjust these programs if market conditions warrant. Meanwhile, its other programs to purchase federal, provincial, and corporate debt are continuing at their present frequency and scope.\nAs market function improves and containment restrictions ease, the Bank\u2019s focus will shift to supporting the resumption of growth in output and employment. The Bank maintains its commitment to continue large-scale asset purchases until the economic recovery is well underway. Any further policy actions would be calibrated to provide the necessary degree of monetary policy accommodation required to achieve the inflation target.\nTiff Macklem assumes his role as the Bank\u2019s tenth Governor today. He participated as an observer in Governing Council\u2019s deliberations for this policy interest rate decision and endorses the rate decision and measures announced in this press release.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is July 15, 2020.

The Bank Rate is correspondingly \u00bd percent and the deposit rate is \u00bc percent. The Bank also announced new measures to provide additional support to Canada\u2019s financial system.\nThe necessary efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic have caused a sudden and deep contraction in economic activity and employment worldwide. In financial markets, this has driven a flight to safety and a sharp repricing of a wide range of assets. It has also pushed down prices for commodities, especially oil. In this environment, the Canadian dollar has depreciated since January, although by less than many other currencies. The sudden halt in global activity will be followed by regional recoveries at different times, depending on the duration and severity of the outbreak in each region. This means that the global economic recovery, when it comes, could be protracted and uneven.\nThe Canadian economy was in a solid position ahead of the COVID-19 outbreak, but has since been hit by widespread shutdowns and lower oil prices. One early measure of the extent of the damage was an unprecedented drop in employment in March, with more than one million jobs lost across Canada. Many more workers reported shorter hours, and by early April some six million Canadians had applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nThe outlook is too uncertain at this point to provide a complete forecast. However, Bank analysis of alternative scenarios suggests the level of real activity was down 1-3 percent in the first quarter of 2020, and will be 15-30 percent lower in the second quarter than in fourth-quarter 2019. CPI inflation is expected to be close to 0 percent in the second quarter of 2020. This is primarily due to the transitory effects of lower gasoline prices.\nThe pandemic-driven contraction has prompted decisive policy action to support individuals and businesses and to lay the foundation for economic recovery once containment measures start to ease. Fiscal programs, designed to expand according to the magnitude of the shock, will help individuals and businesses weather this shutdown phase of the pandemic, and support incomes and confidence leading into the recovery. These programs have been complemented by actions taken by other federal agencies and provincial governments.\nFor its part, the Bank of Canada has taken measures to improve market function so that monetary policy actions have their intended effect on the economy. This helps ensure that households and businesses continue to have access to the credit they need to bridge this difficult time, and that lower interest rates find their way to ultimate borrowers. The Bank has lowered its target for the overnight rate 150 basis points over the last three weeks, to its effective lower bound. It has also conducted lending operations to financial institutions and asset purchases in core funding markets amounting to around $200 billion.\nThese actions have served to ease market dysfunction and help keep credit channels open, although they remain strained. The next challenge for markets will be managing increased demand for near-term financing by federal and provincial governments, and businesses and households. The situation calls for special actions by the central bank. To this end, the Bank is furthering its efforts with several important steps.\nUnder its previously-announced program, the Bank will continue to purchase at least $5 billion in Government of Canada securities per week in the secondary market, and will increase the level of purchases as required to maintain proper functioning of the government bond market. Also, the Bank is temporarily increasing the amount of Treasury Bills it acquires at auctions to up to 40 percent, effective immediately.\nThe Bank is also announcing today the development of a new Provincial Bond Purchase Program of up to $50 billion, to supplement its Provincial Money Market Purchase Program. Further, the Bank is announcing a new Corporate Bond Purchase Program, in which the Bank will acquire up to a total of $10 billion in investment grade corporate bonds in the secondary market. Both of these programs will be put in place in the coming weeks. Finally, the Bank is further enhancing its term repo facility to permit funding for up to 24 months.\nThese measures will work in combination to ease pressure on Canadian borrowers. As containment restrictions are eased and economic activity resumes, fiscal and monetary policy actions will help underpin confidence and stimulate spending by consumers and businesses to restore growth. The Bank\u2019s Governing Council stands ready to adjust the scale or duration of its programs if necessary. All the Bank\u2019s actions are aimed at helping to bridge the current period of containment and create the conditions for a sustainable recovery and achievement of the inflation target over time.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is June 3, 2020. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on July 15, 2020."

The pandemic-driven contraction has prompted decisive fiscal policy action in Canada to support individuals and businesses and to minimize any permanent damage to the structure of the economy.\nThe Bank is playing an important complementary role in this effort. Its interest rate setting cushions the impact of the shocks by easing the cost of borrowing. Its efforts to maintain the functioning of the financial system are helping keep credit available to people and companies. The intent of our decision today is to support the financial system in its central role of providing credit in the economy, and to lay the foundation for the economy\u2019s return to normalcy.\nThe Bank\u2019s efforts have been primarily focused on ensuring the availability of credit by providing liquidity to help markets continue to function.\u00a0 To promote credit availability, the Bank has expanded its various term repo facilities. To preserve market function, the Bank is conducting Government of Canada bond buybacks and switches, purchases of Canada Mortgage Bonds and banker\u2019s acceptances, and purchases of provincial money market instruments. All these additional measures have been detailed on the Bank\u2019s website and will be extended or augmented as needed.\nToday, the Bank is launching two new programs.\nFirst, the Commercial Paper Purchase Program (CPPP) will help to alleviate strains in short-term funding markets and thereby preserve a key source of funding for businesses. Details of the program will be available on the Bank\u2019s web site.\nSecond, to address strains in the Government of Canada debt market and to enhance the effectiveness of all other actions taken so far, the Bank will begin acquiring Government of Canada securities in the secondary market. Purchases will begin with a minimum of $5 billion per week, across the yield curve. The program will be adjusted as conditions warrant, but will continue until the economic recovery is well underway. The Bank\u2019s balance sheet will expand as a result of these purchases.\nThe Bank is closely monitoring economic and financial conditions, in coordination with other G7 central banks and fiscal authorities, and will update its outlook in mid-April. As the situation evolves, Governing Council stands ready to take further action as required to support the Canadian economy and financial system and to keep inflation on target.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is April 15, 2020.

However, COVID-19 represents a significant health threat to people in a growing number of countries. In consequence, business activity in some regions has fallen sharply and supply chains have been disrupted. This has pulled down commodity prices and the Canadian dollar has depreciated. Global markets are reacting to the spread of the virus by repricing risk across a broad set of assets, making financial conditions less accommodative. It is likely that as the virus spreads, business and consumer confidence will deteriorate, further depressing activity.\nIn Canada, GDP growth slowed to 0.3 percent during the fourth quarter of 2019, in line with the Bank\u2019s forecast, although its composition was different. Consumption was stronger than expected, supported by healthy labour income growth. Residential investment continued to grow, albeit at a more moderate pace than earlier in the year. Meanwhile, both business investment and exports weakened.\nIt is becoming clear that the first quarter of 2020 will be weaker than the Bank had expected. The drop in Canada\u2019s terms of trade, if sustained, will weigh on income growth. Meanwhile, business investment does not appear to be recovering as was expected following positive trade policy developments. In addition, rail line blockades, strikes by Ontario teachers, and winter storms in some regions are dampening economic activity in the first quarter.\nCPI inflation in January was stronger than expected, due to temporary factors. Core measures of inflation all remain around 2 percent, consistent with an economy that has been operating close to potential.\nIn light of all these developments, the outlook is clearly weaker now than it was in January. As the situation evolves, Governing Council stands ready to adjust monetary policy further if required to support economic growth and keep inflation on target. While markets continue to function well, the Bank will continue to ensure that the Canadian financial system has sufficient liquidity.\nThe Bank continues to closely monitor economic and financial conditions, in coordination with other G7 central banks and fiscal authorities.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is April 15, 2020. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1\u00a0\u00be percent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 2 percent and the deposit rate is 1\u00a0\u00bd percent.\nEvidence has been accumulating that ongoing trade tensions are having a material effect on the global economic outlook. The Bank had already incorporated such negative effects in previous Monetary Policy Reports (MPR) and in this forecast has made further adjustments in light of weaker sentiment and activity in major economies. Trade conflicts between the United States and China, in particular, are curbing manufacturing activity and business investment and pushing down commodity prices.\nPolicy is responding to the slowdown: central banks in the US and Europe have signalled their readiness to provide more accommodative monetary policy and further policy stimulus has been implemented in China. In this context, global financial conditions have eased substantially. The Bank now expects global GDP to grow by 3 percent in 2019 and to strengthen to around 3\u00a0\u00bc percent in 2020 and 2021, with the US slowing to a pace near its potential. Escalation of trade conflicts remains the biggest downside risk to the global and Canadian outlooks.\nFollowing temporary weakness in late 2018 and early 2019, Canada\u2019s economy is returning to growth around potential, as expected. Growth in the second quarter appears to be stronger than predicted due to some temporary factors, including the reversal of weather-related slowdowns in the first quarter and a surge in oil production. Consumption is being supported by a healthy labour market. At the national level, the housing market is stabilizing, although there are still significant adjustments underway in some regions. A material decline in longer-term mortgage rates is supporting housing activity. Exports rebounded in the second quarter and will grow moderately as foreign demand continues to expand. However, ongoing trade conflicts and competitiveness challenges are dampening the outlook for trade and investment. The Bank projects real GDP growth to average 1.3 percent in 2019 and about 2 percent in 2020 and 2021.\nInflation remains around the 2 percent target, with some recent upward pressure from higher food and automobile prices. Core measures of inflation are also close to 2 percent. CPI inflation will likely dip this year because of the dynamics of gasoline prices and some other temporary factors. As slack in the economy is absorbed and these temporary effects wane, inflation is expected to return sustainably to 2 percent by mid-2020.\nRecent data show the Canadian economy is returning to potential growth. However, the outlook is clouded by persistent trade tensions. Taken together, the degree of accommodation being provided by the current policy interest rate remains appropriate. As Governing Council continues to monitor incoming data, it will pay particular attention to developments in the energy sector and the impact of trade conflicts on the prospects for Canadian growth and inflation.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is September 4, 2019. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on October 30, 2019."

The Bank Rate is correspondingly 2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1\u00a0\u00bd per cent.\nThe global economic expansion is moderating largely as expected, but signs are emerging that trade conflicts are weighing more heavily on global demand. Recent encouraging developments at the G20 meetings are a reminder that there are upside as well as downside risks around trade policy. Growth in major advanced economies has slowed, although activity in the United States remains above potential.\nOil prices have fallen sharply since the October Monetary Policy Report (MPR), reflecting a combination of geopolitical developments, uncertainty about global growth prospects, and expansion of U.S. shale oil production. Benchmarks for western Canadian oil \u2013 both heavy and, more recently, light \u2013 have been pulled down even further by transportation constraints and a buildup of inventories. In light of these developments and associated cutbacks in production, activity in Canada\u2019s energy sector will likely be materially weaker than expected.\nThe Canadian economy as a whole grew in line with the Bank\u2019s projection in the third quarter, although data suggest less momentum going into the fourth quarter. Business investment fell in the third quarter, in large part due to heightened trade uncertainty during the summer. Business investment outside the energy sector is expected to strengthen with the signing of the USMCA, new federal government tax measures, and ongoing capacity constraints. Along with strong foreign demand, this increase in productive capacity should support continued growth in exports.\nHousehold credit and regional housing markets appear to be stabilizing following a significant slowdown in recent quarters. The Bank continues to monitor the impact on both builders and buyers of tighter mortgage rules, regional housing policy changes, and higher interest rates.\nInflation has been evolving as expected and the Bank\u2019s core measures are all tracking 2 per cent, consistent with an economy that has been operating close to its capacity. CPI inflation, at 2.4 per cent in October, is just above target but is expected to ease in coming months by more than the Bank had previously forecast, due to lower gasoline prices. Downward historical revisions by Statistics Canada to GDP, together with recent macroeconomic developments, indicate there may be additional room for non-inflationary growth. The Bank will reassess all of these factors in its new projection for the January MPR.\nWeighing all of these developments, Governing Council continues to judge that the policy interest rate will need to rise into a neutral range to achieve the inflation target. The appropriate pace of rate increases will depend on a number of factors. These include the effect of higher interest rates on consumption and housing, and global trade policy developments. The persistence of the oil price shock, the evolution of business investment, and the Bank\u2019s assessment of the economy\u2019s capacity will also factor importantly into our decisions about the future stance of monetary policy.\u00a0\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is January 9, 2019. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."

Wilkins.\nEach quarter, our staff conduct an in-depth analysis of the Canadian and international economies and present it to Governing Council. The projections combine real-time data and forecasts for key macroeconomic indicators, such as real GDP and its components, consumer price inflation, the output gap, the unemployment rate and the implied policy rate path running through the staff projection. Governing Council take these projections, apply their own judgment and adjust them, and ultimately develop their own consensus forecast for the Canadian and global economies, as depicted in the MPR.\nThe series in this database are published with a five-year lag, with annual updates to follow.

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 1 \u00be per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1 \u00bd per cent.\nThe global economic outlook remains solid. The US economy is especially robust and is expected to moderate over the projection horizon, as forecast in the Bank\u2019s July Monetary Policy Report (MPR). The new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will reduce trade policy uncertainty in North America, which has been an important curb on business confidence and investment. However, trade conflict, particularly between the United States and China, is weighing on global growth and commodity prices. Financial market volatility has resurfaced and some emerging markets are under stress but, overall, global financial conditions remain accommodative.\nThe Canadian economy continues to operate close to its potential and the composition of growth is more balanced. Despite some quarterly fluctuations, growth is expected to average about 2 per cent over the second half of 2018. Real GDP is projected to grow by 2.1 per cent this year and next before slowing to 1.9 per cent in 2020.\nThe projections for business investment and exports have been revised up, reflecting the USMCA and the recently-approved liquid natural gas project in British Columbia. Still, investment and exports will be dampened by the recent decline in commodity prices, as well as ongoing competitiveness challenges and limited transportation capacity. The Bank will be monitoring the extent to which the USMCA leads to more confidence and business investment in Canada.\nHousehold spending is expected to continue growing at a healthy pace, underpinned by solid employment income growth. Households are adjusting their spending as expected in response to higher interest rates and housing market policies. In this context, household credit growth continues to moderate and housing activity across Canada is stabilizing. As a result, household vulnerabilities are edging lower in a number of respects, although they remain elevated. \u00a0\nCPI inflation dropped to 2.2 per cent in September, in large part because the summer spike in airfares was reversed. Other temporary factors pushing up inflation, such as past increases in gasoline prices and minimum wages, should fade in early 2019. Inflation is then expected to remain close to the 2 per cent target through the end of 2020. The Bank\u2019s core measures of inflation all remain around 2 per cent, consistent with an economy that is operating at capacity. Wage growth remains moderate, although it is projected to pick up in the coming quarters, consistent with the Bank\u2019s latest Business Outlook Survey.\nGiven all of these factors, Governing Council agrees that the policy interest rate will need to rise to a neutral stance to achieve the inflation target. In determining the appropriate pace of rate increases, Governing Council will continue to take into account how the economy is adjusting to higher interest rates, given the elevated level of household debt. In addition, we will pay close attention to global trade policy developments and their implications for the inflation outlook. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is December 5, 2018. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on January 9, 2019."

The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 \u00be per cent and the deposit rate is 1 \u00bc per cent.\nCPI inflation moved up to 3 per cent in July. This was higher than expected, in large part because of a jump in the airfare component of the consumer price index. The Bank expects CPI inflation to move back towards 2 per cent in early 2019, as the effects of past increases in gasoline prices dissipate. The Bank\u2019s core measures of inflation remain firmly around 2 per cent, consistent with an economy that has been operating near capacity for some time. Wage growth remains moderate.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nRecent data on the global economy have been consistent with the Bank\u2019s July Monetary Policy Report (MPR) projections. The US economy is particularly robust, with strong consumer spending and business investment. Elevated trade tensions remain a key risk to the global outlook and are pulling some commodity prices lower. Meanwhile, financial stresses have intensified in certain emerging market economies, but with limited spillovers to other countries.\nThe Canadian economy is evolving closely in line with the Bank\u2019s July projection for growth to average near potential. Following growth of 1.4 per cent in the first quarter, GDP rebounded by 2.9 per cent in the second quarter, as the Bank had forecast. GDP growth is expected to slow temporarily in the third quarter, mainly because of further fluctuations in energy production and exports.\nWhile uncertainty about trade policies continues to weigh on businesses, the rotation of demand towards business investment and exports is proceeding. Despite choppiness in the data, both business investment and exports have been growing solidly for several quarters. Meanwhile, activity in the housing market is beginning to stabilize as households adjust to higher interest rates and changes in housing policies. Continuing gains in employment and labour income are helping to support consumption. As past interest rate increases work their way through the economy, credit growth has moderated and the household debt-to-income ratio is beginning to edge down.\nRecent data reinforce Governing Council\u2019s assessment that higher interest rates will be warranted to achieve the inflation target. We will continue to take a gradual approach, guided by incoming data. In particular, the Bank continues to gauge the economy\u2019s reaction to higher interest rates. The Bank is also monitoring closely the course of NAFTA negotiations and other trade policy developments, and their impact on the inflation outlook.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is October 24, 2018. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 1 \u00bd per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 \u00be per cent and the deposit rate is 1 \u00bc per cent.\nThe Bank expects the global economy to grow by about 3 \u00be per cent in 2018 and 3 \u00bd per cent in 2019, in line with the April Monetary Policy Report (MPR). The US economy is proving stronger than expected, reinforcing market expectations of higher policy rates and pushing up the US dollar. This is contributing to financial stresses in some emerging market economies. Meanwhile, oil prices have risen. Yet, the Canadian dollar is lower, reflecting broad-based US dollar strength and concerns about trade actions. The possibility of more trade protectionism is the most important threat to global prospects.\nCanada\u2019s economy continues to operate close to its capacity and the composition of growth is shifting. Temporary factors are causing volatility in quarterly growth rates: the Bank projects a pick-up to 2.8 per cent in the second quarter and a moderation to 1.5 per cent in the third. Household spending is being dampened by higher interest rates and tighter mortgage lending guidelines. Recent data suggest housing markets are beginning to stabilize following a weak start to 2018. Meanwhile, exports are being buoyed by strong global demand and higher commodity prices. Business investment is growing in response to solid demand growth and capacity pressures, although trade tensions are weighing on investment in some sectors. Overall, the Bank still expects average growth of close to 2 per cent over 2018-2020.\nCPI and the Bank\u2019s core measures of inflation remain near 2 per cent, consistent with an economy operating close to capacity. CPI inflation is expected to edge up further to about 2.5 per cent before settling back to 2 per cent by the second half of 2019. The Bank estimates that underlying wage growth is running at about 2.3 per cent, slower than would be expected in a labour market with no slack.\nAs in April, the projection incorporates an estimate of the impact of trade uncertainty on Canadian investment and exports. This effect is now judged to be larger, given mounting trade tensions.\nThe July projection also incorporates the estimated impact of tariffs on steel and aluminum recently imposed by the United States, as well as the countermeasures enacted by Canada. Although there will be difficult adjustments for some industries and their workers, the effect of these measures on Canadian growth and inflation is expected to be modest.\nGoverning Council expects that higher interest rates will be warranted to keep inflation near target and will continue to take a gradual approach, guided by incoming data. In particular, the Bank is monitoring the economy\u2019s adjustment to higher interest rates and the evolution of capacity and wage pressures, as well as the response of companies and consumers to trade actions.\u00a0\n\u00a0The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is September 5, 2018. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on October 24, 2018."

The Bank of Canada will be an AI Stream partner and participate in both the CDL-Toronto and CDL-Montreal programs for a three-year period. The partnership will allow Bank staff to better understand these technologies and their applications. In addition, the Bank plans to leverage the CDL program by inviting participating experts to share their knowledge with staff.\n\u201cThe Bank is delighted to collaborate with the world-class experts at CDL as part of our digital economy agenda,\u201d said Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins. \u201cThis partnership aligns perfectly with our core goals of leveraging technology to enhance the quality and breadth of our research and analysis and increasing the efficiency of the Bank\u2019s operations.\u201d\n\u201cWhile a collaboration between a central bank and a high-tech university start-up program may seem counterintuitive, we are convinced that the skills and assets each of us bring will result in a highly productive partnership that will enhance Canadian competitiveness,\u201d says Sonia Sennik, Executive Director of the CDL.\nThe Creative Destruction Lab is a seed-stage program for massively scalable, science-based companies that works with world-class entrepreneurs, scientists and investors as well as university students to bring the best ideas in the technology field to market.

        "text": "High household indebtedness and housing market imbalances remain the most important vulnerabilities identified by the Bank of Canada in its Financial System Review (FSR), published today. While these vulnerabilities remain elevated, policy measures continue to improve the resilience of the financial system.\nThe vulnerability related to high household indebtedness has begun to ease. Incomes continue to rise and household credit growth has slowed due to higher interest rates and policy measures aimed at mortgage financing and housing. Because of the sheer size of the stock of debt, however, this vulnerability will persist for some time.\nHouse price growth has also slowed, led by a decline in the Greater Toronto Area. The condominium markets in the Toronto and Vancouver areas remain strong, with some evidence of speculative activity. Overall, the vulnerability associated with housing market imbalances has shown signs of lessening but remains elevated.\n\u201cThe two main vulnerabilities we have been watching closely are showing continued signs of easing, which is encouraging,\u201d said Governor Stephen S. Poloz. \u201cCombined, the impact of higher interest rates and the changes to the mortgage guidelines have reduced credit growth and improved the quality of new lending.\u201d\nThe third main vulnerability highlighted in the FSR concerns cyber threats to an interconnected financial system. The Bank has been working with the major banks and Payments Canada to ensure Canada\u2019s key payment systems are able to recover quickly should a cyber attack be successful. \u201cContinued collaboration and a greater pooling of resources are needed to increase the overall resilience of the financial system,\u201d said the Governor.\nThe key risk scenarios that apply to these vulnerabilities are similar to those in the November 2017 FSR, as is the level of risk that any of these scenarios might materialize. The most important risk is a severe nationwide recession leading to a rise in financial stress. Other key risks are a house price correction in overheated markets and a sharp increase in long-term interest rates driven by higher global risk premiums.\nThe Bank is also modernizing the way it communicates and engages with Canadians on financial stability issues. \u201cThis autumn, we will launch a new financial system hub on our website, where we will publish timely and accessible research and analysis throughout the year,\u201d said Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn A. Wilkins. As well, a member of Governing Council will deliver a speech each autumn to provide an update on the Bank\u2019s assessment of the vulnerabilities and risks to the financial system. The FSR will now be published once a year, in June, and the quarterly Monetary Policy Report will include more in-depth discussion of relevant financial system issues, as warranted.\nThis issue of the FSR also features three reports written by Bank of Canada staff:"

The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1\u00bd per cent and the deposit rate is 1 per cent.\nGlobal economic activity remains broadly on track with the Bank\u2019s April Monetary Policy Report (MPR) forecast. Recent data point to some upside to the outlook for the US economy. At the same time, ongoing uncertainty about trade policies is dampening global business investment and stresses are developing in some emerging market economies. Global oil prices have been higher than assumed in April, in part reflecting geopolitical developments.\nInflation in Canada has been close to the 2 per cent target and will likely be a bit higher in the near term than forecast in April, largely because of recent increases in gasoline prices. Core measures of inflation remain near 2 per cent, consistent with an economy operating close to potential. As usual, the Bank will look through the transitory impact of fluctuations in gasoline prices.\nIn Canada, economic data since the April MPR have, on balance, supported the Bank\u2019s outlook for growth around 2 per cent in the first half of 2018. Activity in the first quarter appears to have been a little stronger than projected. \u00a0Exports of goods were more robust than forecast, and data on imports of machinery and equipment suggest continued recovery in investment. Housing resale activity has remained soft into the second quarter, as the housing market continues to adjust to new mortgage guidelines and higher borrowing rates. Going forward, solid labour income growth supports the expectation that housing activity will pick up and consumption will continue to contribute importantly to growth in 2018.\nOverall, developments since April further reinforce Governing Council\u2019s view that higher interest rates will be warranted to keep inflation near target. Governing Council will take a gradual approach to policy adjustments, guided by incoming data. In particular, the Bank will continue to assess the economy\u2019s sensitivity to interest rate movements and the evolution of economic capacity.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is July 11, 2018.

The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 \u00bd per cent and the deposit rate is 1 per cent.\nInflation in Canada is close to 2 per cent as temporary factors that have been weighing on inflation have largely dissipated, as expected. Consistent with an economy operating with little slack, core measures of inflation have continued to edge up and are all now close to 2 per cent. The transitory impact of higher gasoline prices and recent minimum wage increases will likely cause inflation in 2018 to be modestly higher than the Bank expected in its January Monetary Policy Report (MPR), returning to the 2 per cent target for the rest of the projection horizon.\nThe global economy is on a modestly stronger track than forecast in January, with upward revisions to growth and potential output in a number of major advanced economies. The outlook for the U.S. economy has been further boosted by new government spending plans. However, escalating geopolitical and trade conflicts risk undermining the global expansion.\nIn Canada, GDP growth in the first quarter was weaker than the Bank had expected, but should rebound in the second quarter, resulting in 2 per cent average growth in the first half of 2018. The economy is projected to operate slightly above its potential over the next three years, with real GDP growth of about 2 per cent in both 2018 and 2019, and 1.8 per cent in 2020. This stronger profile for GDP incorporates new provincial and federal fiscal measures announced since January. It also reflects upward revisions to estimates of potential output growth, which suggest the Canadian economy has made some progress in building capacity.\nSlower economic growth in the first quarter primarily reflects weakness in two areas. Housing markets responded to new mortgage guidelines and other policy measures by pulling forward transactions to late 2017. Exports also faltered, partly owing to transportation bottlenecks. Some of the weakness in housing and exports is expected to be unwound as 2018 progresses.\nThe Bank anticipates that Canadian exports will strengthen as foreign demand increases, but not sufficiently to recover the ground lost during recent quarters. Export growth is being increasingly limited by capacity constraints in some sectors. Continued gains in business investment should build additional capacity in those sectors and in the economy more generally. However, both exports and investment are being held back by ongoing competitiveness challenges and uncertainty about trade policies.\nGrowth in consumption remains robust, supported by strong labour income growth. Wages have continued to pick up as expected, even after factoring out recent minimum wage increases in Ontario and Alberta. The Bank will continue to assess labour market data for signs of remaining slack.\nSome progress has been made on the key issues being watched closely by Governing Council, particularly the dynamics of inflation and wage growth. This progress reinforces Governing Council\u2019s view that higher interest rates will be warranted over time, although some monetary policy accommodation will still be needed to keep inflation on target. The Bank will also continue to monitor the economy\u2019s sensitivity to interest rate movements and the evolution of economic capacity. In this context, Governing Council will remain cautious with respect to future policy adjustments, guided by incoming data.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is May 30, 2018. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on July 11, 2018."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1 per cent.\nGlobal growth remains solid and broad-based. In the United States, new government spending and previously-announced tax cuts are anticipated to boost growth in 2018 and 2019. However, trade policy developments are an important and growing source of uncertainty for the global and Canadian outlooks.\nIn Canada, the national accounts data show that the economy grew by 3 per cent in 2017, bringing the level of real GDP in line with the projection in the Bank\u2019s January Monetary Policy Report (MPR). In the fourth quarter, GDP growth was slower than expected, largely due to higher imports, while exports made only a partial recovery from their third-quarter decline. The gain in imports mainly reflected stronger business investment, which adds to the economy\u2019s capacity.\nStrong housing data in late 2017, and softer data at the beginning of this year, indicate some pulling forward of demand ahead of new mortgage guidelines and other policy measures. It will take some time to fully assess the impact of these, as well as recently announced provincial measures, on housing demand and prices. More broadly, the Bank continues to monitor the economy\u2019s sensitivity to higher interest rates. Notably, household credit growth has decelerated for three consecutive months. The implications of the recent federal budget for the outlook for growth and inflation will be incorporated in the Bank\u2019s April projection.\nInflation is running close to the 2 per cent target and the Bank\u2019s core measures of inflation have edged up, consistent with an economy operating near capacity. Wage growth has firmed, but remains lower than would be typical in an economy with no labour market slack. Inflation is fluctuating because of temporary factors related to gasoline, electricity, and minimum wages.\nIn this context, Governing Council maintained the target for the overnight rate at 1 1/4 per cent. While the economic outlook is expected to warrant higher interest rates over time, some continued monetary policy accommodation will likely be needed to keep the economy operating close to potential and inflation on target. Governing Council will remain cautious in considering future policy adjustments, guided by incoming data in assessing the economy\u2019s sensitivity to interest rates, the evolution of economic capacity, and the dynamics of both wage growth and inflation.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is April 18, 2018. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."

Removing legal tender status from these older notes is expected to have little impact on most Canadians, as these denominations have not been produced in decades and are rarely used in transactions. Importantly, removal of legal tender status does not mean these notes will lose their face value; the Bank of Canada will continue to honour them.\nIf the government is granted this power, the Bank of Canada will provide clear information to Canadians on how to redeem the affected bank notes. This will involve a period during which the notes can be redeemed through financial institutions\u2014as Canadians can do today.

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 1 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1 per cent. Recent data have been strong, inflation is close to target, and the economy is operating roughly at capacity. However, uncertainty surrounding the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is clouding the economic outlook.\nThe global economy continues to strengthen, with growth expected to average 3 1/2 per cent over the projection horizon. Growth in advanced economies is projected to be stronger than in the Bank\u2019s October Monetary Policy Report (MPR). In particular, there are signs of increasing momentum in the US economy, which will be boosted further by recent tax changes. Global commodity prices are higher, although the benefits to Canada are being diluted by wider spreads between benchmark world and Canadian oil prices.\nIn Canada, real GDP growth is expected to slow to 2.2 per cent in 2018 and 1.6 per cent in 2019, following an estimated 3.0 per cent in 2017. Growth is expected to remain above potential through the first quarter of 2018 and then slow to a rate close to potential for the rest of the projection horizon.\nConsumption and residential investment have been stronger than anticipated, reflecting strong employment growth. Business investment has been increasing at a solid pace, and investment intentions remain positive. Exports have been weaker than expected although, apart from cross-border shifts in automotive production, there have been positive signs in most other categories.\nLooking forward, consumption and residential investment are expected to contribute less to growth, given higher interest rates and new mortgage guidelines, while business investment and exports are expected to contribute more. The Bank\u2019s outlook takes into account a small benefit to Canada\u2019s economy from stronger US demand arising from recent tax changes. However, as uncertainty about the future of NAFTA is weighing increasingly on the outlook, the Bank has incorporated into its projection additional negative judgement on business investment and trade.\nThe Bank continues to monitor the extent to which strong demand is boosting potential, creating room for more non-inflationary expansion. In this respect, capital investment, firm creation, labour force participation, and hours worked are all showing promising signs. Recent data show that labour market slack is being absorbed more quickly than anticipated. Wages have picked up but are rising by less than would be typical in the absence of labour market slack.\nIn this context, inflation is close to 2 per cent and core measures of inflation have edged up, consistent with diminishing slack in the economy. The Bank expects CPI inflation to fluctuate in the months ahead as various temporary factors (including gasoline and electricity prices) unwind. Looking through these temporary factors, inflation is expected to remain close to 2 per cent over the projection horizon.\nWhile the economic outlook is expected to warrant higher interest rates over time, some continued monetary policy accommodation will likely be needed to keep the economy operating close to potential and inflation on target. Governing Council will remain cautious in considering future policy adjustments, guided by incoming data in assessing the economy\u2019s sensitivity to interest rates, the evolution of economic capacity, and the dynamics of both wage growth and inflation.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is March 7, 2018. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on April 18, 2018."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent.\nThe global economic recovery is entering a new phase. In advanced economies, temporary factors supporting growth in 2010 - such as the inventory cycle and pent-up demand - have largely run their course and fiscal stimulus will shift to fiscal consolidation over the projection horizon. While the Bank expects that private demand in advanced economies will become sufficiently entrenched to sustain the recovery, the combination of difficult labour market dynamics and ongoing deleveraging in many advanced economies is expected to moderate the pace of growth relative to prior expectations. These factors will contribute to a weaker-than-projected recovery in the United States in particular. Growth in emerging-market economies is expected to ease to a more sustainable pace as fiscal and monetary policies are tightened. Heightened tensions in currency markets and related risks associated with global imbalances could result in a more protracted and difficult global recovery.\nThe economic outlook for Canada has changed. The Bank expects the economic recovery to be more gradual than it had projected in its July Monetary Policy Report, with growth of 3.0 per cent in 2010, 2.3 per cent in 2011, and 2.6 per cent in 2012. This more modest growth profile reflects a more gradual global recovery and a more subdued profile for household spending. With housing activity declining markedly as anticipated and household debt considerations becoming more important, the Bank expects household expenditures to decelerate to a pace closer to the rate of income growth over the projection horizon. Overall, the composition of demand in Canada is expected to shift away from government and household expenditures towards business investment and net exports. The strength of net exports will be sensitive to currency movements, the expected recovery in productivity growth, and the prospects for external demand.\nInflation in Canada has been slightly below the Bank\u2019s July projection. The recent moderation in core inflation is consistent with the persistence of significant excess supply and a deceleration in the growth of unit labour costs. The Bank judges that the output gap is slightly larger and that the economy will return to full capacity by the end of 2012 rather than the beginning of that year, as had been anticipated in July. The inflation outlook has been revised down and both total CPI and core inflation are now expected to converge to 2 per cent by the end of 2012, as excess supply in the economy is gradually absorbed and inflation expectations remain well-anchored.\nReflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. This leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in an environment of significant excess supply in Canada.\nAt this time of transition in the global recovery, with a weaker U.S. outlook, constraints beginning to moderate growth in emerging-market economies, and domestic considerations that are expected to slow consumption and housing activity in Canada, any further reduction in monetary policy stimulus would need to be carefully considered.\nA full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on 20 October 2010. The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 7 December 2010."

While these vulnerabilities are still elevated, improving economic conditions and recent changes to housing policy should support an easing of these vulnerabilities over time.\n\u201cOur financial system continues to be resilient, and is being bolstered by stronger growth and job creation, but we need to continue to watch financial vulnerabilities closely,\u201d said Governor Stephen S. Poloz.\nWhile household debt relative to income continues to rise, there have been notable shifts in mortgage activity over the past year, including an improvement in the quality of new high-ratio mortgages (those with a down payment of less than 20 per cent).\nAt the same time, some indicators suggest increasing risks associated with new low-ratio mortgages, such as a greater proportion of these mortgages being issued to highly indebted households. Recent changes to guidelines for low-ratio mortgages will take effect in January 2018 and are expected to mitigate some of these risks over time.\nThe Bank of Canada continues to monitor housing market imbalances closely, particularly for signs of extrapolative expectations. In both the Greater Toronto Area and the Greater Vancouver Area, economic fundamentals, combined with limited supply, continue to support house price growth. However, housing policy measures, together with higher mortgage rates, are expected to weigh on housing activity.\nA third vulnerability highlighted in the FSR concerns cyber threats and the interconnectedness of the financial system. Through the Bank\u2019s oversight of critical financial market infrastructures, it imposes high standards for risk resilience. In this context, the Bank is working with industry and public sector partners to reinforce the resilience of core payment systems and to ensure that key financial system participants can recover quickly in the event of a cyberattack.\nThe risk scenarios summarized in this FSR are the same as in June.\nThe November issue also features two reports written by Bank of Canada staff:"

In the United States, the recovery in private demand is being held back by high unemployment and recent indicators suggest a more muted recovery in the near term.\nEconomic activity in Canada was slightly softer in the second quarter than the Bank had expected, although consumption and investment have evolved largely as anticipated.\u00a0 Going forward, consumption growth is expected to remain solid and business investment to rise strongly. Both are being supported by accommodative credit conditions, which have eased in recent weeks mainly owing to sharp declines in global bond yields.\nThe Bank now expects the economic recovery in Canada to be slightly more gradual than it had projected in its July Monetary Policy Report (MPR), largely reflecting a weaker profile for U.S. activity. Inflation in Canada has been broadly in line with the Bank's expectations and its dynamics are essentially unchanged.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Bank decided to increase its target for the overnight rate to 1 per cent. As a result of monetary policy measures taken since April, financial conditions in Canada have tightened modestly but remain exceptionally stimulative. This is consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in an environment of significant excess supply in Canada.\nAny further reduction in monetary policy stimulus would need to be carefully considered in light of the unusual uncertainty surrounding the outlook.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 19 October 2010.

The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/2 per cent.\nThe global economic recovery is proceeding but is not yet self-sustaining. Greater emphasis on balance sheet repair by households, banks, and governments in a number of advanced economies is expected to temper the pace of global growth relative to the Bank's outlook in its April Monetary Policy Report (MPR). While the policy response to the European sovereign debt crisis has reduced the risk of an adverse outcome and increased the prospect of sustainable long term growth, it is expected to slow the global recovery over the projection horizon. In the United States, private demand is picking up but remains uneven.\nEconomic activity in Canada is unfolding largely as expected, led by government and consumer spending. Housing activity is declining markedly from high levels, consistent with the Bank's view that policy stimulus resulted in household expenditures being brought forward into late 2009 and early 2010. While employment growth has resumed, business investment appears to be held back by global uncertainties and has yet to recover from its sharp contraction during the recession.\nThe Bank expects the economic recovery in Canada to be more gradual than it had projected in its April MPR, with growth of 3.5 per cent in 2010, 2.9 per cent in 2011, and 2.2 per cent in 2012. This revision reflects a slightly weaker profile for global economic growth and more modest consumption growth in Canada. The Bank anticipates that business investment and net exports will make a relatively larger contribution to growth.\nInflation in Canada has been broadly in line with the Bank's April projection. While the Bank now expects the economy to return to full capacity at the end of 2011, two quarters later than had been anticipated in April, the underlying dynamics for inflation are little changed. Both total CPI and core inflation are expected to remain near 2 per cent throughout the projection period. The Bank will look through the transitory effects on inflation of changes to provincial indirect taxes.\nReflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to raise the target for the overnight rate to 3/4 per cent. This decision leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in light of the significant excess supply in Canada, the strength of domestic spending, and the uneven global recovery.\nGiven the considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook, any further reduction of monetary stimulus would have to be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic developments.\nA full update of the Bank's outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on 22 July 2010.

        "text": "Household indebtedness and housing market imbalances\u2014the most important vulnerabilities for the Canadian financial system\u2014have moved higher over the past six months, the Bank of Canada said today in its Financial System Review (FSR). However, \u201cthe financial system remains resilient, and macroeconomic conditions continue to improve,\u201d said Governor Stephen S. Poloz.\nHousehold indebtedness has continued to rise in Canada, driven in large part by growth in mortgage lending in the Toronto and Vancouver areas. Recent federal government measures are improving credit quality in the insured mortgage market. At the same time, the share of uninsured mortgages is increasing, especially in markets with high house prices, with some mortgages showing riskier characteristics.\nImbalances in the Canadian housing market have also grown since December, mainly due to an acceleration in prices in Toronto and surrounding areas. While strong fundamentals are supporting price growth in both the Toronto and Vancouver areas, extrapolative expectations are also playing an important role. Macroprudential and housing policy measures are, however, expected to help mitigate this vulnerability over time.\nIn this FSR, the Bank assesses two separate risk scenarios related to these vulnerabilities.\nThe first risk scenario focuses on the financial stability implications of an externally generated severe recession, where a nationwide correction in house prices is only one of the channels through which the economy and the financial system are affected. A rise in unemployment and a decline in household income would impair the ability of some households to service their debts, potentially generating broad financial system and economic stress. This risk has a low probability of materializing, but would have a severe impact should it occur. Improving macroeconomic conditions have reduced the probability of this risk occurring.\nThe second risk scenario looks more narrowly at a significant house price correction in Toronto, Vancouver and their surrounding areas. A decline in house prices in these areas would be unlikely to generate the kind of widespread rise in unemployment and fall in business profitability assumed in the first risk scenario. As a result, while the likelihood of this second risk scenario materializing is higher than that of the first, its impact would be less severe.\nOther risks highlighted in the FSR are a sharp increase in long-term interest rates driven by higher global risk premiums and stress emanating from China or other emerging-market economies. The risk of prolonged weakness in commodity prices, which was rated as low in the December 2016 FSR, has now been removed. The economy\u2019s adjustment to lower oil prices is largely complete, and the financial system has been able to manage the negative effects on households and businesses in commodity-producing regions.\nThe June issue also features three reports written by Bank of Canada staff:\n* first published on 25 May 2017"

Total CPI inflation remains near the bottom of the target range, reflecting year-over-year price declines for consumer energy products. Core inflation has been close to 2 per cent, with disinflationary pressures from economic slack being offset by transitory effects of the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar and some sector-specific factors. The dynamics of GDP growth in Canada outlined in July\u2019s MPR also remain intact. The stimulative effects of previous monetary policy actions are working their way through the Canadian economy.\nCanada\u2019s resource sector continues to adjust to lower prices for oil and other commodities, with some spillover to the rest of the economy. These adjustments are complex and are expected to take considerable time. Economic activity continues to be underpinned by solid household spending and a firm recovery in the United States, with particular strength in the sectors of the U.S. economy that are important for Canadian exports.\nIncreasing uncertainty about growth prospects for China and other emerging-market economies, in contrast, is raising questions about the pace of the global recovery. This has contributed to heightened financial market volatility and lower commodity prices. Movements in the Canadian dollar are helping to absorb some of the impact of lower commodity prices and are facilitating the adjustments taking place in Canada\u2019s economy. While the overall export picture is still uncertain, the latest data confirm that exchange rate-sensitive exports are regaining momentum.\nMeanwhile, risks to financial stability are evolving as expected. Taking all of these developments into consideration, the Bank judges that the risks to the outlook for inflation remain within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate. Therefore, the target for the overnight rate remains at 1/2 per cent.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 21 October 2015. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."

Five different landscapes representing the various regions of Canada are featured on the other side of the note: the Lions/Twin Sisters (Western Canada), a wheat field (Prairie provinces), the Canadian Shield (Central Canada), Cape Bonavista (Eastern Canada) and the Northern lights (Northern Canada).\nThe commemorative $10 note also has new security features, including a colour-shifting arch depicting an arch found in the Memorial Chamber on Parliament Hill, as well as three-dimensional maple leaves.\nA comprehensive consultation process was undertaken by the Bank to ensure that this commemorative bank note reflects the input of Canadians. The ideas and suggestions received through public opinion research, consultation and focus groups influenced the note\u2019s content and have been carefully incorporated into the design.\nStarting in June, the Bank of Canada will issue 40 million of these commemorative bank notes and distribute them through financial institutions to be broadly available across Canada by 1 July.\nThe Canada 150 note will circulate alongside the current Polymer series $10 note, but it does not replace it. Both the current $10 note and the commemorative $10 note are of equal value and can be used interchangeably in transactions.\nAs announced in December, human rights and freedoms icon Viola Desmond will be featured on a new $10 note, which will mark another historic first: Desmond will become the first Canadian woman to be featured on a regularly circulating Bank of Canada bank note, expected in late 2018.\nNotes to Editors:"

        "text": "The overall level of risk to Canada\u2019s financial system remains largely unchanged from six months ago, the Bank of Canada said today in the Financial System Review (FSR). The Bank continues to highlight two key vulnerabilities related to Canadian households: high levels of indebtedness and housing market imbalances. A third ongoing vulnerability is the potential for fragility in fixed-income market liquidity.\nNonetheless, the Canadian financial system remains resilient as the nation\u2019s economy improves and financial reforms in Canada and worldwide progress.\nSince June, the proportion of highly indebted households has continued to rise in many cities, notably in the Greater Toronto Area. Nationally, house prices continue to increase relative to income, although significant regional divergences persist. Imbalances in some regional housing markets make it more likely that adverse economic shocks could cause large declines in prices.\nThis buildup of vulnerabilities will be mitigated over time by new federal housing finance rules and other housing sector policies, which will dampen activity in the sector and improve the quality of new mortgages. While the impact of these measures will be concentrated in regions where house prices are the highest relative to income, such as Vancouver, Toronto and Calgary, they will also have important effects at a national level.\n\u201cThese macroprudential policies will raise the underlying quality of household indebtedness over time, as well as financial institutions\u2019 capital requirements and pricing criteria, which will make them more resilient to future shocks,\u201d Governor Stephen S. Poloz said. \u201cAccordingly, these policies will help mitigate financial stability risks over time.\u201d\nIn view of the household vulnerabilities identified in the FSR, the most important risk remains household financial stress and a sharp correction in house prices, triggered by a large and persistent nationwide rise in unemployment. The likelihood of this risk materializing, however, remains low.\nOther key risks are a sharp increase in long-term interest rates driven by higher global risk premiums, stress emanating from China and emerging-market economies, and prolonged weakness in commodity prices.\nThe December issue also features three reports written by Bank of Canada staff:"

        "text": "The primary objective of Canada's monetary policy is to enhance the  well-being of Canadians by contributing to sustained economic growth, rising  levels of employment and improved living standards. Experience has clearly shown  that the best way monetary policy can achieve this goal is by giving Canadian  households and businesses confidence in the value of their money.\nIt has been 15 years since Canada adopted an inflation-targeting framework to  guide its monetary policy. During this time, Consumer Price Index (CPI)  inflation has been reduced to a low, stable and predictable level of close to 2  per cent, real output has expanded at an average rate of 3 per cent per year and  the unemployment rate has fallen to 30-year lows. Although a generally  supportive international environment, coupled with significant domestic economic  reforms and a prudent fiscal policy track, has played an important role in these  positive developments, a key contributor has been Canada's monetary policy under  the inflation-targeting framework. The joint commitment of the Government of  Canada and the Bank of Canada to the inflation targets has helped anchor  inflation expectations. It has also provided a more stable and certain economic  environment in which Canadians can make their investment and spending  decisions.\nBased on this positive experience, the Government of Canada and the Bank of  Canada agree to renew the inflation target on the following basis:\nThe Bank will continue its ongoing research into potential improvements in  the monetary policy framework. Before the end of 2011, the Government and the  Bank will review the experience over the period and the results of the research,  and determine the appropriate target for the years ahead.\nThe commitment by the Government and the Bank to this inflation-control  target will ensure that Canadians continue to derive the economic and social  benefits from low, stable and predictable inflation and will underpin confidence  in Canada's economic prospects in the coming years.\nFor further information, media may contact:"

This worldwide effort was coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and is undertaken every three years.\nThe purpose of the survey is to obtain global, comprehensive, and consistent information on the size and structure of the foreign exchange and OTC derivatives markets. The data are collected to increase market transparency and to help central banks, market participants, and others better understand and monitor patterns of activity in global financial markets.\nThe Bank of Canada is releasing the summary results of its survey today, as are many other participating central banks. As well, the BIS is issuing a press release that summarizes highlights of the aggregated global turnover.1 Canada has participated in this survey since 1983, and summary results of earlier surveys are shown in Tables 1 through 4 and 7.\nAlmost all dealers in Canada that are active in the wholesale foreign exchange and derivatives markets were surveyed. These 14 financial institutions are estimated to be involved in approximately 98 per cent of the transactions executed in Canada.2 With respect to foreign exchange, the survey covered spot transactions, outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps, currency swaps,3 and OTC options. The interest rate products covered were forward-rate agreements, interest rate swaps, and OTC options. Participants were also asked to identify transactions by currency and type of counterparty, and, in the case of foreign exchange, they were asked to identify the execution method for each transaction.\nThe turnover part of the triennial survey is conducted on the basis of residence or location. In particular, the basis for reporting is the country in which the sales desk of a trade is located.4 Where no sales desk is involved in a deal, the trading desk is used to determine the location. Although there was some variation in their individual qualitative assessments, on average, reporting dealers in Canada indicated that turnover activity during the month of April was normal and that activity was steady to increasing compared to the previous six months.\nAdditional tables on the results of the Canadian survey, including detailed tables on amounts outstanding, will be made available on the FX Volumes and Rates of the Canadian Foreign Exchange Committee\u2019s (CFEC\u2019s) website (<www.cfec.ca>) later this year. These will be published after the release of the final comprehensive global report of the BIS on the 2016 survey. CFEC\u2019s website will contain a direct link to that report once it is available."

While household vulnerabilities have moved higher, the ongoing economic recovery in Canada means that the overall risk remains the same. The Canadian financial system is resilient and functioning effectively.\nThe Bank continues to highlight two vulnerabilities related to Canadian households: the elevated level of household indebtedness and imbalances in some regional housing markets. A third vulnerability identified is the fragility of fixed-income market liquidity.\nStrong regional divergences persist among housing markets. Job losses have increased financial stress for some highly indebted households in the regions most affected by low commodity prices. Meanwhile, in the greater Vancouver and Toronto areas, rapidly rising house prices and strong mortgage credit growth are increasing the share of highly indebted households. In these two markets, it is unlikely that economic fundamentals will justify continued strong price increases.\n\u201cThis suggests that prospective homebuyers and their lenders should not extrapolate recent real estate performance into the future when contemplating a transaction,\u201d said Governor Stephen S. Poloz.\nThe vulnerabilities described in the FSR could propagate shocks throughout the financial system if a major event were to trigger one of the identified risks. The most important continues to be a severe recession and an ensuing sharp increase in unemployment that impairs debt service and leads to a broad-based correction in house prices. The probability remains low as the economy continues to grow, supported by continued expansion in the United States, and accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus in Canada.\nOther key risks identified are a sharp increase in interest rates due to higher global risk premiums, stress emanating from China and other emerging-market economies, and a prolonged weakness in commodity prices.\nPublished twice a year, the FSR is intended to raise early awareness of the key vulnerabilities and risks to the Canadian financial system. It focuses on downside risks, rather than the most likely future path for the financial system.\nThe June issue of the FSR also features two reports written by Bank of Canada staff:"

    "Monetary/fiscal policy mix has implications for debt and financial stability, Governor Poloz says": {

        "text": "The mix of monetary and fiscal policies in an economy has important implications for debt levels and financial stability over the medium term, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen S. Poloz said today.\nIn the Doug Purvis Memorial Lecture given at the Canadian Economics Association\u2019s annual conference, Governor Poloz used the Bank\u2019s main policy model to construct three \u201ccounterfactual\u201d scenarios of events from the past 30 years that show how different policy mixes can influence the amount of debt taken on by the private and public sectors.\nTight monetary policy with easy fiscal policy may lead to the same growth and inflation results as easy monetary policy paired with tight fiscal policy in a given situation, the Governor explained. However, the consequences for government and private sector debt levels would be quite different.\nRecent experience in Canada and elsewhere shows that debt levels\u2014whether public or private\u2014can provoke financial stability concerns, said Governor Poloz. The insight about policy mix is important as authorities worldwide work to incorporate financial stability issues into the conduct of monetary policy, he added.\nThe Governor stressed that the counterfactuals are intended to illustrate the impact of the policy mix on debt levels; they aren\u2019t meant to be taken as an opinion about what the best policy mix was in the past or is now.\n\u201cHindsight is always 20:20 and such a discussion would have little meaning,\u201d Governor Poloz said. \u201cThe best mix of monetary and fiscal policy will depend on the economic situation.\u201d\nThere should be a degree of coordination between the monetary and fiscal authorities that allows both to be adequately informed of each other\u2019s policies and consider their implications on debt levels over the medium term, the Governor said. In Canada\u2019s case, the central bank operates under an explicit inflation-targeting agreement with the federal government that enshrines its operational independence, while allowing for both parties to share information and judgment, Poloz said. This framework represents \u201ca simple yet elegant form\u201d of policy coordination, he noted.\nThe lecture honours Doug Purvis, a Canadian macroeconomist and Queen\u2019s University professor. In 1985, Purvis delivered the Harold Innis Lecture, in which he argued that rising government debt levels would eventually compromise the ability of authorities to implement stabilization policies. Governor Poloz said his lecture today is meant to build on Purvis\u2019 initial insights by bringing more advanced macroeconomic models to bear on the topic, and linking them to the topical issue of financial stability."

        "text": "The Governor of the Bank of Canada has designated, effective 2 May 2016, the Automated Clearing Settlement System (ACSS) for oversight under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act (PCSA) as a clearing and settlement system that has the potential to pose payments system risk. The ACSS is owned and operated by the Canadian Payments Association (CPA), an organization established by the Canadian Payments Act to operate national payment systems.\nThe ACSS is being designated following the expansion of the Bank\u2019s oversight responsibilities in December 2014 to include systems that have the potential to pose payments system risk (referred to as Prominent Payment Systems). A disruption or failure of a Prominent Payment System could cause a significant adverse effect on economic activity in Canada, potentially leading to a general loss of confidence in the overall Canadian payments system.\nEach day the ACSS clears the majority of non-cash retail payments in Canada, or almost 27 million transactions with a value of $24.7 billion, on average. Given the variety of payments cleared, several without immediate substitutes, and the importance of those payments for a broad range of economic activity, it is considered to be central to the Canadian payments system.1\nDesignation brings the system under the formal oversight of the Bank of Canada, which requires compliance with Risk Management Standards for Prominent Payment Systems. These are based on the CPMI-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI); amended to reflect the different risks posed by Prominent Payment Systems compared to systems designated as systemically important. Designation also provides the system with legal protections that are important to the finality of payments.\nThe Minister of Finance has confirmed that he is of the opinion that designation of the ACSS is in the public interest.\nUnder the PCSA, the Bank of Canada has formal responsibility for the designation and oversight of clearing and settlement systems that have the potential to pose systemic, or payments system risk.\nSince the PCSA was adopted in 1996, five financial market infrastructures have been previously designated by the Bank as having the potential to pose systemic risk: the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS), which clears and settles large-value Canadian-dollar payments; CDSX, which clears and settles securities transactions; CLS Bank, a global system for the settlement of foreign exchange transactions; SwapClear, the dominant global system for centrally clearing over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps (IRS); and the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Service, which centrally clears fixed-income and derivatives contracts.\nIn 2014, the federal government amended the act to give the Bank of Canada the additional responsibility to oversee payment systems that, while not systemically important, have the potential to pose payments system risk. The ACSS is the only system to have received this designation by the Bank.\nFor further information on the Bank of Canada\u2019s responsibilities for the oversight of clearing and settlement systems in Canada, please visit the Bank\u2019s website."

Poloz said in a speech today at the Mayor\u2019s Breakfast Series in Ottawa.\nLast month\u2019s interest rate increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve is the first step in a long process toward normalizing monetary policy in the United States, the Governor said. While this will have implications for Canada and its financial markets, the Bank of Canada is well equipped to respond. \u201cWe have a number of tools at our disposal\u2014both conventional and unconventional\u2014to mitigate risks to our inflation target or to our financial system, should they arise,\u201d he said.\nThe drop in resource prices has meant large declines in the terms of trade for resource-producing countries such as Canada, Governor Poloz explained. This shock is reversing trends established in Canada over the past decade, and policy-makers should facilitate the necessary economic adjustments. \u201cThe forces that have been set in motion simply must work themselves out,\u201d the Governor said.\n\u201cThis is exactly why countries choose to have flexible exchange rates,\u201d Governor Poloz explained. The currency depreciation is operating through three channels. First, it is offsetting part of the drop in commodity prices. Second, it is helping promote growth in non-resource sectors through stronger exports. Third, and less desirably, it is spreading\u00a0the impact of the loss of income across the entire economy, he said.\nStill, \u201ca flexible exchange rate is not a policy panacea,\u201d Governor Poloz said. Other policies can also serve as buffers \u201cwhile still encouraging the necessary longer-term adjustments, including fiscal policies and policies that make labour markets more flexible,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in this situation before,\u201d the Governor concluded. \u201cThe Bank of Canada will continue to run an independent monetary policy, anchored by our inflation target, and we will use our tools to manage risks along the way.\u201d"

        "text": "Vulnerabilities in the housing sector have edged higher, the Bank of Canada said today in its Financial System Review (FSR), while the overall level of risk to Canada\u2019s financial system has remained roughly unchanged since June.\nThe Bank continues to identify two key vulnerabilities related to the Canadian household sector: the elevated level of household indebtedness, and imbalances in the housing market. A third vulnerability relates to uncertain market liquidity in fixed-income markets.\nNonetheless, the Bank believes that the Canadian financial system is resilient and that the global financial system has been made safer through the implementation of recent reforms, most notably larger capital and liquidity buffers at major financial institutions.\nThe Bank\u2019s base-case scenario continues to predict a constructive evolution of housing imbalances, said Governor Stephen S. Poloz. \u201cHousing activity should stabilize in line with economic growth, as the driver of growth in the economy switches from household spending to non-resource exports. Certain vulnerabilities are still edging higher, but recent changes by Canadian authorities to the rules for mortgage financing will help to mitigate these risks as we move into 2016.\u201d\nHousehold vulnerabilities could be exacerbated by a severe recession that is accompanied by a widespread and prolonged rise in unemployment. This could reduce the ability of households to service their debt and cause serious and broad-based declines in house prices.This is the most important risk outlined in the FSR, but its probability of occurring remains low. The drop in commodity prices in 2015 has reduced Canadian incomes and wealth, but to date there is no evidence of a significant increase in loan delinquency rates.\nThe other key risks identified in the FSR are a sudden increase in global risk premiums which would lead to higher borrowing rates; stress emanating from China and other emerging-market economies; and prolonged weakness in commodity prices.\nThe FSR, published twice a year, is intended to raise early awareness of vulnerabilities and potential triggers that could turn them into a risk to the Canadian financial system. It focuses on downside risks and is not a prediction of the most likely outcomes.\nThe December FSR includes two reports that further refine the Bank\u2019s analysis of the housing sector:"

As of this day, Elizabeth II\u2019s reign exceeds that of her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, making Her Majesty the longest-reigning sovereign in Canada\u2019s modern era.\nThe commemorative bank note is a variation of the existing $20 polymer bank note that already features a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. The new note is identical to the current $20 note, with one distinct difference: its large window contains a range of special design elements, including a portrait of Her Majesty wearing a crown (tiara) for the first time on a Canadian bank note. The portrait is based on a 1951 image by renowned Canadian photographer Yousuf Karsh \u2013 the same photograph that inspired the portrait engraving of the Queen, without the crown, for the 1954 Canadian Landscape series of bank notes and the 1967 commemorative note celebrating Confederation. Since her accession to the throne in 1952, an image of Her Majesty has appeared on every series of Canadian bank notes.\nThe Bank of Canada\u2019s Chief of Currency, Richard Wall, unveiled the commemorative note, together with the Governor General of Canada, His Excellency the Right Honourable David Johnston.\n\u201cThis is a unique milestone in the history of the monarchy in our country, and the Bank of Canada is honoured to mark the occasion in this special way. Over Her Majesty\u2019s reign, the technology behind our bank notes has continually evolved \u2013 to the state-of-the-art polymer notes we have today. It is therefore fitting that we are commemorating this historic occasion by using one of the most advanced security features of our current notes \u2013 the large holographic window,\u201d said Mr. Wall.\nThe Bank of Canada will issue 40 million commemorative notes, the first of which will start to be available at financial institutions across Canada tomorrow. They will circulate alongside the existing $20 note, which will continue to be issued and will comprise the vast majority of $20 notes in circulation.\nNotes to Editors:"

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent.\nTotal CPI inflation in Canada has been around 1 per cent in recent months, reflecting year-over-year price declines for consumer energy products. Core inflation has been close to 2 per cent, with disinflationary pressures from economic slack being offset by transitory effects of the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar and some sector-specific factors. Setting aside these transitory effects, the Bank judges that the underlying trend in inflation is about 1.5 to 1.7 per cent.\nGlobal growth faltered in early 2015, principally in the United States and China. \u00a0Recent indicators suggest a rebound in the U.S. economy in the second half of this year, and growth is expected to be solid through the projection. In contrast, China is slowing amid an ongoing process of rebalancing to a more sustainable growth path. This has pulled down prices of certain commodities that are important to Canada\u2019s exports. Financial conditions in major economies remain very accommodative and continue to provide much-needed support to economic activity. Global growth is expected to strengthen over the second half of 2015, averaging about 3\u00a0per cent for the year, and accelerate to around 3 1/2 per cent in 2016 and 2017.\nThe Bank\u2019s estimate of growth in Canada in 2015 has been marked down considerably from its April projection. The downward revision reflects further downgrades of business investment plans in the energy sector, as well as weaker-than-expected exports of non-energy commodities and non-commodities.\u00a0 Real GDP is now projected to have contracted modestly in the first half of the year, resulting in higher excess capacity and additional downward pressure on inflation.\nThe Bank expects growth to resume in the third quarter and begin to exceed potential again in the fourth quarter, led by the non-resource sectors of Canada\u2019s economy. Outside the energy-producing regions, consumer confidence remains high and labour markets continue to improve. This will support consumption, which will also receive a fiscal boost. Recent evidence suggests a pickup in activity and rising capacity pressures among manufacturers, particularly those exporters that are most sensitive to movements in the Canadian dollar. Financial conditions for households and businesses remain very stimulative.\nThe Bank now projects Canada\u2019s real GDP will grow by just over 1 per cent in 2015 and about 2 1/2 per cent in 2016 and 2017. With this revised growth profile, the output gap is significantly larger than was expected in April, and closes somewhat later. The Bank anticipates that the economy will return to full capacity and inflation to 2 per cent on a sustained basis in the first half of 2017.\nThe lower outlook for Canadian growth has increased the downside risks to inflation. While vulnerabilities associated with household imbalances remain elevated and could edge higher, Canada\u2019s economy is undergoing a significant and complex adjustment. Additional monetary stimulus is required at this time to help return the economy to full capacity and inflation sustainably to target.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 9 September 2015. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the Monetary Policy Report on 21 October 2015."

        "text": "The overall risk to financial stability in Canada has risen in the face of lower oil prices, but the resilience of the system continues to improve, the Bank of Canada said today as it released its biannualFinancial System Review (FSR).\nThe FSR is intended to raise awareness of the key vulnerabilities, possible triggers and risks to the financial system. The Bank\u2019s assessment is that there is a low probability that the risks identified in the FSR will materialize. Policies and regulations are in place to promote the strength and soundness of the Canadian financial system.\nElevated household indebtedness remains an important vulnerability in the financial system, as it was at the time of the December FSR. Imbalances in the housing market, which are closely related to the state of household finances, are another key concern highlighted in the report.\n\u201cWe judge that the vulnerability associated with household indebtedness is edging higher, and the overall risk to financial stability in Canada is slightly higher than it was at the time of our December FSR,\u201d said Governor Stephen S. Poloz.\nThe vulnerabilities described in the FSR could amplify and propagate shocks throughout the system if an event were to trigger any of the four major risks to financial stability. The most important domestic risk is a broad-based decline in employment and incomes that would significantly reduce the ability of households to service their debt, leading to a widespread correction in house prices.\nThe oil price shock has increased the risk to financial stability, the FSR states, by delaying improvements to incomes and economic growth and impacting the housing markets of oil-producing regions. However, the decline in oil prices alone is unlikely to trigger a material risk to the system as a whole. The Bank continues to expect the imbalances in the household sector and housing market to ease as the economy improves.\nThe other key risks identified in the FSR are sharply higher long-term interest rates, globally and in Canada; stress emanating from China and other emerging-market economies; and financial stress from the euro area.\nGovernor Poloz said significant reforms under way in the global and domestic financial systems are designed to reduce the likelihood and impact of future turmoil. \u201cThere is no question the global financial system is now more resilient, thanks to these reforms,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, while risks may have edged higher, safeguards to protect the financial system are stronger than they were before.\u201d\nThe June 2015 FSR includes two reports summarizing recent work by Bank of Canada staff on specific financial sector policies:"

The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/2 per cent.\nTotal CPI inflation in Canada has fallen as expected, reflecting the significant drop in oil prices. Core inflation remains close to 2 per cent and continues to be temporarily boosted by the pass-through effects of the lower Canadian dollar, as well as sector-specific factors.\nThe global economy is evolving broadly in line with projections in the Bank\u2019s January Monetary Policy Report (MPR). The United States remains the main source of momentum in the global economy, while headwinds to growth linger in many regions. In this context, a growing number of central banks have taken actions to ease monetary conditions. Crude oil prices are close to the Bank\u2019s MPR assumptions.\nCanadian economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 was consistent with the Bank\u2019s expectations. The oil price shock had a modest early impact on aggregate demand, and a larger effect on income. The Bank continues to expect that most of the negative impact from lower oil prices will appear in the first half of 2015, although it may be even more front-loaded than projected in January. Nevertheless, data for 2014 as a whole suggest the anticipated rotation into stronger growth in non-energy exports and investment is well underway.\nFinancial conditions in Canada have eased materially since January, in response to the Bank\u2019s recent monetary policy action and to global financial developments. This easing is reflected across the yield curve and in a wide range of asset prices, including the Canadian dollar. These conditions will mitigate the negative effects of the oil price shock, further boosting growth through stronger non-energy exports and investment.\nIn light of these developments, the risks around the inflation profile are now more balanced and financial stability risks are evolving as expected in January. At present, we judge that the current degree of monetary policy stimulus is still appropriate and the target for the overnight rate remains at 3/4 per cent.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 15 April 2015. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."

        "text": "The Canadian economy still has room to grow, and the sharp drop in oil prices is a setback, Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said in Ottawa today, adding that monetary policy will support the needed adjustments.\nAs the Bank assesses the underlying inflation pressures in the Canadian economy, it is critical that it consider a broad range of indicators, including those that go beyond the headline unemployment rate, Ms. Wilkins said. Given the destructive recession Canada experienced, measures of economic slack that focus on the labour market show greater unused capacity than broader measures do.\n\u201cUnderstanding the degree of slack in the economy helps us avoid making policy  decisions that could trigger inflationary or disinflationary pressures,\u201d Ms. Wilkins told members of the Ottawa Economics Association. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to inadvertently stifle the rebuilding phase of an economy that will need to adjust to a lower price of oil.\u201d\nAs a net exporter of energy, Canada is now feeling the negative effects of the oil-price shock, which increased the downside risks to inflation. There will be some offsets from a stronger U.S. economy and a weaker Canadian dollar, although these are uncertain and will take longer to materialize.\nIf low oil prices persist, they will spur a significant reallocation of workers across sectors and regions, as the energy sector cools and non-energy exports take on the mantle of growth.\nThe labour market and the output gaps will close over time as the economy grows, firm creation and business investment pick up, and as capacity is rebuilt. It is possible that the two gaps will not close simultaneously, as would likely be the case in a more typical business cycle. \u201cAn economy pushing up against the limits of its capacity may be just what is required to signal the need for additional investments and to draw workers back into the labour force,\u201d Ms. Wilkins said.\nBy providing an environment of low and stable inflation, monetary policy is supporting the adjustments needed to return the economy to sustained and balanced growth, Ms. Wilkins concluded. \u201cWe\u2019ll get there and it will be a very good thing for Canada.\u201d"

The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/2 per cent. This decision is in response to the recent sharp drop in oil prices, which will be negative for growth and underlying inflation in Canada.\nInflation has remained close to the 2 per cent target in recent quarters. Core inflation has been temporarily boosted by sector-specific factors and the pass-through effects of the lower Canadian dollar, which are offsetting disinflationary pressures from slack in the economy and competition in the retail sector. Total CPI inflation is starting to reflect the fall in oil prices.\nOil\u2019s sharp decline in the past six months is expected to boost global economic growth, especially in the United States, while widening the divergences among economies. Persistent headwinds from deleveraging and lingering uncertainty will influence the extent to which some oil-importing countries benefit from lower prices. The Bank\u2019s base-case projection assumes oil prices around US$60 per barrel. Prices are currently lower but our belief is that prices over the medium term are likely to be higher.\nThe oil price shock is occurring against a backdrop of solid and more broadly-based growth in Canada in recent quarters. Outside the energy sector, we are beginning to see the anticipated sequence of increased foreign demand, stronger exports, improved business confidence and investment, and employment growth. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the speed with which this sequence will evolve and how it will be affected by the drop in oil prices. Business investment in the energy-producing sector will decline. Canada\u2019s weaker terms of trade will have an adverse impact on incomes and wealth, reducing domestic demand growth.\nAlthough there is considerable uncertainty around the outlook, the Bank is projecting real GDP growth will slow to about 1 1/2 per cent and the output gap to widen in the first half of 2015. The negative impact of lower oil prices will gradually be mitigated by a stronger U.S. economy, a weaker Canadian dollar, and the Bank\u2019s monetary policy response. The Bank expects Canada\u2019s economy to gradually strengthen in the second half of this year, with real GDP growth averaging 2.1 per cent in 2015 and 2.4 per cent in 2016. The economy is expected to return to full capacity around the end of 2016, a little later than was expected in October.\nWeaker oil prices will pull down the inflation profile. Total CPI inflation is projected to be temporarily below the inflation-control range during 2015, moving back up to target the following year. Underlying inflation will ease in the near term but then return gradually to 2 per cent over the projection horizon.\nThe oil price shock increases both downside risks to the inflation profile and financial stability risks. The Bank\u2019s policy action is intended to provide insurance against these risks, support the sectoral adjustment needed to strengthen investment and growth, and bring the Canadian economy back to full capacity and inflation to target within the projection horizon.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 4 March 2015. The next full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the Monetary Policy Report on 15 April 2015."

        "text": "Risks to Canada\u2019s financial system have not increased in the past six months, but high consumer debt loads and imbalances in the housing market remain a concern, the Bank of Canada said today in itsbiannual Financial System Review (FSR).\n\u201cWe judge that the probability of an adverse shock has eased since our June FSR,\u201d said Governor Stephen S. Poloz. \u201cThis mitigates our observation that some financial vulnerabilities appear to be edging higher, leaving our overall assessment of financial stability risk roughly the same as in June.\u201d\nWhile the FSR highlights risks, it is important to remember that global regulatory reform continues to enhance financial resilience in Canada and around the world. Further progress has been made in the past year.\nThe FSR discusses three important vulnerabilities in the financial system:\nThe FSR framework also identifies important risks to financial stability that could expose these vulnerabilities should the risks materialize. The most important risk is the inability of stretched households to service their debt should they face a sharp decline in their incomes or a sharp rise in interest rates, which could trigger a correction in house prices. The probability of this happening is low, but if it did, the effect on the economy would be severe. The Bank maintains its assessment of this risk as elevated, but continues to expect a soft landing in the housing market as the global economy gathers strength and interest rates normalize.\nAnother risk identified in the FSR is that a sudden shift in market expectations about U.S. monetary policy leads to a spike in global term premiums and long-term interest rates that would be transmitted to Canada through financial markets. In addition, a significant stress event in the euro area could trigger a financial crisis that feeds back to the real economy. Finally, there could be a serious financial disruption in China that causes Chinese and global economic growth to slow significantly. These four key risks to the Canadian financial system are the same as those outlined in June, as is the level of severity assigned to them.\n\u201cWe are also monitoring other emerging vulnerabilities and risks to the global economic outlook, including the continued weakness in oil and other commodity prices that could cause financial stress in some economies,\u201d Governor Poloz said.\nThe Bank of Canada actively fosters a stable and efficient financial system as part of its commitment to promote the economic and financial welfare of Canada. Economic stability and financial stability are interrelated, and the Bank considers the risks to both in an integrated fashion.\nThe Bank\u2019s risk-assessment framework is not intended to predict the most likely outcomes for the financial system, but to help Canadians better understand the forces at work in the economy. The framework focuses explicitly on the vulnerabilities in the Canadian financial system and how they are evolving. The vulnerabilities, and their interactions, determine the severity of the impact in the event that a particular risk is triggered. The main financial stability risks are then assessed according to their probability and potential impact.\nThe December 2014 FSR also contains two reports summarizing recent work by Bank of Canada staff on specific financial sector policies:"

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today unveiled an enhanced framework to gauge the evolving risks to financial stability in its semi-annual Financial System Review (FSR), finding that the Canadian financial system is robust but still faces significant vulnerabilities.\n\u201cAfter weighing the risks to financial stability through our improved framework, our level of comfort as policy makers remains roughly what it was six months ago,\u201d said Governor Stephen S. Poloz. \u201cOur analysis shows that household imbalances remain the most important vulnerability and could amplify the impact of external shocks.\u201d\nThe new FSR framework identifies important vulnerabilities to the financial system. While the Bank continues to see a constructive evolution in housing market imbalances and household credit, valuations are stretched, there is overbuilding in some parts of the housing market, and household indebtedness remains high. The financial system is also exposed to potential external shocks through the country\u2019s economic and financial links with the rest of the world.\nIn light of these vulnerabilities, the Bank judges that the level of risk associated with a sharp correction in house prices remains elevated. The probability of this risk is low given signs that the housing market is still headed for a soft landing, but the impact on the economy and financial system would be severe should it materialize.\nThe Bank sees that the risk of financial stress emanating from China and other emerging-market economies has increased since December, while the risk of a renewed euro-area crisis has diminished. A sharp increase in global long term interest rates is the fourth risk highlighted by the Bank.\nThe Bank of Canada actively fosters a stable and efficient financial system as part of its commitment to promote the economic and financial welfare of Canada. Economic stability and financial stability are interrelated, and the Bank considers the risks to both in an integrated fashion.\nThe new risk assessment framework is intended to help Canadians better understand the forces at work in the economy.

        "text": "The Bank of Canada has announced the entry into circulation of the new $5 and $10 polymer bank notes. Starting today, these final two notes in the new polymer Frontiers series will be available at financial institutions across Canada.\nBank of Canada Governor Stephen S. Poloz launched the $5 note at the Canadian Space Agency in Saint-Hubert, Quebec. He was joined by Chris Hadfield, retired Canadian astronaut and former Commander of the International Space Station. The $10 note was launched at an event held simultaneously at Vancouver\u2019s train station by Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem and VIA Rail Canada President and Chief Executive Officer Marc Lalibert\u00e9.\n\u201cWith the introduction of the $5 and $10, we complete the rollout of a series that is at the frontier of bank note technology and sets a global benchmark for bank note security,\u201d said Governor Poloz. \u201cThese leading-edge notes are not only hard to counterfeit, but they are also designed to be easy to check. All five denominations in the Frontiers series carry the same security features that help Canadians verify them with ease and ensure that counterfeiting levels in Canada remain very low.\u201d\nFor the first time since the 1954 series, the Bank of Canada is issuing two notes on the same day. This helps manufacturers, owners and operators of bank note equipment upgrade their machines at a lower cost. The Bank of Canada has been working closely with Canada\u2019s financial sector and the cash-handling industry since 2009 and throughout the launch of this series to support a successful transition to polymer notes.\n\u201cNot only are these notes safer, they are also cheaper and greener than the previous series,\u201d said Senior Deputy Governor Macklem. \u201cThey last longer than paper notes, which will save millions of dollars, since fewer polymer notes will have to be printed. Fewer notes produced means fewer notes transported and this means a reduced impact on the Canadian environment. Plus, polymer notes will be recycled.\u201d\nChris Hadfield spoke of the significance of featuring Canadian robotics innovations on the new $5 note. \u201cThe Canadarm2 and Dextre images on the $5 bank note remind me of the determination, ingenuity and dedication of so many people at the Canadian Space Agency, in the space industry and academia across the country. As Canadians use the new $5 note and see these space symbols, I know they will be reminded of these qualities,\u201d he said.\nMarc Lalibert\u00e9 added that VIA Rail is proud that the new $10 note features the Canadian train. \u201cToday is the 128th anniversary of the driving of the last spike that completed the construction of Canada\u2019s railway, and linked the country from sea to sea. So it is only fitting that this new $10 bank note should celebrate the pioneering spirit, and the true grit and determination of Canadians who helped unite our country, with the promise of an even better future.\u201d\nThe themes of the denominations are:\n$100 Medical Innovation - celebrates Canadian innovations in the field of medicine (Portrait: Sir Robert Borden)\n$50 CCGS Amundsen, Research Icebreaker - reflects Canada\u2019s commitment to Arctic research and the development and support of northern communities (Portrait: William Lyon Mackenzie King)\n$20 The Canadian National Vimy Memorial - evokes the contributions and sacrifices of Canadians in conflicts throughout our history (Portrait: HM Queen Elizabeth II)\n$10 The Canadian train - represents Canada\u2019s great engineering feat of linking its eastern and western frontiers by what was, at the time, the longest railway ever built (Portrait: Sir\u00a0John A. Macdonald)\n$5 Canadarm2 and Dextre - symbolizes Canada\u2019s continuing contribution to the international space station program through robotics innovation (Portrait: Sir Wilfrid Laurier)\nMore information on the new Frontiers series can be obtained by contacting \n    \n, 613\u00a0782-8782."

        "text": "During the month of April, the Bank of Canada and 52 other central banks and monetary authorities conducted a survey of turnover activity in the foreign exchange and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets in their respective countries. This worldwide effort was coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and is undertaken every three years.\nThe purpose of the survey is to obtain global, comprehensive, and consistent information on the size and structure of the foreign exchange and OTC derivatives markets. The data are collected to increase market transparency and to help central banks, market participants, and others better understand and monitor patterns of activity in global financial markets.\nThe Bank of Canada is releasing the summary results of its survey today, as are many other participating central banks. As well, the BIS is issuing a press release that summarizes highlights of the aggregated global turnover. 1 Canada has participated in this survey since 1983, and summary results of earlier surveys are shown in Tables 1 through 4 and 7.\nAlmost all financial institutions in Canada that are active in the wholesale foreign exchange and derivatives markets were surveyed. They consisted of 15 financial institutions, estimated to represent approximately 98 per cent of these markets in Canada. 2 With respect to foreign exchange, the survey covered spot transactions, outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps, currency swaps, 3 and OTC options. The interest rate products covered were forward-rate agreements, interest rate swaps, and OTC options. Participants were also asked to identify transactions by currency and type of counterparty, and, in the case of foreign exchange, they were asked to identify the execution method for each transaction.\nThe turnover part of the triennial survey is conducted on the basis of residence or location. In particular, the basis for reporting is the country in which the sales desk of a trade is located. 4 Where no sales desk is involved in a deal, the trading desk is used to determine the location. Although there was variation in their individual qualitative assessments, on average, reporting dealers in Canada indicated that turnover activity during the month of April was normal and that activity was increasing compared to the previous six months.\nNote:\u00a0 Additional tables on the results of the Canadian survey, including detailed tables on amounts outstanding, will be made available on the FX Volumes and Rates of the Canadian Foreign Exchange Committee\u2019s (CFEC\u2019s) website later this year.\u00a0 These will be published after the release of the final comprehensive BIS 2013 Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity report expected before the end of the year. The CFEC\u2019s website will contain a direct link to that report once it is available."

Both of the new notes will begin circulating, at the same time, this November.\nMinister of Finance Jim Flaherty, Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney and Paul G. Smith, Chairman of the Board at VIA Rail Canada, were joined via satellite by Canadian Space Agency Astronaut Chris Hadfield, Commander of the International Space Station, to unveil these final two notes in the new Polymer series.\n\u201cCanadians can be very proud of their new polymer bank notes,\u201d said Minister Flaherty. \u201cWith today\u2019s unveiling of the final two notes in the series, one can see not only the unique story that each of the five denominations tells, but the unifying theme that underlies them all - the profound courage, determination, and ingenuity of our nation and its people.\u201d\nThe new $5 and $10 notes will carry the same leading-edge security features as the $20, $50 and $100 polymer notes already in circulation. Featuring a sophisticated combination of transparency and holography, this is the most secure bank note series ever issued by the Bank of Canada. The Polymer series is more economical, lasting at least two and half times longer than cotton-based paper bank notes, and will be recycled in Canada.\n\u201cThe Polymer series notes are at the frontier of bank note technology. The new $5 and $10 bank notes depict the frontiers of our country and our planet,\u201d Governor Carney said. \u201cIt is fitting that we are today crossing the final frontier for a world first - the unveiling of a bank note from space.\u201d\nWhile orbiting more than 350 kilometres above Earth, Commander Hadfield gave Canadians their first look at the new $5 polymer note. It features images of Canadarm2 and Dextre - robotics innovations used to build and maintain the Space Station and that symbolize Canada\u2019s ongoing contribution to the international space program.\n\u201cI try to inspire young Canadians to aim high. This new $5 bill should do the same,\u201d Commander Hadfield said. \u201cBy giving prominence to Canadian achievements in space, this bank note reminds us that not even the sky is the limit.\u201d\nThe front of the $5 note features a portrait of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Prime Minister of Canada from 1896 to 1911.\nVIA Rail Canada\u2019s Paul G. Smith unveiled the new $10 polymer note at the Bank of Canada. The new $10 note features a striking image of The Canadian train journeying through the Rocky Mountains, and represents the enormous feat of engineering that linked Canada\u2019s East and West by rail. A portrait of Sir John A. Macdonald, who was Prime Minister of Canada (1867-1873, 1878-1891) at the time of the railway completion, is featured on the front of the note.\n\u201cThe transcontinental railway helped build modern Canada. On behalf of VIA Rail, I am delighted that this accomplishment, through the use of this iconic image, has been honoured on the new $10 bank note,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cNot only did the railway contribute to Canada\u2019s economic prosperity by moving people and goods across this vast land, but it also gave Canadians the means to seek new frontiers of their own.\"\nOver the months leading up to the issuance of these notes in November 2013, the Bank will continue to work closely with financial institutions, manufacturers of bank-note-handling equipment and retailers to ensure a smooth transition.

It is operated by LCH.Clearnet Limited (LCH), a U.K.-based company that operates a number of central counterparty (CCP) services.\nClearing activity of Canadian institutions in SwapClear has increased substantially, in line with Canada\u2019s G-20 commitment to centrally clear all standardized OTC derivatives. There is potential for further growth, given the decision by Canadian authorities in October 2012 that any CCP that clears OTC derivatives and is recognized by Canadian authorities, including global CCPs, can be used by Canadian market participants, provided that the CCP complies with the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (the Principles) published by CPSS-IOSCO 1 and that the four safeguards identified by the Financial Stability Board are met. 2\nThe Bank of Canada has determined that SwapClear, an eligible system under the PCSA, 3 has the potential to pose systemic risk to the Canadian financial system because of:\nThe Minister of Finance has confirmed that he is of the opinion that designation is in the public interest.\n\u201cThe designation of SwapClear represents a significant milestone towards achieving a safer and more resilient financial system for Canadian participants,\u201d said Governor Mark Carney. \u201cOur involvement in the oversight of SwapClear, to ensure strong risk management prevails, will enable Canada to reap the benefits of the central clearing of OTC interest rate derivatives, as envisioned by the G20.\u201d\nDesignation brings the system under the formal oversight of the Bank of Canada, which requires all designated systems to comply with the Principles, and provides the Bank with powers to support the system\u2019s ongoing progress toward meeting the four safeguards. Designation also provides the system\u2019s clearing and settlement rules with legal protections under Canadian law, including with respect to netting, finality of payment and finality of settlement. Upon the effective date of designation, the Bank of Canada will fulfill its oversight responsibilities through participation in a multilateral arrangement for oversight co-operation led by SwapClear\u2019s lead regulator, the Bank of England, and through bilateral interaction with the Bank of England and LCH.\nUnder the PCSA, the Bank of Canada has formal responsibility for the oversight of designated clearing and settlement systems, 4 for the purpose of controlling systemic risk. In this context, systemic risk is defined as the risk that the default of one participant in a clearing and settlement system, or a serious problem arising within the system itself, could lead, through the activities of the system, to the default of other institutions or systems.\nFour systems have been previously designated by the Bank: the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS), which clears and settles large-value Canadian-dollar payments; CDSX, which clears and settles securities transactions; CLS Bank, a global system for the settlement of foreign exchange transactions; and the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Service, which centrally clears fixed-income and derivatives contracts.\nFor further information on the Bank of Canada\u2019s responsibilities for the oversight of clearing and settlement systems in Canada, please visit the Bank's website."

Starting today, these new notes will gradually become available at financial institutions across Canada.\nBank of Canada Governor Mark Carney was joined at the event by Minister of Finance Jim Flaherty, Minister of Veterans Affairs Steven Blaney, and David Houghton, President of the Vimy Foundation.\n\u201cThe introduction of the $20 note is an important milestone for the new Polymer series. Making up half of all bank notes in circulation, the $20 note is the most used denomination,\u201d said Governor Carney. \u201cOur safer, cheaper, greener polymer notes will soon be part of Canadians\u2019 daily lives.

This iconic monument, located in Vimy, France, commemorates the 1917 Victory at Vimy Ridge and honours Canadians who fought and gave their lives in the First World War in France and who have no known grave.\n\u201cIt is fitting that we are launching these new notes at the Canadian War Museum only a few days before Remembrance Day. These new notes pay tribute to the sacrifices of Canadian men and women who fought to protect Canada and its allies in all military conflicts,\u201d said Minister Flaherty. \u201cThey also protect Canadians from the threat of counterfeiting. The Polymer series is a Canadian innovation of which we can all be proud.\u201d\nMinister Blaney spoke of the special significance to Veterans of featuring the Canadian National Vimy Memorial on the $20 note. \u201cWith these notes, Canadians are honouring the contributions and sacrifices of our military men and women, a powerful sentiment that will resonate strongly with our Veterans and their families.\u201d\nVimy Foundation President David Houghton added, \u201cEach time we open our wallets, we will be reminded of the significance of the Battle of Vimy Ridge in Canadian history - a pivotal moment when our country came of age.\u201d\nThe\u00a0remaining bank notes in the series - the $5 and $10 notes - will be issued by the end of 2013.

He joined the Bank in 1938 and served as its Governor from 1955 until 1961.\nDuring the trying economic and political period in which he governed the Bank, three important and lasting legacies were established - legacies that directly influence the Bank\u2019s monetary policy framework today.\nMr. Coyne firmly believed, when many others did not, that low and stable inflation should be the paramount objective of monetary policy - a principle that has since become the cornerstone of monetary policy frameworks around the world. In addition, he was a strong proponent of a flexible exchange rate regime. As a result, Canada has had one of the longest experiences with a floating currency in the entire world.\u00a0 Finally, his central role in the controversy between the Bank and the Government of Canada during the \u201cCoyne Affair\u201d of 1961 ultimately led to a critical clarification of both the Bank\u2019s and the government\u2019s responsibilities with respect to the conduct of monetary policy in Canada.\nMr. Coyne\u2019s legacy has profoundly influenced all of us who work at the Bank, and has made it a stronger and more accountable institution. On behalf of the Bank\u2019s Governing Council and all Bank staff, both past and present, I extend our most sincere sympathies to his wife and family."

These new notes will be available at financial institutions from coast to coast to coast starting today.\nGovernor Carney was joined at the event by Shelly Glover, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance; Marc Gr\u00e9goire, Commissioner of the Canadian Coast Guard; and Louis Fortier, Scientific Director of ArcticNet.\nThe front of the new $50 note features a portrait of Sir William Lyon Mackenzie King, while the back depicts the Arctic research icebreaker CCGS Amundsen, in port during the ceremony, as well as other imagery that reflects Canada\u2019s commitment to Arctic research and the development and protection of northern communities. Most importantly, the new $50 bill, like the rest of the polymer series, features a unique combination of state-of-the-art security features, making them the most secure bank notes ever issued in Canada.\n\u201cJust as the work of scientists on the Amundsen is expanding the frontiers of Arctic research, this new polymer series is expanding the frontiers of bank note technology,\u201d said Governor Carney.\nThe Governor encouraged Canadians to familiarize themselves with these new features, the most prominent of which are two transparent areas: one that extends from the top to the bottom of the note and contains complex holographic features, and the other in the shape of a maple leaf.\n\u201cCounterfeiting rates have been reduced by 90 per cent since 2004. Issuing this new series of bank notes enables us to continue to stay ahead of counterfeiters,\u201d Governor Carney said. \u201cAnd by regularly checking the leading-edge security features on these new notes, Canadians can help protect themselves from counterfeiting threats,\u201d he added.\nParliamentary Secretary Glover noted that much has been done in recent years to combat counterfeiting and maintain public confidence in Canada\u2019s bank notes, which helps to avoid the detrimental impact that counterfeiting can have on the integrity of an economy.\n\u201cThese new polymer notes represent an important part of this effort and a significant barrier to counterfeiting. The striking imagery of this new $50 bill reflects Canada's commitment to the North,\u201d said Parliamentary Secretary Glover.\nCommissioner Gr\u00e9goire expanded on the note\u2019s theme, saying, \u201cCanada\u2019s northern frontier has played an important role in the shaping of our national identity. And it is a true honour to have the CCGS Amundsen, Canada\u2019s Arctic research platform, illustrated on the note in this, the 50th anniversary of the Canadian Coast Guard.\u201d\u00a0He also spoke of how the Canadian Coast Guard\u2019s partnership with ArcticNet provides the global scientific community with unprecedented access to research opportunities in the North.\nWith the $50 denomination being more frequently used in automated banking machines, Canadians were also reminded that each time a new series of bank notes is issued the equipment that processes and dispenses them may require adjustments or upgrades. The Bank of Canada has worked closely with financial institutions and manufacturers of bank note processing equipment to help them make this transition to polymer.\nThe $20 note will be issued later this year, with the remaining bank notes in the series \u2013 the $5 and $10 notes \u2013 to be issued by the end of 2013.

This new note will be available at financial institutions from coast to coast to coast over the next few weeks.\nThe $100 note features a portrait of Sir Robert Borden, Prime Minister of Canada between 1911 and 1920, on the front and celebrates Canada\u2019s contributions to innovation in the field of medicine on the back. It was officially released into circulation by Governor Mark Carney at an event in Toronto, Ontario, at the MaRS Centre \u2013 a hub for public-private sector innovation and collaboration between the business and scientific communities.\nGovernor Carney was joined at the event by Dr. Ilse Treurnicht, Chief Executive Officer of MaRS Discovery District.\nDr. Treurnicht discussed the importance of creating an environment that encourages and supports innovation in fields such as health care and life sciences. \u201cSuch an environment spurs the development of Canadian expertise and sets the stage for Canadian companies to lead the way,\u201d she said. \u201cThese companies will, in turn, develop new ideas and technologies that return significant economic and social benefits, not only to Canadians but, through global partnerships, to the world.\u201d\nRemarking that the new polymer bank notes are themselves the product of Canadian ingenuity, combined with innovative technologies from around the globe, Governor Carney said the $100 note is an important step toward significantly increasing the security of Canada\u2019s bank notes. \u201cJust as the images on this note depict Canadian achievements at the frontier of medicine, the advanced security features embedded in these new polymer bills are at the frontier of bank note technology,\u201d Governor Carney said. \u201cThis will protect Canadians against tomorrow\u2019s counterfeiting threats. As well, these new notes will last at least two-and-a-half times longer than paper notes and will be recycled \u2013 saving money and being better for the environment.\u201d\n\u201cSafer, cheaper and greener: these new bank notes are a 21st-century achievement in which all Canadians can take pride and place their confidence,\u201d he concluded.\nThe new polymer bank notes, among the most advanced in the world, contain leading-edge security features that make them difficult to counterfeit but easy to verify; for example, a large transparent area extends from the top to the bottom of the note and contains complex holographic features that can be viewed from both sides.\nSince unveiling the polymer bank note series in June 2011, the Bank of Canada has been working closely with financial institutions and the manufacturers of bank note equipment to support a smooth transition to the new notes. Through its regional offices across the country, the Bank has also been working with law enforcement and retailers to ensure that front-line police officers and cash handlers are familiar with the new security features and to encourage the regular authentication of bank notes.\nThe $50 note, which was also unveiled in June, will be issued in March 2012. The $20\u00a0note will begin circulating in late 2012, followed by the $10 and $5 notes by the end of 2013. Detailed images of the notes and information on their designs will be released on their official unveiling dates."

    "Bank of Canada Releases Background Information on Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target": {
        "date": "2006-11-27",
        "link": "https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2006/11/bank-canada-releases-background-information/",
        "text": "The Bank of Canada today released the document Renewal of the Inflation-Control  Target: Background Information , which describes Canada's experience  with inflation targeting, reports on some key issues bearing on the framework  for conducting monetary policy, and identifies issues warranting further  research.\nThis release follows the 23 November announcement by the Government of Canada  and the Bank of Canada that the inflation-control target has been renewed for a  period of five years to the end of 2011. Under the agreement, the Bank will  continue to conduct monetary policy aimed at keeping inflation, as measured by  the consumer price index (CPI), at 2 per cent, with a control range of 1 to 3  per cent around this target.\nKey elements discussed in the Background Information document  include the following:\nCanada's experience with inflation targeting: Since Canada  adopted inflation targets in 1991, total CPI inflation has averaged very close  to 2 per cent, and the variability of inflation has been significantly lower  than was the case in the 15 years before inflation targeting. Success in  reducing inflation, coupled with an explicit commitment to keep inflation low,  stable, and predictable through time, has helped to anchor inflation  expectations to the 2 per cent target. A low-inflation environment has  contributed to sound economic performance and the well-being of Canadians in a  number of important ways. Consumers and businesses have been able to manage  their finances with greater certainty about the future purchasing power of their  savings and income. Nominal interest rates, both short and long term, have been  much lower and more stable. Output growth in the economy has been generally  higher and significantly more stable, while unemployment has been lower and less  variable. The more stable price environment provided by inflation targeting has  also helped the economy adjust to economic shocks, such as the global high-tech  bubble, 9/11, SARS, and the rapid rise in oil prices, allowing businesses and  households to allocate resources more efficiently.\nTotal inflation and core inflation: The inflation target  will continue to be set in terms of the 12-month increase in the total consumer  price index. This reflects its role as the most commonly used indicator of  inflation in the Canadian economy and the most relevant estimate of the cost of  living for most Canadians. Total CPI inflation, however, is subject to  considerable variability and so is not always the best indicator of the  underlying trend in inflation and, therefore, of where inflation is likely to be  in the future. For this reason, core inflation\u2014which removes volatile price  components\u2014provides a useful guide for the conduct of monetary policy. In the  context of the new inflation agreement, the Bank intends to continue using CPIX  as its preferred measure of core inflation. CPIX strips out eight of the most  volatile components of total CPI, as well as the effect of changes in indirect  taxes on the remaining CPI components. As in the past, the Bank will continue to  look at a range of measures in order to assess the underlying trend of  inflation.\nThe target time horizon: Based on recent research, the Bank  has concluded that the present policy of bringing inflation back to the 2 per  cent target within six to eight quarters (18 to 24 months) is still appropriate  generally, although specific occasions may arise in which a somewhat shorter or  longer time horizon might be appropriate. For example, the persistence of lower  observed inflation might suggest, in some instances, a shorter time horizon.  Similarly, the longer-lasting nature of some shocks, such as large asset-price  movements could, in some instances, suggest a longer horizon. A full discussion  of the shocks to the Canadian economy, and of the Bank's policy response to  them, will be provided in the Bank's Monetary Policy Reports.\nAsset prices and the inflation target: It remains the Bank's  view that no explicit recognition should be given to asset prices in the  inflation-target index, beyond the recognition already accorded the price of  housing services in the CPI. The Bank will focus on the inflation and output  consequences of any economic disturbance, including asset-price shocks, and will  continue to respond in a manner consistent with meeting its long-run inflation  objective. However, as noted above, some flexibility might be required with  regard to the time horizon over which the target is achieved. This might involve  sacrificing something in terms of inflation performance over the usual horizon,  but could lead to greater financial, economic, and inflation stability over a  somewhat longer horizon. If the Bank judged that the time horizon should be  adjusted relative to the usual six to eight quarters, it would communicate the  reasons for the change and how it planned to respond.\nIssues warranting further research: While Canada's 15 years  of experience with inflation targeting have been very positive, there remains  the question of whether the specific regime established in the 1990s will  deliver the greatest contribution to economic performance and to the well-being  of Canadians in the decades ahead. With this in mind, the Bank plans to lead a  concerted research program to learn from our experience and the experience of  others, and to examine whether and how the monetary policy framework in Canada  might be improved. Building on recent research on inflation-targeting  frameworks, the research program led by the Bank will focus on the potential  costs and benefits of targeting a lower rate of inflation or of pursuing a  price-level target instead of an inflation target. The research program will  also consider any necessary reassessment of issues covered in the past and  assessment of any new issues that may arise. Other interested researchers are  invited to join the effort. The goal is to complete this research well in  advance of the next renewal date in 2011 so as to ensure sufficient time for  open discussion of the results and their implications."

The FSB is an international agency dedicated to building a more resilient and efficient global financial system. It coordinates the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies, and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies.\nThe appointment, for a term of three years, was confirmed by G-20 Leaders at their summit in Cannes, France. \u201cI am honoured to assume this new role,\u201d said Governor Carney. \u201cMy appointment reflects the strong reputation of Canada\u2019s financial system and the leading role that Canada has played in helping to develop many of the most important international financial reforms.\u201d\nMr. Carney will remain Governor of the Bank of Canada during his chairmanship of the FSB. He succeeds Mario Draghi, who was Governor of the Bank of Italy during his term as Chairman of the Financial Stability Board and its predecessor, the Financial Stability Forum (FSF). Mr. Draghi became President of the European Central Bank on 1 November 2011.\nGovernor Carney paid tribute to Mr. Draghi\u2019s significant contributions to the promotion of international financial stability during his chairmanship. \u201cMario\u2019s tireless dedication as FSB Chairman over the past five years, during the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression, has established the FSB\u2019s central role in the global financial system,\u201d said Governor Carney. \u201cThe credibility of the FSB, and the quality and breadth of its work, are testaments to Mario\u2019s vision and leadership. The global financial system is stronger today because of his chairmanship.\u201d\nThe Governor committed to strengthen further the FSB\u2019s capacity and governance, as mandated by the G-20 Leaders, and to work closely with national authorities and international agencies to monitor the implementation of the G-20\u2019s comprehensive financial reform program.\nHe added, \u201cI am delighted that Philipp Hildebrand, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, will serve as Vice-Chair of the FSB. I look forward to working closely with Mr. Hildebrand as we continue to advance the FSB\u2019s vital work in building a more resilient and efficient financial system.\u201d\nBackground note: The Financial Stability Board was established in April 2009 as the successor to the Financial Stability Forum (FSF). The FSF was founded in 1999 by the G-7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors.\u00a0In November 2008, the Leaders of the G-20 countries called for a larger membership of the FSF. In April 2009, at the G-20 Leaders Summit in London, England, it was announced that an expanded FSF was to be re-established as the Financial Stability Board (FSB) with a broadened mandate to promote financial stability.

S. Elliott joined Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney for the unveiling ceremony.\nMinister Flaherty spoke of the importance of cash as a means of payment in the daily lives of Canadians, adding this is why it is important Canadians see their story reflected in the designs. \u201cThese bank notes evoke the country\u2019s spirit of innovation, and their designs celebrate Canada\u2019s achievements at home, around the world and in space,\u201d he said. \u201cBank notes are cultural touchstones that reflect and celebrate our Canadian experience.\u201d\nThe $100 note, which is to be issued in November 2011, features images that focus on Canadian innovations in the field of medicine: from pioneering the discovery of insulin to treat diabetes, to the invention of the pacemaker and to the role Canadian researchers have played in mapping the human genetic code. Sir Robert Borden, Prime Minister of Canada between 1911 and 1920, in an updated portrait, remains on the front of the note.\nThe $50 note, which will be issued in March of 2012, features images of the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Amundsen in the North, reflecting Canada\u2019s leading role in Arctic research. It also evokes the part that Canada\u2019s northern frontier\u2014with its vastness and splendour\u2014has played in shaping our cultural identity. An updated portrait of William Lyon Mackenzie King, the Canadian Prime Minister between 1921 and 1930 and again from 1935 to 1948, is on the front of the note.\nThe notes will contain a number of unique features that expand the frontiers of bank note security and will make them difficult to counterfeit but easy to check.

Trends include the urbanization of emerging Asia and the accompanying formation of a massive new middle class. Cyclical forces, such as accommodative monetary policies, capital inflows and credit booms, are also contributing to strong domestic demand. \u00a0In contrast, economic growth in advanced economies is listless and will be weighed down in coming years by the legacy of the financial crisis.\nThe balance between these forces has changed and may change again. \u201cLast fall, the consensus was that a faltering recovery in advanced economies was a greater risk than overheating in emerging markets,\u201d Governor Carney noted. \u201cToday, it is the opposite. Such reversals can be expected to continue.\u201d\nThe Governor identified three consequences for Canada, and discussed their implications:\nThe Governor said Canada\u2019s economic flexibility, sound macroeconomic policy and commitment to openness will help address the current global challenges and opportunities. \u201cCanada\u2019s fiscal strength and monetary policy credibility represent crucial advantages that must be preserved.\u201d"

The Bank also provided further technical and background information about  the new bank notes. More details on the security features, themes and designs of  these denominations will be unveiled in the spring of 2011. The remaining  denominations \u2013 the $20 note, followed by the $10 and $5 notes \u2013 will be  unveiled and issued by the end of 2013.\nWith the introduction of the polymer bank note series, the Bank's main focus  continues to be security. \"Canada's new bank notes will have innovative security  features that are easy to verify,\" said Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of  Canada. \"The leading-edge technology in these notes will expand the frontiers of  bank note security.\"\nIn addition to enhancing security, the new bank note series will be easier to  verify, more economical and have a reduced environmental impact. The Bank of  Canada evaluated a number of options before deciding on a new suite of security  features and on the use of polymer material \u2013 which is expected to last at least  2.5 times longer than the current cotton-paper bills.\nTo prepare for the new notes, the Bank is working closely with financial  institutions and manufacturers of bank note equipment to ensure a smooth  transition to polymer. Law-enforcement agencies and retailers will also be  important partners as the Bank introduces the polymer series. \"With these new  notes, the Bank of Canada will provide Canadians with a durable, high-quality,  secure form of payment that they can use with confidence,\" added Governor  Carney.\nMore information on the new polymer bank note series can be found in the  attached backgrounder."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly raised to 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is kept at 1/4 per cent, thus re-establishing the normal operating band of 50 basis points for the overnight rate.\nThe global economic recovery is proceeding but is increasingly uneven across countries, with strong momentum in emerging market economies, some consolidation of the recovery in the United States, Japan and other industrialized economies, and the possibility of renewed weakness in Europe. The required rebalancing of global growth has not yet materialized.\nIn most advanced economies, the recovery remains heavily dependent on monetary and fiscal stimulus. In general, broad forces of household, bank, and sovereign deleveraging will add to the variability, and temper the pace, of global growth. Recent tensions in Europe are likely to result in higher borrowing costs and more rapid tightening of fiscal policy in some countries \u2013 an important downside risk identified in the April Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Thus far, the spillover into Canada from events in Europe has been limited to a modest fall in commodity prices and some tightening of financial conditions.\nActivity in Canada is unfolding largely as expected. The economy grew by a robust 6.1 per cent in the first quarter, led by housing and consumer spending. Employment growth has resumed. Going forward, household spending is expected to decelerate to a pace more consistent with income growth. The anticipated pickup in business investment will be important for a more balanced recovery.\nCPI inflation has been in line with the Bank\u2019s April projections. The outlook for inflation reflects the combined influences of strong domestic demand, slowing wage growth, and overall excess supply.\nIn this context, the Bank has decided to raise the target for the overnight rate to 1/2 per cent and to re-establish the normal functioning of the overnight market.\nThis decision still leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in light of the significant excess supply in Canada, the strength of domestic spending, and the uneven global recovery.\nGiven the considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook, any further reduction of monetary stimulus would have to be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic developments.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 20 July 2010. A full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on 22 July 2010."

Effective immediately, the  target for the overnight rate will be the midpoint of the operating band and the  width of the operating band will revert to 50 basis points.\nThe Bank will conduct Special Purchase and Resale Agreement (SPRA) and Sale  and Repurchase Agreement (SRA) operations as necessary to reinforce the target  for the overnight rate (see Terms and Conditions).

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today announced the introduction of a new Bank of Canada  commodity price index (BCPI). 1 In order to  produce a more accurate, representative and flexible index, the methodology used  to construct the index has been changed. Instead of using a fixed-weight price  index in which the weights are updated only infrequently, the new BCPI uses a  chain Fisher price index with weights updated on an annual basis. The new Fisher  BCPI includes a broader set of commodities and is updated using recent commodity  production data.\nPlease note that the new Fisher BCPI replaces the previous fixed-weight  series. It is a weighted index of U.S.-dollar prices of commodities produced in  Canada and sold in world markets.\nSince the prices of commodities produced in Canada have important  implications for the performance of the Canadian economy, the interpretation of  developments in commodity markets is critical for the conduct of monetary  policy, and an accurate measure of overall movements in prices is essential.\nA key advantage of the new Fisher BCPI is the annual updating of the weights  (based on annual production values), so that the new index produces a more  accurate and more relevant measure of commodity price movements. In addition,  its consistency with the Canadian System of National Accounts (which is also  based on chain Fisher indexes) makes the construction of a volume measure for  Canadian commodity production possible."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is unchanged at 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent.\nGlobal economic growth has been somewhat stronger than projected, with momentum in emerging-market economies increasing noticeably. Exceptional stimulus from monetary and fiscal policies continues to provide important support in many countries. The recovery in the major advanced economies is still expected to be relatively subdued, reflecting ongoing balance sheet adjustments and the gradual withdrawal of fiscal stimulus commencing later this year. Despite recent progress, considerable uncertainty remains about the durability of the global recovery.\nIn Canada, the economic recovery is proceeding somewhat more rapidly than the Bank had projected in its January Monetary Policy Report (MPR). The profile for growth is more front-loaded than that presented in the January MPR. The Bank now projects that the economy will grow by 3.7 per cent in 2010 before slowing to 3.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.9 per cent in 2012.\nThis profile reflects stronger near-term global growth, very strong housing activity in Canada, and the Bank\u2019s assessment that policy stimulus resulted in more expenditures being brought forward in late 2009 and early 2010 than expected. At the same time, the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar, Canada\u2019s poor relative productivity performance, and the low absolute level of U.S. demand will continue to act as significant drags on economic activity in Canada. The Bank expects the economy to return to full capacity in the second quarter of 2011.\nThe outlook for inflation reflects the combined influences of stronger domestic demand, slowing wage growth, and overall excess supply. Core inflation, which has been somewhat firmer than projected in January, is expected to ease slightly in the second quarter of 2010 as the effect of temporary factors dissipates, and to remain near 2 per cent throughout the rest of the projection period. Total CPI inflation is expected to be slightly higher than 2 per cent over the coming year, before returning to the target in the second half of 2011.\nIn response to the sharp, synchronous global recession, the Bank lowered its target rate rapidly over the course of 2008 and early 2009 to its lowest possible level. With its conditional commitment introduced in April 2009, the Bank also provided exceptional guidance on the likely path of its target rate. This unconventional policy provided considerable additional stimulus during a period of very weak economic conditions and major downside risks to the global and Canadian economies. With recent improvements in the economic outlook, the need for such extraordinary policy is now passing, and it is appropriate to begin to lessen the degree of monetary stimulus. The extent and timing will depend on the outlook for economic activity and inflation, and will be consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target.\nIn accordance with the removal of the conditional commitment, there will be no additional term Purchase and Resale Agreements issued by the Bank.\nA full update of the Bank\u2019s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on 22 April 2010. The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 1 June 2010."

        "text": "While Canada is a country of immense strengths and considerable resilience, its  economy is underperforming relative to its potential, Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney said today in a speech to the Ottawa Economics Association. \"We are  not as productive as we could be. Our potential growth is slowing. Moreover,  this is occurring as the very nature of the global economy in which we have  previously thrived is under threat,\" Governor Carney noted.\nThe cost of the decline in potential growth could amount to a cumulative loss  of income of almost $30,000 per Canadian over the next decade.\nThe Governor spelled out two imperatives\u2013one domestic, the other  international\u2013to secure strong, sustainable, and balanced economic growth for  Canada. On the one hand, Canada needs to boost its \"abysmal\" productivity  record. \"While there is always more to do, governments have put in place  conditions for a productivity revival,\" Governor Carney said. \"Business, thus  far, has disappointed.\"\nCanada's productivity challenge is made more pressing by an international  economic landscape that is changing dramatically. Bank of Canada research  illustrates the substantial gains of implementing the G-20 framework launched  last November in St. Andrews, Scotland, as well as the considerable costs of  disregarding it. Ultimately, securing strong, sustainable, and balanced global  economic growth will require changes in behaviour as well as policy adjustments  on several fronts, Governor Carney said.\nThe Governor advised that now is not the time for Canada to rest on its  laurels or to take an open global economy for granted. \"The twin challenges of  boosting Canadian productivity and of implementing the G-20 framework globally  are daunting,\" he acknowledged. \"But the gains are considerable.\"\nGovernor Carney stressed that the Bank of Canada is committed to tackling  these important issues. \"We have a broad research agenda on productivity. We are  working with our domestic and international partners to reform the global  financial system. We are active participants in G-20 framework discussions, not  merely because they offer the best outcome for the global economy but also  because they are in Canada's interests,\" he said. In concluding, the Governor  noted that, most fundamentally, the Bank has an unwavering commitment to price  stability."

The Bank Rate is unchanged at 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent.\nInformation received since the Bank's April Monetary Policy Report (MPR) is broadly consistent with the Bank's medium-term outlook for output and inflation in Canada. The economy is undergoing major restructuring in a number of sectors. The already significant output gap will continue to widen through the third quarter, putting downward pressure on inflation. The Bank continues to expect that the global and Canadian recoveries will be more muted than usual.\nIn recent weeks, financial conditions and commodity prices have improved significantly, and consumer and business confidence have recovered modestly. If the unprecedentedly rapid rise in the Canadian dollar (which reflects a combination of higher commodity prices and generalized weakness in the U.S. currency) proves persistent, it could fully offset these positive factors.\nThe outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty. While the underlying macroeconomic risks are roughly balanced, the Bank judges that, as a consequence of operating at the effective lower bound, the overall risks to its inflation projection remain tilted slightly to the downside.\nConditional on the outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target.\nThe Bank retains considerable flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy at low interest rates, consistent with the framework outlined in the April MPR.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 21 July 2009.

        "text": "Since the October 2002 Monetary Policy Report, both core and total CPI  inflation have been well above the 2 per cent inflation target. In this  environment, inflation expectations have edged up.\nIn view of the domestic inflation situation and the underlying momentum of  domestic demand, the Bank raised its target overnight rate on each of its last  two policy announcement dates by 25\u00a0basis points, bringing it to  3.25\u00a0per\u00a0cent.\nEconomic, financial, and geopolitical uncertainty has figured prominently in  the global economic picture over the past six months. Some of the geopolitical  and financial uncertainty has lifted more recently, and the Bank expects that it  will continue to recede. However, over the near term, a degree of global  economic uncertainty remains, and in Canada there is uncertainty about the  possible economic impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),  particularly in the Greater Toronto Area. Overall, the risks confronting the  world economy now appear to be better balanced compared with last autumn, and by  year-end, business and household confidence levels should be higher.\nEconomic activity should begin to strengthen towards the end of this year and  through 2004, particularly in North America. In Canada, most of the small amount  of economic slack that is likely to open up during 2003 will have closed by the  end of 2004.\nCore inflation is expected to remain near 3 per cent through mid-2003. It is  projected to fall to about 2 per cent by early 2004. Total CPI inflation will  continue to be importantly affected by swings in crude oil prices.\nThe Bank continues to believe that further reductions in monetary stimulus  will be necessary over time to return inflation to the 2 per cent target and to  sustain output levels close to capacity. The timing and pace of further  increases in policy interest rates will depend on the strength of domestic  demand, the evolution of inflation expectations, and the pace of economic  expansion in the United States and in overseas economies."

    "Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 1/4 per cent and, conditional on the inflation outlook, commits to hold current policy rate until the end of the second quarter of 2010": {

        "link": "https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2009/04/fad-press-release-2009-04-21/",
        "text": "The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to 1/4 per cent, which the Bank judges to be the effective lower bound for that rate. The Bank Rate is correspondingly lowered to 1/2\u00a0per\u00a0cent. The deposit rate - the rate paid on deposits held by financial institutions at the Bank of Canada - is left unchanged at 1/4 per cent and provides the floor for the overnight rate. Details of the Bank's operating framework at the effective lower bound can be found here.\nIn an environment of continued high uncertainty, the global recession has intensified and become more synchronous since the Bank's January Monetary Policy Report Update, with weaker-than-expected activity in all major economies. Deteriorating credit conditions have spread quickly through trade, financial, and confidence channels. While more aggressive monetary and fiscal policy actions are underway across the G20, measures to stabilize the global financial system have taken longer than expected to enact. As a result, the recession in Canada will be deeper than anticipated, with the economy projected to contract by 3.0 per cent in 2009. The Bank now expects the recovery to be delayed until the fourth quarter and to be more gradual. The economy is projected to grow by 2.5 per cent in 2010 and 4.7 per cent in 2011, and to reach its production capacity in the third quarter of 2011. Given significant restructuring in a number of sectors, potential growth has been revised down. The recovery will be importantly supported by the Bank's accommodative monetary stance.\nThe Bank expects core inflation to diminish through 2009, gradually returning to the 2 per cent target in the third quarter of 2011 as aggregate supply and demand return to balance. Total CPI inflation is expected to trough at -0.8 per cent in the third quarter of 2009 and return to target in the third quarter of 2011. While the underlying macroeconomic risks to the projection are roughly balanced, the Bank judges that, as a consequence of operating at the effective lower bound, the overall risks to its inflation projection are tilted slightly to the downside.\nWith monetary policy now operating at the effective lower bound for the overnight policy rate, it is appropriate to provide more explicit guidance than is usual regarding its future path so as to influence rates at longer maturities. Conditional on the outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. The Bank will continue to provide such guidance in its scheduled interest rate announcements as long as the overnight rate is at the effective lower bound.\nTo reinforce its conditional commitment to maintain the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent, the Bank will roll over a portion of its existing stock of one- and three-month term Purchase and Resale Agreements (PRAs) into six- and twelve-month terms at minimum and maximum bid rates that correspond to the target rate and the Bank Rate, respectively. These longer-term PRAs will be issued according to the schedule released today.\nToday's decision to lower the policy rate by 25 basis points brings the cumulative monetary policy easing to 425 basis points since December 2007. It is the Bank's judgment that this cumulative easing, together with the conditional commitment, is the appropriate policy stance to move the economy back to full production capacity and to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target. The Bank retains considerable flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy at low interest rates, consistent with the framework to be outlined in the Bank's Monetary Policy Report on 23 April.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 4 June 2009."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-half of a percentage point to 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3/4\u00a0per\u00a0cent.\nThe outlook for the global economy has continued to deteriorate since the Bank's January Monetary Policy Report Update, with weaker-than-expected activity in major economies. The nature of the U.S. recession, with very weak auto and housing sectors, is particularly challenging for Canada.\nStabilization of the global financial system remains a precondition for the global and Canadian economic recoveries. The timely implementation of ambitious plans in some major countries to address toxic assets and recapitalize financial institutions will be critical in this regard.\nNational accounts data for the fourth quarter of 2008 and other indicators of aggregate demand point to a sharper decline in Canadian economic activity and a larger output gap through the first half of 2009 than projected in January. Potential delays in stabilizing the global financial system, along with larger-than-anticipated confidence and wealth effects on domestic demand, could mean that the output gap will not begin to close until early 2010. These factors imply a slightly lower profile for core inflation than was projected in the January MPRU.\nThe effects of the recent aggressive monetary and fiscal policy actions in Canada and other major economies will begin to be felt in the second half of this year and will build through 2010. Once the global financial system stabilizes and global growth recovers, the underlying strength of the Canadian economy and financial sector should ensure a more rapid recovery in Canada than in most other industrialized economies.\nThe Bank's decision to lower its policy rate by 50 basis points today brings the cumulative monetary policy easing to 400\u00a0basis points since December 2007. Consistent with returning total CPI inflation to 2 per cent, the target for the overnight rate can be expected to remain at this level or lower at least until there are clear signs that excess supply in the economy is being taken up.\nGiven the low level of the target for the overnight rate, the Bank is refining the approach it would take to provide additional monetary stimulus, if required, through credit and quantitative easing. In its April Monetary Policy Report, the Bank will outline a framework for the possible use of such measures.\nThe Bank will continue to monitor carefully economic and financial developments in judging to what extent further monetary stimulus will be required to achieve its 2\u00a0per\u00a0cent inflation target over the medium term.\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 21 April 2009.

The Update reviews economic and financial trends in  the context of Canada's inflation-control strategy.\nThe July Update highlights a number of unanticipated developments  that have changed the outlook for economic activity and inflation in Canada.\nInflation and inflation expectations have eased, and near-term domestic  activity has been weakened by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an  isolated case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and  weaker-than-expected foreign demand for Canadian products. As well, the  substantial rise in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar  will have a dampening effect on the future growth of demand for Canadian goods  and services. As a result, more slack is developing in the economy than was  previously expected. It now appears that, by the end of this year, core  inflation will fall below the 2 per cent target.\nTo support growth in domestic demand and aggregate levels of economic  activity, the Bank left its target for the overnight rate unchanged on 3 June,  and lowered it by 25 basis points to 3\u00a0per\u00a0cent on 15\u00a0July.\nThe Bank expects that growth in Canada's economy will strengthen towards the  end of 2003 and through 2004. Growth during 2004 will likely be higher than  previously projected, suggesting that the economic slack that is expected to  develop in 2003 will be largely absorbed by the end of next year.\nThe Bank will closely monitor the strength of domestic and external demand  with a view to keeping inflation on track to meet the 2\u00a0per\u00a0cent target over the  medium term."

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 1\u00a01/4\u00a0per\u00a0cent.\nThe outlook for the global economy has deteriorated since the Bank's December interest rate announcement, with the intensifying financial crisis spilling over into real economic activity. Heightened uncertainty is undermining business and household confidence worldwide and further eroding domestic demand. Major advanced economies, including Canada's, are now in recession and emerging-market economies are increasingly affected. Energy prices have fallen as a result of substantially weaker global demand.\nStabilization of the global financial system is a precondition for economic recovery. To that end, governments and central banks are taking bold and concerted policy actions. There are signs that these extraordinary measures are starting to gain traction, although it will take some time for financial conditions to normalize. In addition, considerable monetary and fiscal policy stimulus is being provided worldwide.\nCanadian exports are down sharply, and domestic demand is shrinking as a result of declines in real income, household wealth, and consumer and business confidence. Canada's economy is projected to contract through mid-2009, with real GDP dropping by 1.2\u00a0per\u00a0cent this year on an annual average basis. As policy actions begin to take hold in Canada and globally, and with support from the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar, real GDP is expected to rebound, growing by 3.8\u00a0per\u00a0cent in 2010.\nA wider output gap through 2009 and modest decreases in housing prices should cause core CPI inflation to ease, bottoming at 1.1\u00a0per\u00a0cent in the fourth quarter. Total CPI inflation is expected to dip below zero for two quarters in 2009, reflecting year-on-year drops in energy prices. With inflation expectations well-anchored, total and core inflation should return to the 2\u00a0per\u00a0cent target in the first half of 2011 as the economy returns to potential.\nAgainst this background, the Bank today lowered its policy rate by 50\u00a0basis points, bringing the cumulative monetary policy easing to 350\u00a0basis points since December 2007. Guided by Canada's inflation-targeting framework, the Bank will continue to monitor carefully economic and financial developments in judging to what extent further monetary stimulus will be required to achieve the 2\u00a0per\u00a0cent target over the medium term.

Global financial markets remain severely strained. Measures taken by major governments are beginning to encourage credit flows, although it will take some time before conditions in financial markets normalize. In addition, a series of recently announced monetary and fiscal policy actions will also support global economic growth.\nWhile Canada's economy evolved largely as expected during the summer and early autumn, it is now entering a recession as a result of the weakness in global economic activity. The recent declines in terms of trade, real income growth, and confidence are prompting more cautious behaviour by households and businesses.\nAll of these factors imply a lower profile for core inflation than had been projected at the time of the last Monetary Policy Report in October.\nSeveral factors are helping to counterbalance the negative drag from the global economic and financial developments. The depreciation of the Canadian dollar will continue to provide an important offset to the effects of weaker global demand and lower commodity prices. As well, money markets and overall credit conditions in Canada are responding to significant and ongoing efforts to provide liquidity to the Canadian financial system.\nIn light of the weakening outlook for growth and inflation, the Bank of Canada lowered its policy interest rate by a total of 75 basis points in October and by an additional 75 basis points today.

    "Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 2 1/4 per cent": {
        "date": "2008-10-21",
        "link": "https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2008/10/bank-of-canada-lowers-overnight-rate-target/",
        "text": "The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to 2 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 2 1/2 per cent.\nThree major interrelated developments are having a profound impact on the Canadian economy. First, the intensification of the global financial crisis has led to severe strains in financial markets. The associated need for the global banking sector to continue to reduce leverage will restrain growth for some time. Second, the global economy appears to be heading into a mild recession, led by a U.S. economy already in recession. Third, there have been sharp declines in many commodity prices. The outlook for growth and inflation in Canada is now more uncertain than usual.\nConsistent with the G7 Plan of Action, major economies have announced extraordinary measures to stabilize their financial systems. These initiatives will be pivotal to resuming the flow of credit to support global economic growth. Canada's economy and strong financial system will benefit directly from these actions.\nThe weaker outlook for global demand will increase the drag on the Canadian economy coming from exports. Lower commodity prices will also dampen the outlook, working through a deterioration in Canada's terms of trade to moderate domestic demand growth. The marked tightening in Canadian credit conditions in recent weeks will restrain business and housing investment. The Bank expects growth to be sluggish through the first quarter of next year, then to pick up over the rest of 2009 and to accelerate to above-potential growth in 2010 supported by improving credit conditions, the lagged effects of monetary policy actions and stronger global growth. The recent sizeable depreciation of the Canadian dollar will also provide an important offset to the effects of weaker global demand and lower commodity prices. Overall, the Bank projects average annual growth in real GDP of 0.6 per cent in both 2008 and 2009, and 3.4 per cent in 2010.\nWith excess supply projected to build throughout 2009 and lower assumed energy prices, inflationary pressures will ease significantly relative to the projection in the July Monetary Policy Report Update. Core inflation is now projected to remain below 2 per cent until the end of 2010. Total CPI inflation should peak during the third quarter of 2008, fall below 1 per cent in the middle of 2009, and then return to the 2 per cent target by the end of 2010.\nIn the face of diminished inflationary pressures, the Bank of Canada lowered its policy interest rate by 50 basis points on 8 October, acting in concert with other major central banks. This extraordinary move, combined with today's announcement, brings the cumulative reduction in our target for the overnight rate to 75 basis points since the Bank's last fixed announcement date. These actions provide timely and significant support to the Canadian economy. The cumulative reduction in the Bank's policy rate since last December is now 225 basis points.\nIn line with the new outlook, some further monetary stimulus will likely be required to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term. The evolution of the financial crisis, its impact on the global economy and the timing of the effects of the various extraordinary measures being taken to address it pose significant risks to the projection on both the upside and the downside.\nThe Bank will publish the details of its new projection for the economy and inflation, including all the key risks to the projection, in the Monetary Policy Report on 23 October 2008.\nInformation note:\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 9 December 2008."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 3 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 3 1/4 per cent.\nSince the April Monetary Policy Report (MPR), economic developments have been broadly in line with expectations. However, the balance of risks to the Bank's April projection for inflation in Canada has shifted slightly to the upside. Although the composition of U.S. growth has not been favourable for demand for Canadian goods and services, overall, global growth has been stronger and commodity prices have been sharply higher than expected. At the same time, many of the downside risks to inflation identified in the April MPR have eased, while the evolution of credit conditions has been in line with expectations. The risk remains that potential growth will be weaker than assumed.\nWith the decline in first-quarter GDP, the Canadian economy is judged to have moved into excess supply, which is expected to increase this year. Consistent with the April MPR, the Bank continues to project that economic growth will pick up this year and accelerate in 2009, owing in part to a firming of U.S. demand and accommodative monetary policy in Canada.\nIf current levels of energy prices persist, total CPI inflation will rise above 3 per cent later this year. However, with the Canadian economy operating in excess supply, core inflation is expected to remain below 2 per cent through 2009. Both total and core inflation should converge on 2 per cent in 2010 as the economy returns to balance.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Bank now judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriately accommodative to bring aggregate demand and supply into balance and to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target. There continue to be important downside and upside risks to inflation in Canada, which the Bank will monitor closely.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 15 July 2008. The Bank will publish an updated projection for the economy and inflation, and its assessment of the risks, in the Monetary Policy Report Update on 17 July 2008."

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3 1/4 per cent.\nGrowth in the global economy has weakened, reflecting the effects of a sharp slowdown in the U.S. economy and ongoing dislocations in global financial markets. Growth in the Canadian economy has also moderated as buoyant growth in domestic demand, supported by high employment levels and improved terms of trade, has been substantially offset by the fall in net exports. While both total and core CPI inflation were running at about 1.5\u00a0per\u00a0cent at the end of the first quarter, the underlying trend of inflation is judged to be about 2 per cent, consistent with an economy that was operating just above its production capacity.\nThe Bank is now projecting a deeper and more protracted slowdown in the U.S. economy. This has direct consequences for the Canadian economic outlook, with declining exports projected to exert a significant drag on growth in 2008. In addition, tightening credit conditions and softening sentiment are expected to moderate business investment and consumer spending. Nevertheless, domestic demand is projected to remain strong, supported by firm commodity prices, high employment levels, and the effect of cumulative easing in monetary policy.\nThe Bank projects that the Canadian economy will grow by 1.4 per cent this year, 2.4\u00a0per\u00a0cent in 2009, and 3.3\u00a0per\u00a0cent in 2010. Consistent with this growth profile, the economy moves into excess supply in the second quarter of 2008, and spare capacity continues to increase through early next year. However, a gradual recovery in the U.S. economy, a return to more normal credit conditions, and accommodative monetary policy should generate above-potential growth and bring the economy back into balance around mid-2010.\nThe recent price-level adjustments for automobiles and the effect of past changes in indirect taxes will keep measured inflation below target through 2008. The emergence of excess supply in the economy should keep downward pressure on inflation through 2009. Both core and total inflation are projected to move up to 2 per cent in 2010, as the economy moves back into balance. There are both upside and downside risks to the Bank's new projection for inflation; these risks appear to be balanced.\nIn line with this outlook, some further monetary stimulus will likely be required to achieve the inflation target over the medium term. Given the cumulative reduction in the target for the overnight rate of 150 basis points since December, the timing of any further monetary stimulus will depend on the evolution of the global economy and domestic demand, and their impact on inflation in Canada.\nA full analysis of economic and financial developments, trends, and risks will be set out in the Bank's Monetary Policy Report, to be published on 24 April 2008.\nThe Bank's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 10 June 2008."

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3\u00a03/4\u00a0per\u00a0cent.\nInformation received since the January Monetary Policy Report Update (MPRU) indicates that economic growth in Canada through the four quarters of 2007 was broadly in line with expectations. Domestic demand has remained buoyant, as rising commodity prices and high employment have continued to support income growth. Canada's net exports weakened further in the fourth quarter, reflecting the slowing U.S. economy and the impact of the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar. Overall, the Canadian economy remained above its production capacity at year-end. Core and total CPI inflation \u2013 at 1.4\u00a0per\u00a0cent and 2.2\u00a0per\u00a0cent, respectively, in January \u2013 have also been consistent with the Bank's expectations.\nAt the same time, there are clear signs that the U.S. economy is likely to experience a deeper and more prolonged slowdown than had been projected in January. This stems from further weakening in the residential housing market, which is adversely affecting other sectors of the U.S. economy and contributing to further tightening in credit conditions. The deterioration in economic and financial conditions in the United States can be expected to have significant spillover effects on the global economy. These developments suggest that important downside risks to Canada's economic outlook that were identified in the MPRU are materializing and, in some respects, intensifying.\nThe Bank now judges that the balance of risks around its January projection for inflation has clearly shifted to the downside, and, as a result, the Bank is lowering the target for the overnight rate. Further monetary stimulus is likely to be required in the near term to keep aggregate supply and demand in balance and to achieve the 2\u00a0per\u00a0cent inflation target over the medium term.\nThe Bank will publish a new projection for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the Monetary Policy Report on 24\u00a0April\u00a02008.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 22\u00a0April\u00a02008."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 4 1/4 per cent.\nIn the second half of 2007, the Canadian economy grew broadly in line with the Bank's expectations in the October Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Despite some slowing in growth in the fourth quarter, the Canadian economy continues to operate above its production capacity. Both core and total CPI inflation have been lower than projected in the MPR, largely reflecting a price-level adjustment related to increased competitive pressures in the retail sector stemming from the level of the Canadian dollar.\nFinancial market conditions have deteriorated since October, leading to a tightening of credit conditions in industrial countries. Given this, and a deeper, more prolonged decline in the U.S. residential housing sector, the 2008 outlook for the U.S. economy is now significantly weaker than at the time of the October MPR.\nFor Canada, the effects of the weaker U.S. economic outlook will lead to additional downward pressure on export growth. However, despite tighter credit conditions, domestic demand in Canada is projected to remain strong. This strength is supported by continued income growth associated with the increase in commodity prices since October, which has led to further gains in our terms of trade. Overall, the Bank now projects weaker growth in 2008 than was expected in October, with the economy moving into modest excess supply in the second quarter of this year. Somewhat stronger growth in 2009 brings the Canadian economy back into balance in early 2010. The inflation projection has also been revised down since October, especially for 2008, primarily reflecting the price-level adjustment noted above and the recent one-percentage-point cut in the GST. Both core and total CPI inflation should fall below 1 1/2 per cent by the middle of this year before returning to the 2 per cent target by the end of 2009. On the whole, the Bank judges that the risks to this inflation projection are roughly balanced.\nIn line with this outlook, the Bank has decided to lower the target for the overnight rate and further monetary stimulus is likely to be required in the near term to keep aggregate supply and demand in balance and to return inflation to target over the medium term.\nThe Bank's detailed projection for the economy and inflation, and risks to the projection, will be published in the Monetary Policy Report Update on 24 January 2008.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 4\u00a0March\u00a02008."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 4 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 4 1/2 per cent.\nSince the October Monetary Policy Report (MPR), there have been a number of economic and financial developments that have a bearing on the prospects for output and inflation in Canada.\nConsistent with the outlook in the MPR, the global economic expansion has remained robust and commodity prices have continued to be strong. The Canadian economy has been growing broadly in line with the Bank's expectations, reflecting in large part underlying strength in domestic demand. However, both total CPI inflation and core inflation in October, at 2.4 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively, were below the Bank's expectations, reflecting increased competitive pressures related to the level of the Canadian dollar. The Bank now expects inflation over the next several months to be lower than was projected in the MPR. In the context of exceptional volatility in global financial markets, the Canadian dollar spiked well above parity with the U.S. dollar in November, but it has recently traded closer to the 98-cent-U.S. level assumed in the October MPR.\nOverall, the Canadian economy continues to operate above its production capacity. Given the strength of domestic demand and weak productivity growth, there continue to be upside risks to the Bank's inflation projection.\nHowever, other developments since October suggest that the downside risks to the Bank's inflation projection have increased. Global financial market difficulties related to the valuation of structured products and anticipated losses on U.S. sub-prime mortgages have worsened since mid-October, and are expected to persist for a longer period of time. In these circumstances, bank funding costs have increased globally and in Canada, and credit conditions have tightened further. There is an increased risk to the prospects for demand for Canadian exports as the outlook for the U.S. economy, and in particular the U.S. housing sector, has weakened.\nAll these factors considered, the Bank judges that there has been a shift to the downside in the balance of risks around its October projection for inflation through 2009. In light of this shift, the Bank has decided to lower the target for the overnight rate. At its next interest rate decision in January, the Bank will assess all economic and financial developments and the balance of risks. A full projection for the economy and inflation will be published in the Monetary Policy Report Update on 24\u00a0January\u00a02008.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 22\u00a0January\u00a02008."

The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 4\u00a03/4\u00a0per\u00a0cent.\nNear-term prospects for economic growth outside North America appear to be slightly stronger than anticipated in the July Monetary Policy Report Update (MPRU), while near-term economic prospects for the United States are weaker than expected. It now seems likely that the adjustment in the U.S. residential housing sector will be more pronounced and protracted, exacerbated by recent developments in financial markets. On balance, this implies weaker demand for Canadian exports than had been expected at the time of the July MPRU.\nIn Canada, total and core CPI inflation in July, at 2.2 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively, continued to be above the inflation target but generally in line with the Bank's expectations. The Canadian dollar has also largely traded in the range assumed in the July MPRU. At the same time, the pace of economic growth in the first half of this year was above the Bank's expectations. It now appears that the Canadian economy is operating further above its production potential than was estimated in July. Domestic demand remains robust, buoyed by a continuing strong labour market and higher-than-expected increases in home sales and prices. However, recent developments in financial markets have led to some tightening of credit conditions for Canadian borrowers, which should temper growth in domestic demand.\nAgainst this background, the Bank judges that the current level of the target for the overnight rate is appropriate. However, there are significant upside and downside risks to the outlook for inflation. On the upside, there is a possibility that household demand in Canada could be stronger than anticipated, while on the downside the ongoing adjustment in the U.S. housing sector could be more severe and spill over to the U.S. economy more broadly. In addition, there is uncertainty about the extent and duration of the tightening of credit conditions in Canada and, hence, about the tempering effect this will have on growth in domestic demand.\nThe Bank will continue to closely monitor evolving economic and financial developments. A full update of the Bank's outlook for growth and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be set out in the Monetary Policy Report, to be published on 18 October 2007.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 16 October 2007."

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 4 3/4 per cent.\nEconomic growth and inflation in Canada in the first half of this year have been stronger than expected in the April Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Final domestic demand has remained the key driver of economic growth in Canada, bolstered by firm commodity prices. The Bank judges that the economy is now operating further above its production potential than was projected at the time of the April MPR. Both total CPI and core inflation have been higher than projected in April and are above the 2 per cent inflation target. Longer-term interest rates have increased and the Canadian dollar has appreciated sharply, moving well above the trading range assumed in the last MPR.\nThe Canadian economy is now projected to grow by 2.5 per cent in 2007, somewhat stronger than was expected in April, and to grow somewhat more slowly in 2008 and 2009 than previously projected. In this new projection, higher interest rates across the yield curve and a higher assumed range for the Canadian dollar of 93 to 95.5 cents U.S. act to moderate growth in 2008 and 2009 to an average of about 2 1/2 per cent. This brings aggregate demand and supply in Canada back into balance in 2009.\nInflation is projected to be slightly higher and more persistent than in the April MPR. However, as excess demand diminishes, total CPI and core inflation should decline to 2 per cent by early 2009.\nThere are both upside and downside risks to the Bank's inflation projection. The main upside risk is that household demand in Canada could be stronger than expected. The main downside risks are related to the higher Canadian dollar and the ongoing adjustment in the U.S. housing sector. In the context of the Bank's new projection, these risks appear to be roughly balanced.\nIn line with this outlook, the Bank is raising the target for the overnight rate to 4 1/2 per cent. Some modest further increase in the overnight rate may be required to bring inflation back to the target over the medium term.\nAn analysis of the Bank's outlook for growth and inflation, including economic and financial developments and risks to the projection, will be set out in the Monetary Policy Report Update, to be published on 12\u00a0July\u00a02007.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 5 September 2007."

Growth in Canada in the first half of 2006 appears to have been a little stronger and the Canadian dollar has traded in a somewhat higher range than was envisaged in the April MPR. As well, there was a further shift in the composition of demand towards consumption and away from exports. Total CPI inflation has remained above the 2 per cent target, mainly because of increases in consumer energy prices, while core inflation moved up to 2\u00a0per\u00a0cent slightly sooner than expected. All factors considered, the Canadian economy is currently judged to be operating just above its production capacity.\nIn 2007 and 2008, growth is projected to be a little weaker than was set out in the April MPR. The additional strength that has developed in domestic demand is expected to persist into next year, but this should be more than offset by a weaker outlook for net exports, owing primarily to the recent strength of the Canadian dollar. With some anticipated moderation in U.S. growth, combined with past interest rate and exchange rate increases, the Canadian economy is projected to return to its production capacity by the end of 2008. Total CPI inflation is expected to average just over 1\u00a01/2\u00a0per\u00a0cent from mid-2006 to mid-2007, with the reduction in the Goods and Services Tax lowering the inflation rate by 0.6 percentage points over this period. Inflation should then return to the 2\u00a0per\u00a0cent target. Core inflation should remain at about 2 per cent throughout the projection period.\nIn line with the Bank's largely unchanged outlook, the current level of the target for the overnight rate is judged at this time to be consistent with achieving the inflation target over the medium term. The Bank will monitor global and domestic economic and financial developments, including adjustments in the Canadian economy, relative to its projection. Risks to the projection remain roughly balanced, with a small tilt to the downside later in the projection period related to global imbalances.\nFurther details of the Bank's outlook for output and inflation will be discussed in the Monetary Policy Report Update, to be released on 13\u00a0July\u00a02006.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 6\u00a0September\u00a02006."

Global economic growth  is expected to be a little higher than previously anticipated, but a weaker  near-term outlook for the U.S. economy has curbed the near-term prospects for  Canadian exports and growth, the Governor said. The Bank's base-case projection  now calls for average annual GDP growth of 2.8 per cent in 2006, 2.5 per cent in  2007, and a return to 2.8 per cent in 2008.\nGovernor Dodge pointed out that Ontario's economy will be affected more than  the national average because of the close ties between the province's industrial  base and the two sectors of the U.S. economy that are slowing the most:  automobiles and housing. \"Nevertheless, modest growth in Ontario's economy  should persist,\" Governor Dodge said. \"Seventy per cent of Ontario's economic  activity comes from the service sector, and that sector remains in good  shape.\"\nThe Governor went on to address some of the longer-term structural challenges  facing Ontario, as well as some of the policies that will be important to secure  Ontario's economic future. In particular, the Governor stressed the need for  sound policies on the development of human resources and ongoing improvements in  the province's infrastructure."

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 4\u00a01/4\u00a0per\u00a0cent.\nThe global economy has been growing at a robust pace, exhibiting a little more momentum than had been anticipated. This global strength and the associated higher prices of many commodities, together with strong domestic demand in Canada, have produced solid growth in the Canadian economy at a pace consistent with the Bank's outlook in the January Monetary Policy Report Update. At the same time, global competition and the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar continue to pose challenges for a number of sectors of the economy. All factors considered, the Canadian economy is judged to be operating at, or just above, its production capacity. High energy prices have kept total CPI inflation in Canada somewhat above the Bank's 2 per cent target. Core inflation has remained below 2 per cent owing to persistent downward pressure from prices of imported consumer goods. Against this backdrop, the Bank decided to raise its target for the overnight rate.\nLooking forward, the Bank projects that the Canadian economy will grow by 3.1 per cent in 2006, 3.0 per cent in 2007, and 2.9 per cent in 2008. Total CPI inflation is projected to average close to 2 per cent in 2007 and 2008 (excluding the effect of any changes in the GST). The Bank judges that the risks to its projection are roughly balanced, with a small tilt to the downside later in the projection period.\nIn line with the Bank's outlook for the Canadian economy, some modest further increase in the policy interest rate may be required to keep aggregate supply and demand in balance and inflation on target over the medium term. The Bank will closely monitor evolving developments in the Canadian economy in light of the cumulative increase in the policy interest rate since last September. A full analysis of economic developments, trends, and risks will be provided in the Monetary Policy Report, to be published on 27 April 2006.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 24 May 2006."

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 3 3/4 per cent.\nInformation received since the last interest rate announcement on 6 December indicates that the Canadian and global economies are evolving essentially in line with the Bank's expectations as set out in the October Monetary Policy Report (MPR). The Canadian economy continues to adjust to global developments and to the associated changes in relative prices. CPI inflation, at 2.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2005, was lower than expected primarily because of lower gasoline prices. As anticipated, core inflation remained stable at 1.6 per cent. The level of economic activity at year end was close to expectations.\nThe outlook for growth and inflation in Canada is similar to that in the October MPR. The Bank continues to judge that the Canadian economy is operating at its production capacity and will grow roughly in line with production potential through 2007. CPI and core inflation should return to the 2\u00a0per\u00a0cent target by the first half of 2007. Risks to the Bank's projection remain balanced for 2006 and tilted to the downside through 2007 and beyond. Further details of the Bank's outlook for output and inflation will be discussed in the Monetary Policy Report Update, to be released on 26\u00a0January\u00a02006.\nIn line with the Bank's base-case projection and current assessment of risks, some modest further increase in the policy interest rate would be required to keep aggregate supply and demand in balance and inflation on target over the medium term.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 7 March 2006."

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 3\u00a01/2\u00a0per\u00a0cent.\nSince the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 4 March, both core and total CPI inflation have remained well above the Bank's 2\u00a0per\u00a0cent inflation target and measures of inflation expectations have edged up. Economic growth in Canada in the second half of 2002 and in early 2003 eased from its earlier vigorous pace, but domestic demand has remained firm and employment gains have continued. As a result, the level of economic activity in Canada remains near full production capacity.\nThe near-term outlook for the global and Canadian economies is somewhat weaker than was expected at the time of the Bank's last interest rate announcement. Nonetheless, with geopolitical uncertainties diminishing and world oil prices declining significantly, the risks confronting the global economy are now better balanced. The Bank thus expects that economic expansion in Canada and the United States will begin to strengthen towards the end of 2003 and will strengthen further in 2004. In view of the domestic inflation environment and the expectation that the Canadian economy will be operating near potential in 2004, the Bank has decided to further reduce the amount of monetary stimulus by raising the target for the overnight rate.\nIn light of near-term economic uncertainties, the Bank will be closely monitoring domestic demand and the inflation environment, as well as the pace of recovery in the United States and the overseas economies. An elaboration of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation will be set out in the Monetary Policy Report, to be published on 23\u00a0April\u00a02003.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 3\u00a0June\u00a02003."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 3 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 3 1/4 per cent.\nConsumer price data since the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 21 January indicate that both core and total CPI inflation remain well above the Bank's 2 per cent inflation target. Persistent above-target inflation rates over the past few months reflect not only the impact of higher-than-expected crude oil and natural gas prices, but also continuing increases in auto insurance premiums and price pressures in certain sectors such as housing, food, and some services. More broadly, as noted in the January 2003 Monetary Policy Report Update, the fact that relative price increases are having a large impact on measures of trend inflation reflects an underlying firmness in the price-setting environment.\nEconomic growth in Canada moderated in the final three months of 2002, largely because of weaker exports, most notably a decline in automotive shipments to the United States. However, final domestic demand, particularly household expenditure, continued to expand at a robust pace. Owing to upward revisions to measures of Canadian economic growth in previous quarters, the level of economic activity at the end of 2002 was slightly higher than had been expected. Accordingly, the level of economic activity in Canada remains near full production capacity. In these circumstances, the persistence of above-target rates of inflation has elevated the risk of an increase in inflation expectations.\nSignificant geopolitical and global economic uncertainties continue to overhang the short-run economic outlook. Nonetheless, the Bank continues to expect demand for Canadian output to pick up in the second half of 2003 and into 2004, as global uncertainties diminish. In light of domestic inflation pressures, the expectation that Canadian economic activity will remain near potential in 2003, the stimulative stance of monetary policy, and improved conditions in capital markets, the Bank has decided to raise the target for the overnight rate.\nAs indicated in the MPR Update, further reductions in monetary stimulus will be required to return inflation to the target over the medium term. The timing and pace of increases in policy interest rates will continue to depend on a number of considerations. These include the strength of demand pressures, the evolution of inflation expectations, the impact on confidence of geopolitical and global economic uncertainties, and the way in which developments in the Middle East affect demand and inflation, both globally and in Canada. The Bank will continue to monitor closely all these factors.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 15\u00a0April\u00a02003.  The Monetary Policy Report will be published on 23\u00a0April\u00a02003."

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 3 per cent.\nSince the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 4 June, the economic recovery in Canada has remained stronger than expected and has broadened across sectors. This momentum has been reflected in continued strong growth in employment and spending by households, as well as in some pickup of investment in machinery and equipment. As a result, the economy has been moving towards full production capacity more quickly than anticipated. Core inflation, which was 2.2 per cent in May, has remained a little higher than projected.\nThere are both positive and negative risks to the Canadian economic outlook. On the positive side, with considerable monetary stimulus in the economy, growth in Canada could very well continue to exceed expectations. On the negative side, the main risk is the marked uncertainty associated with recent global corporate and financial market developments and their potential effects on confidence and world economic growth.\nThe Bank's decision to raise interest rates represents a further measured reduction in the substantial amount of monetary stimulus in the economy. In the period ahead, the Bank will remain focused on taking the necessary actions to achieve the inflation target of 2 per cent over the medium term.\nAn elaboration of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation that were the basis for today's interest rate decision will be set out in the Monetary Policy Report Update, to be published on 24 July 2002.

Corporal Earle Bailey and Sergeant Peter Hadley, of the Windsor RCMP Commercial Crime Section, were honoured last night at an awards gala during the annual conference of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police held in Ottawa.\nThe recipients of the Award of Excellence were selected for their initiative and determination during a counterfeiting investigation conducted between September 2003 and March 2004. This investigation resulted in the seizure of approximately $1.6 million in counterfeit bank notes, and the dismantling of a large counterfeit production facility in the Greater Toronto Area. The efforts of Corporal Bailey and Sergeant Hadley also led to the prosecution of a major counterfeiter.\nThe Bank of Canada's Law-Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence was established in 2004 to recognize the work of Canadian law-enforcement personnel in deterring and preventing the counterfeiting of bank notes. \"The Bank believes that it is important to recognize the efforts of the Windsor RCMP investigators, since they prevented large volumes of counterfeit notes from entering into circulation,\" said Pierre Duguay, the Bank's Deputy Governor responsible for the issuance of bank notes. \"The success of this investigation also reflects a renewed emphasis on counterfeit detection and deterrence by Canada's national police force and other law-enforcement agencies.\"\nA photo from the awards presentation will be available on Canada NewsWire."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 2 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 2 3/4 per cent.\nInformation received since the October Monetary Policy Report (MPR) suggests that economic activity in Canada has been broadly in line with the Bank's expectations, with core inflation remaining below the 2 per cent inflation target. Although oil prices have declined, global economic growth prospects have moderated slightly. The U.S. dollar has depreciated further against major floating currencies, including the Canadian dollar. If exchange rates were to persist at current levels, and if all other economic and financial factors were to remain unchanged, there would be a dampening effect on aggregate demand for Canadian goods and services.\nIn light of these considerations, the Bank decided to leave the target for the overnight rate unchanged. With the overnight rate at 2 1/2 per cent, a considerable amount of monetary stimulus remains in the Canadian economy. As well, the underlying trends in the global economy continue to point to solid economic growth. Accordingly, the Bank will be paying close attention to the prospects for factors that affect pressures on capacity and, hence, inflation.\nThe main risks and uncertainties around the outlook for the Canadian economy remain those that the Bank identified and analyzed in the MPR. They relate to global imbalances, the realignment of currencies, commodity prices, the growing presence of emerging market economies such as China and India, and the related adjustments within the Canadian economy. The Bank will monitor these factors, with a view to keeping aggregate demand and supply in balance in order to achieve the inflation target.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 25\u00a0January\u00a02005.

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 2\u00a01/2\u00a0per\u00a0cent.\nData received since the July Monetary Policy Report Update indicate that Canada's economic growth in the first half of this year was somewhat stronger than the Bank had been expecting, largely as a result of more robust external demand for Canadian goods and services. The Bank judges that the economy is now operating close to its production capacity. Core inflation, which was 1.9 per cent in July, is consistent with this assessment. Total CPI inflation, at 2.3 per cent in July, has remained above expectations, primarily because oil prices have been persistently higher than the Bank had assumed.\nLooking forward, the Bank expects aggregate demand to grow at, or marginally above, the rate of growth of production capacity. With the economy operating close to its capacity, monetary stimulus needs to be reduced to avoid a buildup of inflationary pressures. In this context, the Bank decided to raise its target for the overnight rate.\nUncertainties around the economic outlook continue to relate primarily to three factors: the estimated size of the output gap, the future growth of Canadian exports and imports, and the overall effect on the Canadian economy of current and future movements in the world prices of oil and non-energy commodities. In conducting monetary policy, the Bank will continue to pay attention to these factors as it assesses the evolving prospects for pressures on capacity and inflation.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 19\u00a0October\u00a02004.  The Monetary Policy Report will be published on 21 October 2004."

The note also  incorporates enhanced versions of security features with which Canadians are  already familiar, such as raised ink (intaglio), fine-line printing, and  improved fluorescence under ultraviolet lighting. To help blind and  vision-impaired individuals identify the new $100 bank note, it has a tactile  feature (raised dots) and large, high-contrast numerals.\nSince the unveiling of the new $100 note at a ceremony in Halifax on 28  January 2004, the Bank of Canada has been working with law-enforcement agencies,  financial institutions, and the retail and hospitality industries to train their  employees on the note's security features.\n\"Everyone has a part to play in protecting our country's bank notes,\" said  Paul Marsh, Staff Sergeant of the RCMP. \"Together, we can fight counterfeiting.  Bank notes have security features that are reliable and easy to use. It's good  business practice to check your notes when you receive them\u2014just as you count  your change.

While inflation is exhibiting some volatility, underlying price pressures and the presence of spare capacity point to a core rate of inflation that will likely persist below the inflation target late into 2005. Despite stronger global economic growth, the rapid appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. currency has cut into the overall growth of aggregate demand for Canadian goods and services through weaker exports and increased imports. In addition, although employment growth has continued to be vigorous, recent indicators of domestic demand in the fourth quarter of 2003 have been somewhat weaker than projected. As a consequence, the output gap at the end of 2003 appears to be somewhat larger than the Bank was expecting. In light of these demand and inflation factors, and the likelihood that they will persist through this year and into 2005, the Bank has decided to lower the target for the overnight rate to provide additional support for growth in aggregate demand and thus help return inflation to the target over the medium term.\nAn elaboration of the Bank's views on the outlook for inflation, the economy, and the uncertainties surrounding aggregate demand growth will be provided in the Monetary Policy Report Update, to be released on 22 January 2004.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 2\u00a0March\u00a02004."

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3 per cent.\nSince the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 15 July, inflation pressures have continued to ease. Core inflation has declined below the 2 per cent inflation target earlier than the Bank anticipated, and it appears that lower inflation will persist over the coming months.\nAs expected, economic growth was interrupted in the second quarter of the year, and the pace of growth in the third quarter will likely remain below potential. This recent weakness reflects the impact of a number of near-term factors such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the effect of an isolated case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) on exports of Canadian beef and cattle, the power blackout in Ontario, and the forest fires in Western Canada.\nNotwithstanding these developments, there are clear indications that conditions are in place for a strengthening of economic growth. Final domestic demand growth has remained robust and the adverse effects of the near-term factors are beginning to dissipate. The economic rebound in the United States began earlier, and will be stronger, than previously expected. As well, the tone of capital markets remains favourable. Overall, despite current weakness, the accumulation of economic evidence to date reinforces the Bank's view that growth in the Canadian economy will strengthen towards the end of 2003 and through 2004.\nWith today's decision, policy interest rates will support the return to levels of economic activity consistent with achieving an overall balance of aggregate demand and supply and thus keeping inflation near the target over the medium term.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 15\u00a0October\u00a02003.

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 3\u00a0per\u00a0cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3\u00a01/4\u00a0per\u00a0cent.\nIn recent months, there have been a number of unanticipated developments that bear on the outlook for inflation and economic activity in Canada. Both inflation and inflation expectations have declined more rapidly than the Bank had expected. Near-term domestic economic activity has been undercut by the effects of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and an isolated case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in Canada. Foreign demand for Canadian products has also been weaker than earlier anticipated. In addition, the rapid and sizable appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. currency will tend to have a dampening effect on the demand for tradable Canadian goods and services.\nIn this context, inflation pressures have eased and more economic slack is opening up in Canada than was previously projected. Today's interest rate reduction will provide support for domestic demand growth, and consequently for levels of aggregate demand consistent with keeping inflation on a track to meet the 2\u00a0per\u00a0cent target over the medium term.\nLooking ahead, the Bank still expects that growth in the Canadian economy will strengthen towards the end of 2003 and through 2004, underpinned by domestic demand, by the favourable conditions in capital markets, and by the anticipated rebound in the U.S. economy. An elaboration of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation will be provided in the Monetary Policy Report Update, to be released this Thursday, 17\u00a0July.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 3\u00a0September\u00a02003."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 3\u00a01/4\u00a0per\u00a0cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 3\u00a01/2\u00a0per\u00a0cent.\nData released since the Bank's last interest rate announcement indicate that both core and total CPI inflation declined in April more than expected. Some of this decline was due to transitory factors, most notably the rebate on electricity prices in Ontario. The Canadian economy continued to expand in the first quarter of 2003, reflecting firmness in domestic demand. This was broadly in line with expectations in the April Monetary Policy Report. More recent developments bearing on aggregate demand for Canadian output, including continuing weakness in the U.S. and global economies and concerns about the economic impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), point to the likelihood of some near-term softness in the Canadian economy. There has also been significant adjustment in the value of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, including the Canadian dollar.\nLooking forward, it remains the Bank's view that growth in the Canadian economy will be underpinned by the underlying strength of domestic demand and by the expected rebound in the U.S. economy towards the end of 2003 and through 2004. And, while there is likely to be some increase in core inflation in the coming months as a result of the unwinding of the transitory factors mentioned above, it now appears that both core and total CPI inflation will return to the 2\u00a0per\u00a0cent target somewhat earlier than the Bank expected in April. In these circumstances, the Bank has decided to leave its policy interest rates unchanged.\nThe Bank will monitor closely inflation developments, the strength of domestic demand, and signs of recovery in the U.S. and global economies, and will continue to assess the effects of the appreciation of the Canadian dollar on aggregate demand and price levels in Canada. An update of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation will be provided in the July Monetary Policy Report Update.\nThe Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 15\u00a0July\u00a02003.

        "text": "Today, the Bank of Canada released its October Monetary Policy Report, in which it discusses economic and financial trends in the context of Canada's inflation-control strategy.\nThe Canadian economy has been expanding strongly so far this year and is now operating fairly close to its full production capacity. Consumer price inflation has risen above the 2\u00a0per\u00a0cent target and is expected to rise further before year-end because of high oil prices and a number of other relative price movements. What is important for monetary policy is that these one-off influences on specific prices not feed more generally into price and wage inflation.\nThe Canadian economy has grown more rapidly than those of all other G-7 countries over the past year. Annualized growth exceeded 5 per cent in the first half of 2002\u2014well above the growth of the economy's potential. We estimate that Canada's economy grew at an annualized rate of about 4 per cent in the third quarter. Thus, there has been a significant reduction in the amount of excess supply in the economy so far this year.\nLooking ahead, global economic, financial, and geopolitical uncertainties are likely to moderate the rate of Canada's economic growth over the next three quarters. Growth should come in at the bottom of, or slightly below, the 3 to 4 per cent range that we anticipated in the last Update.\nThe output gap is very small. Assuming the uncertainties now clouding the outlook dissipate in the second half of next year, we expect growth to accelerate to above potential at that time, absorbing the remaining small amount of excess supply.\nThe Bank's core measure of inflation is running above our earlier projections. This largely reflects sharp increases in home and auto insurance premiums and, in Ontario, electricity prices. Core inflation is also being pushed up by strong demand for housing.\nAll told, core inflation is expected to peak at about 3 per cent by the end of this year. But, as the one-time influences fade, core inflation is expected to decline in the second half of 2003, provided those one-time factors do not feed into price and wage inflation more generally.\nThe Canadian economy is now operating not far from its capacity. In order to sustain non-inflationary growth, we will need to continue to remove monetary stimulus before the excess supply in the economy is completely absorbed. The pace and extent of this action will depend on the balance of domestic and external developments and on their implications for pressures on capacity and inflation in Canada."

The key elements of that strategy are sound and credible macroeconomic policies, including an appropriate exchange rate regime, and a robust financial infrastructure.\nMr. Dodge pointed out that \"when it comes to crisis management and resolution, the international community is still hard at work. Many issues on how to put in place a framework for promoting orderly debt restructuring remain outstanding. But significant progress is being made.\"\nIn this context, he suggested that the Action Plan endorsed by the G-7 countries last month was an important step. He highlighted, in particular, the plan's recognition of the need for clear limits on official lending. The Bank views such limits as key in promoting more realistic expectations among debtors and creditors and thus providing the right incentives for the timely resolution of crises.\nThe Governor said that a lot more needs to be done to ensure that the ideas of the Action Plan are effectively implemented. This is important. \"The stakes are high\u2014not only because of the economic costs, but because of the social costs and the human suffering caused by financial crises. And, in an increasingly integrated world, more than ever, we are all in this together.\""

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today released its semi-annual Monetary Policy Report, in which it discusses economic and financial trends in the context of Canada's inflation-control strategy.\nCanada's economic outlook has improved significantly since the November Monetary Policy Report. Indeed, information on the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of 2002 indicates that the recovery in the Canadian economy began sooner and has been considerably stronger than anticipated.\nThe Bank now projects that the Canadian economy will grow between 3\u00a01/2 and 4\u00a01/2\u00a0per\u00a0cent at annualized rates in the first half of 2002. It is expected to continue to expand at a rate above that of its production capacity in the second half of 2002 and in 2003. Thus, the economy is expected to be operating at full capacity in the second half of 2003.\nIn light of this outlook, the Bank began to reduce the substantial amount of monetary stimulus in the economy, raising the target for the overnight rate of interest by 25\u00a0basis points to 2.25\u00a0per\u00a0cent on 16\u00a0April.\nNonetheless, important risks and uncertainties remain. Given the amount of monetary stimulus in place, growth in Canada could be stronger than projected. It is also possible that growth in household spending may not be as strong as anticipated, if more of the recent strength than assumed was borrowed from future expenditures. There is also uncertainty regarding the timing and strength of the pickup in business investment and exports, and how developments in the Middle East could affect crude oil prices and the global economy.\nThe challenge for monetary policy over the remainder of this year and through 2003 is to help the economy move back to, and then sustain, levels of production at capacity by taking actions aimed at achieving the Bank's 2\u00a0per\u00a0cent target for inflation control. This means reducing, in a timely and measured manner, the substantial amount of stimulus in place."

A robust recovery appears to be underway in Canada.

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 2\u00a01/4\u00a0per\u00a0cent.\nIn the November Monetary Policy Report, the Bank indicated that the timing and extent of the recovery in economic activity in Canada this year would depend on geopolitical developments and the pace of the return of consumer and business confidence to normal levels. Since then, uncertainty has been reduced as geopolitical developments have evolved positively and consumer confidence has improved. However, business confidence both in Canada and abroad remains weak.\nAlthough the Canadian economy is expected to gather momentum in the course of this year, it will nonetheless remain in excess supply through 2002, putting downward pressure on inflation. Core inflation, which declined to 1.7 per cent in November, is likely to stay around its current level through mid-2002 and to average just under 1 1/2 per cent in the second half of the year. Total CPI inflation, which fell sharply to 0.7 per cent in November, is expected to remain below the core rate until late 2002.\nThe interest rate cut announced today brings the cumulative easing in the target for the overnight rate over the past 12 months to 3 3/4 percentage points.

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 2 1/2 per cent.\nRecent economic developments in Canada have been broadly consistent with expectations at the time of the last policy interest rate announcement on 23 October, as presented in the November Monetary Policy Report. Accordingly, the Bank continues to anticipate that the economy will be operating with excess capacity throughout 2002. Core inflation, which slowed to 2.2 per cent in October, is thus expected to decline further to about 1 1/2 per cent in the second half of 2002. Total CPI inflation, which dropped to 1.9 per cent in October, is expected to remain below core inflation in 2002, if energy prices stay at or below their levels in early September.\nToday's interest rate reduction provides additional support for growth in domestic demand, consistent with returning inflation to the Bank's 2-per-cent inflation target over the medium term. The cumulative reduction in policy interest rates since the beginning of 2001 is now 3 1/2 percentage points. This represents a substantial amount of monetary stimulus which, in the period ahead, will work to counteract the weakness in aggregate demand.\nIt is still too early to characterize the economic outlook with great assurance, given ongoing uncertainties. The November Monetary Policy Report set out the Bank's two working assumptions, which are that there will be no further major escalation of terrorism and that consumer and business confidence will return to normal levels in the second half of 2002. Geopolitical developments since then have been consistent with these assumptions.\nThe Bank's next scheduled date for announcing policy interest rates is 15 January 2002.

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3 per cent.\nOver the course of the summer, a more pronounced weakening trend in economic activity became evident in Canada and globally. The terrorist attacks of 11 September appear to have exacerbated this trend. As a consequence, levels of economic activity in Canada through the second half of this year and the first half of next year will be further below the economy's potential output than previously expected. This will result in persistent downward pressure on inflation through much of next year. Core inflation, which was 2.3 per cent in September, is now expected to move down below 2 per cent in early 2002. Total CPI inflation, which was 2.6 per cent in September, should also decline below 2 per cent by early 2002, if energy prices remain at or below their early-September levels.\nToday's interest rate cut, which brings the total reduction in policy interest rates since the beginning of the year to 3 percentage points, is intended to underpin confidence and provide additional support for domestic demand growth through 2002, consistent with keeping inflation near the Bank's target of 2 per cent over the medium term. In this environment of exceptional uncertainties about geopolitical developments and business and household confidence, the Bank will continue to monitor economic developments very closely.\nThe Monetary Policy Report will be published on 7 November 2001.

Similar surveys were undertaken in over 45 other countries during the same month, and the central banks of many of those countries are also releasing their results today. This worldwide effort was coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which is issuing a press release today that summarizes highlights of the aggregated global turnover. 1 Surveys have been conducted by the Bank of Canada every three years since 1983, and the results of those surveys are shown in the tables included with this release.\nAll financial institutions in Canada active in the wholesale foreign exchange and derivatives markets were surveyed. These consisted of 28 financial institutions and 5 foreign exchange and fixed-income brokers. With respect to foreign exchange, the survey covered spot transactions, outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps, 2 currency swaps, and over-the-counter (OTC) options. The interest rate products covered were forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, and OTC options. Participants were also asked to identify transactions by currency and type of counterparty.\n\u00a0\nHighlights of the 2001 Survey"

The schedule of announcement dates for the remainder of this year and for 2002 is:\nAll announcements will continue to be made at 9 a.m. (ET).\nIn the interest of providing more timely information, the Bank also announced that, beginning in 2002, its semi-annual Monetary Policy Report will be released approximately one week after the announcement dates in April and October, and the Update to the report will be released about one week after the announcement dates in January and July. These reports will therefore be available about one week earlier than has been the practice in the past. Both the Monetary Policy Report and the Update reflect the economic developments and outlook underlying the interest rate decision that precedes their publication. The Bank will announce the specific release dates of the Monetary Policy Report and the Update for 2002 before the end of this year.\n\"The Bank's overall experience with a fixed schedule for announcing monetary policy actions has been very favourable,\" said Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge. \"We believe that scheduled announcement dates have contributed both to the effectiveness of monetary policy and to more focused public commentary on the economic situation in Canada.\""

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate 1 by one-quarter of one percentage point to 4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 4 1/4 per cent. With today's action, the total reduction in interest rates by the Bank this year amounts to 1 3/4 percentage points.\nEconomic data released since the Bank's last policy interest rate announcement on 17 July suggest that the pace of growth of the Canadian economy has been slower than expected. In part, this slowing reflects reduced demand from abroad for Canadian manufactured goods and primary products. The most important factor in this regard has been the ongoing weakness in the U.S. economy, particularly in capital spending. As well, economic growth outside North America has slowed significantly. Within Canada, growth in final domestic demand has softened, and the adjustment of inventory levels in some sectors, especially in telecommunications manufacturing, is not as far advanced as had been expected.\nAs a consequence of these developments, the Bank now expects economic growth in the third and fourth quarters of this year to be below potential, resulting in a lower level of activity than earlier expected. This implies reduced pressures on production capacity and inflation through the rest of this year and into 2002.\nIn July, total CPI inflation fell sharply to 2.6 per cent, largely because of declines in gasoline and natural gas prices. While core inflation increased slightly, to 2.4 per cent, the Bank still projects consumer price inflation to fall to about 2 per cent by the end of the year as a result of reduced pressures in product and labour markets.\nIn these conditions of slower-than-expected growth and associated easing in inflation pressures, today's interest rate reduction, together with the monetary stimulus already in place, is intended to provide support for domestic demand growth. This is expected to contribute to moving the economy, in the second half of next year, back towards levels of activity consistent with keeping inflation near the Bank's target of 2 per cent. Given the continuing uncertainties in the global economy, particularly the timing and strength of the recovery in investment in the United States, as well as uncertainty surrounding domestic demand in Canada, the Bank will continue to monitor developments closely.\nThe Bank's next scheduled date for announcing policy interest rates is 23 October 2001."

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 4 1/2 per cent.\nThe slower pace of economic growth in Canada, largely stemming from developments in the United States, continued through the second quarter of 2001. As a result, pressures on production capacity have eased, thus reducing inflation pressures. Core inflation, which is currently a little above 2 per cent, is projected to move down to about 2 per cent in the second half of this year. Total CPI inflation, which has lately been well above the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control target range, is expected to fall in the coming months to about 2 per cent by the end of the year. Recent declines in the prices of gasoline, natural gas and crude oil are mitigating the risk that high energy prices earlier this year could more broadly affect Canadian consumer prices.\nToday's rate cut brings the total reduction in interest rates by the Bank this year to 1 1/2 percentage points. This cumulative reduction will underpin domestic economic growth in the face of weaker-than-anticipated economic conditions outside North America and continuing uncertainty about the timing and strength of the recovery in investment in the United States. The Bank continues to expect that the pace of growth in Canada will increase in the second half of 2001, with further gains in 2002. This would be consistent with keeping inflation close to the inflation-control target of 2 per cent through 2002.

At the same time, final domestic demand in Canada has continued to exhibit underlying momentum. Overall, the pace of expansion in the first half of this year has fallen below the growth rate of potential output, leading to some slack in the economy. These conditions should put downward pressure on core inflation, 2 which is expected to fall from above 2 per cent currently to just below 2 per cent by the end of 2001. Total CPI inflation, which has recently been above the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control target range because of rising energy prices, is expected to remain above 3 per cent over the next few months, before moving down to about 2 per cent by the end of the year.\nIn these circumstances, today's reduction in interest rates will support aggregate demand in the economy consistent with keeping inflation close to the Bank's inflation-control target of 2 per cent over the medium term.\nThe Bank continues to view the possibility that the economic slowdown in the United States could last longer than anticipated as the main risk to the outlook for the Canadian economy. At the same time, given the sustained increases in energy prices, the Bank will need to be vigilant for signs of broader effects on consumer prices generally.\nThe Bank's next scheduled date for announcing policy interest rates is 17 July 2001.

The operating band for the overnight rate 1 is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank's target for the overnight rate is reduced to 4 3/4 per cent.\nSince late 2000, the pace of economic expansion in Canada has slowed to a rate below the economy's long-run growth potential. Information received since 6 March, the Bank's last fixed announcement date, confirms that this slowing is broadly in line with the Bank's expectations. The slowdown has largely been a consequence of the marked easing in the pace of U.S. economic growth, while final domestic demand has maintained its underlying momentum. Overall, the Canadian economy is expected to be operating somewhat below capacity by the middle of 2001, putting downward pressure on inflation. Core inflation, currently 2 per cent, is thus expected to ease. The rate of increase in the total CPI, currently close to 3 per cent, is expected to move down to 2 per cent by the end of 2001.\nIn light of the slowing pace of growth and the movement towards a position of excess supply, today's interest rate reduction, together with earlier reductions announced in January and March, is intended to support growth in aggregate demand, consistent with the Bank's policy objective of keeping inflation close to the midpoint of its 1 to 3 per cent target range over the medium term.\nIt remains the Bank's view that, following the slowdown in the first half of this year, Canada's economic growth will strengthen in the second half and in 2002. This expected pickup reflects a number of factors, including completion of the current inventory adjustment, continuing investment in new technology, recent tax cuts, the easing in domestic monetary conditions and, most importantly, the resumption of stronger U.S. economic growth. Given the uncertainties related to the timing and strength of the U.S. rebound, the Bank will continue to monitor developments closely.\nA detailed explanation of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation will be set out in the Monetary Policy Report to be published on 1 May 2001.

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank's target for the overnight rate is reduced to 5 per cent.\nSince 23 January, the Bank's last fixed announcement date, there have been indications that the slowdown in the U.S. economy in the first half of 2001 could be more pronounced than expected, and there is a risk that weakening confidence could delay the U.S. recovery. In Canada, recent information suggests that the positive underlying momentum in the economy at the end of 2000 was somewhat less strong than had been previously estimated, and that pressures on productive capacity and inflation are lower as a result.\nToday's action was taken in light of these developments and related uncertainties. The reduction in interest rates, together with rising disposable incomes bolstered by recent tax reductions, will help to underpin domestic demand. The Bank remains of the view that the overall pace of economic activity in Canada will rebound in the second half of the year. This will lead to a level of economic activity that is consistent with maintaining the core rate of inflation close to 2 per cent, the midpoint of the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control target range.

Information on consumer price inflation for December released last week indicates that core inflation, at 1.9 per cent, has moved up near the midpoint of the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control target range sooner than expected. The rate of increase in the total CPI has remained above the top end of the target range, reflecting the large increases in energy prices over the past year.\nRecent information indicates that the outlook for the U.S. economy has weakened more abruptly than had been anticipated. This development, together with other information received since the Bank's Monetary Policy Report last November, suggests that growth in Canadian output this year is likely to slow to a rate close to potential growth, whereas three months ago economic growth was expected to be above potential.\nIn the Bank's judgment, today's interest rate reduction will help maintain a balance between aggregate demand and supply in the economy and keep core inflation near the 2 per cent midpoint of the target range. The Bank projects that inflation measured by the total CPI will move down to a rate close to core inflation in the second half of this year, on the assumption that world energy prices stabilize at or below present levels.\nGiven current uncertainties, the Bank will continue to closely watch evolving domestic and external economic developments with a view to preserving the low inflation environment that has benefited the Canadian economy.\nThe Monetary Policy Report Update will be published on 6 February 2001.

It represents Canada's participation in peacekeeping activities as well as the remembrance of all Canadians who participated in past wars. A picture of Sir John A. Macdonald remains on the front of the new note.\n\"Canada's new bank notes will display subject matter chosen with input from Canadians across the country,\" said Mr. Thiessen. \"I am extremely proud of our newest bank note series, which is distinguished by new anti-counterfeiting features, world-class designs, and a unique durable tactile feature to assist the blind and vision-impaired. Raising public awareness of our currency is an important preventive measure against counterfeiting.\"\nThe new notes will contain many new sophisticated security features designed to thwart counterfeiters. Since the current note series was introduced in 1986, significant technological advances in bank note production have made it possible to incorporate better security features into paper currency. This comes at a time when affordable high-resolution colour copiers, inkjet printers, and computer scanners have increased the potential for counterfeiting.\nA major enhancement to the new series is the addition of a durable tactile feature that will greatly improve the ability of the blind and vision-impaired to recognize different denominations.\n\"Currency is a national symbol and a fitting place to capture some of the many events, scenes and people that have shaped our history and our lives as Canadians,\" said Deputy Prime Minister Herb Gray as he announced the new bank note themes.\nThe images on the backs of the notes are changing but the Queen and prime ministers who are featured on the front of the current notes will remain, with new portraits. The notes will be the same size, and the existing dominant colours on each denomination will be maintained.\nThe new themes were chosen after consultation with thousands of Canadians who expressed their views about Canada's significant achievements and aspirations.\nThe new note titles and the subject matter that will appear on the backs are:\nChildren from primary schools across Canada supported the launch of the new series with their interpretations of the themes.

While external demand for Canadian products has moderated, reflecting the recent slowing in the United States economy, growth in domestic demand remains robust.\nThe latest information on consumer price inflation was broadly in line with the Bank's expectations. In October, core inflation moved up slightly to 1.5 per cent, remaining in the lower half of the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control target range. The rate of increase in the total consumer price index remained close to the top end of the target range, reflecting the sharp increase in energy prices over the past year.\nMonetary conditions have supported the growth of aggregate demand, and pressures on the economy's production capacity are expected to increase. At the same time, as pointed out in the November Monetary Policy Report, the economy's ability to expand without generating rising inflationary pressures could be greater than estimated. Accordingly, the Bank will continue to assess carefully the balance of aggregate demand and supply in the economy and the risks to the future trend of inflation.\nThe Bank will also pay close attention to any signs that higher energy prices are being passed through to other prices in the economy and to inflation expectations, as well as to any potential inflationary effect from the lower Canadian dollar.\nIn the Bank's judgment, the factors at work in the economy point to core inflation rising to the midpoint of the target range over the coming year.\nThe next scheduled date for a Bank Rate announcement is 23 January 2001.

The Bank will continue to post interest rate information on the Bank of Canada pages of Bridge, Reuters and Bloomberg financial wire services.\nPublication of Extracts from the Minutes of the Board of Directors' Meeting to be discontinued \nThe implementation of fixed announcement dates will create eight new announcements a year that will be integrated with the Bank's other key monetary policy publications, such as the semi-annual Monetary Policy Report and the semi-annual Monetary Policy Report Update, and with speeches and other public pronouncements by the Governor and other members of the Governing Council. The purpose is to provide a more regular, frequent, and continuous process of public communication on the Canadian economic and financial situation and its implications for monetary policy. In the context of this more frequent and forward-looking calendar of public communications, publication of the Extracts from the Minutes of the Board of Directors' Meeting, which reports on the Bank's economic and financial briefings to the Board at its previous meeting, would be dated and redundant. Therefore, following their release in early November, the Bank will discontinue publishing the Extracts. 1\nCalendar of monetary policy announcements and publications"

Although counterfeiting of Canadian bank  notes remains at low levels, last year it cost Canadians more than $4 million  dollars.\nThe last Canadian note series was introduced 15 years ago. Significant  technological advances in bank note production since then have made it possible  for the Bank to incorporate better security features into paper currency. This  comes at a time when affordable high-resolution colour copiers, inkjet printers,  and computer scanners have increased the potential for counterfeiting.\n\"The new notes will incorporate state-of-the-art security features that will  make Canadian bank notes even more secure than they are now. Each new series  contains more sophisticated security features to protect Canadians from the risk  of receiving counterfeit notes,\" said Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen.  \"Canadians should also know that they will be able to hold and use existing  notes for as long as they want; the current notes will remain legal tender even  after the new notes are introduced.\"\nA major enhancement to the new series is the addition of a tactile feature  that will greatly improve the ability of the blind and vision impaired to  recognize different denominations.\n\"We are proud that Canada is one of the first countries in the world to add a  durable tactile feature to its notes,\" said Vangelis Nikias of the Canadian  National Institute for the Blind. \"When the Bank of Canada began the process of  developing the new notes, there was a concerted effort to take into  consideration the real needs of blind and vision-impaired Canadians.\"\nThe Bank has been consulting with Canadians across the country to ensure that  the new designs reflect Canada's culture, history, and achievements. The results  of that extensive national consultation have been reflected in the selection of  subject matter that will be incorporated into the new note designs.\nThe subject matter approved by the Minister of Finance for the new notes will  be announced in November.\nThe Bank has been working with financial institutions and equipment  manufacturers to ensure that the introduction of the new notes will not require  major changes to note-handling facilities and equipment.\nAlthough the current images will change, the new notes will be the same size,  and the existing dominant colours on each denomination will be maintained. In  addition, the Queen and the Prime Ministers currently featured on the notes will  remain on the same denominations but there will be new portraits.\nWith the introduction of the new bank notes, the Bank of Canada will also be  intensifying its educational and awareness programs. These programs provide  information on currency and counterfeit detection to cash handlers, law  enforcement agencies and the general public.\n\"One of the most effective ways to reduce counterfeiting is to have a  well-informed public, especially those individuals who work with cash,\" said  Gilbert Marois, Assistant Director of Currency Education at the Bank of  Canada.\nThe first redesigned note, the $10 denomination, will be put into circulation  in January 2001. The new series will include a $5 note that will be issued later  in 2001, and the remaining new notes ($20, $50, and $100) will be introduced  over the next two to three years.\nA $1000 note will not be issued. In May 2000, the Bank of Canada began the  withdrawal of $1000 notes as part of the federal government's fight against  money laundering and organized crime."

The new system will replace the current approach to announcing changes to the Bank Rate under which the Bank can, in principle, announce an adjustment on any business day in the year.\nIn releasing the details of the plan, the Bank said that adopting fixed announcement dates will improve the implementation and effectiveness of Canadian monetary policy.\nThe basic features of the new approach are:\nFollowing consultation with interested Canadians on the implementation of this approach, the Bank will make public, in late October, the specific announcement dates through to the end of 2001. The new system of fixed announcement dates will go into effect in November 2000.\nThe Bank expects that there will be a number of benefits from fixed announcement dates that will make monetary policy more effective. In particular, fixed dates will reduce uncertainty in financial markets associated with not knowing exactly when the Bank might announce an interest rate change. They should also focus greater attention on the economic and monetary situation in Canada; put greater emphasis on the medium-term perspective that underlies monetary policy; and increase the Bank's transparency, accountability, and ongoing dialogue with the public. Together, these improvements should contribute to better public understanding of the factors influencing monetary policy and increase the public's ability to anticipate the direction of policy.\nUnder the new approach, the Bank would still have the option of acting between fixed announcement dates, but it would exercise this option only in the event of extraordinary circumstances.\nBy adopting fixed announcement dates, the Bank of Canada will join many other central banks in the industrialized countries, including the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Swedish Riksbank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, all of which use a fixed-date approach to announcing interest rate changes."

The operating band for the overnight rate was correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 6 per cent.\nIn its latest Monetary Policy Report, released last week, the Bank took note of the strength of demand in Canada from both international and domestic sources, some early signs of pressures on capacity limits, and the need to lean against these trends in order to preserve the low and stable inflation environment that has been benefiting the Canadian economy.\nAn important source of this strong growth in demand has been the U.S. economy. Yesterday\u2019s action by the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise its target level for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points underscores the strength of that economy and the continued risk of demand and inflation pressures spilling over from the United States into Canada.\nThis move by the Bank of Canada reflects the judgment that a tightening in monetary conditions in Canada is warranted, given that the underlying momentum of demand growth and the high levels of activity risk putting excessive pressure on the economy\u2019s capacity limits, and thus on inflation.\nIt is through the Bank\u2019s commitment to a low and stable inflation environment that monetary policy can best contribute to sustained economic expansion in Canada, which will increase the likelihood of lower unemployment and improved productivity."

In announcing its decision, the Federal Reserve expressed further concern that increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth of the U.S. economy's production capacity, posing inflation risks.\nStrong U.S. demand has been benefiting the Canadian export sector. Increased export sales, together with the robust momentum of domestic spending in Canada, have led to a more rapid economic expansion than expected. While the core measure of Canadian inflation remains in the lower half of the Bank's inflation-control target range of 1 to 3 per cent, the strengthening pace of economic expansion has been rapidly absorbing production capacity and runs the risk of putting excessive pressure on capacity limits. In addition, the recent sharp rise in energy prices has pushed the increase in the total CPI to 2.7 per cent and is adding to input costs for other products.\nThis adjustment in the Bank Rate is designed to resist any tendency for these developments to lead to an increase in the trend of inflation in Canada.\nIt is by taking timely action, as required, to keep future inflation inside the 1 to 3 per cent target range that the Bank of Canada can help to ensure a sustainable expansion of economic activity and employment."

Notwithstanding the recent good set of economic indicators, the competitive global environment and the absence of any signs of pressure on domestic production capacity point to continued low inflation in Canada.

The top of the band, the Bank Rate, is the rate charged by the Bank on LVTS overdraft loans to financial institutions. The bottom of the band is the interest rate the Bank of Canada pays on any LVTS balances held overnight by those institutions.

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today welcomed the announcement by the Canadian Payments  Association that full operation of the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) will  begin on 4 February 1999. The LVTS is a major milestone in the reduction of risk  in Canada's payment system and will bring Canada into line with international  best practices for handling large-value payments.\nThe LVTS is a real-time system designed to handle large-value or  time-critical payments. It will form the core of the national payment system and  will substantially reduce systemic risk. Systemic risk refers to the risk of  domino or spillover effects that could arise if one financial institution is  unable to fulfil its payment obligations in a timely fashion. This could lead to  other financial institutions being unable to fulfil their obligations in the  payments system or elsewhere in the financial system.\nThe Bank of Canada worked closely with the Canadian Payments Association and  its members in ensuring that sound risk containment mechanisms were incorporated  into the LVTS. The new system provides its participants and their customers with  the certainty that once a payment message has passed the system's risk-control  tests, the transaction will settle on the books of the Bank of Canada on the  same day regardless of what happens to any of the participants subsequently. As  a result, LVTS participants will be able to offer to their customers  unconditional and irrevocable intra-day access to funds received over the LVTS.  This contrasts with the current arrangements where final settlement of payment  obligations among financial institutions does not occur until around noon on the  following business day and where payment transactions could be unwound if a  participant were to fail.\nThe LVTS will be particularly helpful for settling Canadian-dollar payment  obligations arising from securities transactions or foreign exchange  transactions. The real- time certainty of settlement of large-value Canadian  dollar payment messages provided by the LVTS will minimize settlement risk  associated with these types of transactions. The LVTS will also permit the  Canadian dollar to be included in cross-border multicurrency clearing and  settlement systems.\nUnder the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act (which came into force in July  1996), the Bank of Canada is responsible for the formal oversight of clearing  and settlement systems for the purpose of controlling systemic risk. The LVTS  has been designated as being subject to the Act and will be subject to ongoing  regulatory oversight by the Bank with regard to its risk-containment  arrangements.\nThe introduction of the LVTS will require changes in the way that the Bank of  Canada implements monetary policy, although it will not alter the Bank's basic  approach to policy. The key feature of the modified framework will continue to  be an operating band of 50 basis points for the overnight interest rate.  However, the limits for the band will be enforced differently.\nFor information on how the Bank intends to implement monetary policy  on a daily basis, see:\nFor additional information on the LVTS, see:"

        "text": "Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen today reviewed the economic implications  of the European currency union and its lessons for Canada. Mr. Thiessen's remarks came in a speech to the Canadian Club of Ottawa.\nCalling the launch of the euro as the new common currency of 11 European  countries \"an economic event of historic proportions,\" Mr. Thiessen described  the relatively smooth transition to the euro as \"a major political,  administrative, and technical feat.\"\nMr. Thiessen said an understanding of European monetary union had to begin  with the profound political impetus towards economic integration in the years  immediately following World War II. He noted that \"had this been a strictly  economic initiative, it might not have materialized.\"\nThe main economic benefits of the common currency are eliminating the costs  of converting currencies and removing the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.  The main cost is that countries can no longer pursue an independent monetary  policy and can \"no longer benefit from having their national currency operate as  a buffer in the event of an economic shock.\"\n\"The economic case for a common currency in Europe,\" said Governor Thiessen,  \"rests on a judgment that buffering differential shocks in the partner countries  will be a less important consideration than the benefits from lower transaction  costs and the greater economic certainty because of reduced currency risk. This  presumes that the economic structures of these countries are sufficiently alike  that any shocks will be felt by all of them at roughly the same time and to a  similar degree.\"\nTurning to the implications of the euro for Canada, the Governor said the  direct effects will be limited since Euroland accounts for just 4 per cent of  Canadian exports and 7 per cent of Canadian imports.\nHowever, the launch of the new euro has piqued public interest in Canada  about a North American monetary union. Mr. Thiessen noted the decline in the  external value of the Canadian dollar over the past year \"has, no doubt,  heightened interest in the issue.\"\nMr. Thiessen underlined that, for several reasons, \"the euro is not a  blueprint for a North American monetary union.\" He noted that in North America,  \"there are no parallels to the profound political forces\" underlying the move to  greater integration in Europe.\nMr. Thiessen said a monetary union in North America would not be like that in  Europe where there are three large partners and eight other medium- and  smaller-size participants. He said any North American monetary arrangement would  \"likely mean that Canada would have to adopt the U.S. currency.\"\nMr. Thiessen added that, for Canada, the major problem with a single North  American currency is that Canada would be giving up the buffer that a flexible  exchange rate offers in dealing with economic shocks that affect us differently  from the United States.\n\"An important contrast between Canada and the United States is the distinctly  different impact that fluctuations in the world prices of primary commodities  have on our two economies,\" Mr. Thiessen said. The decline in world commodity  prices over the past two years has meant that Canada is relatively less well  off.\n\"That is reality,\" said Mr. Thiessen, \"and we have to adjust to it, whether  we are on a floating or fixed exchange rate or even in a currency union.\" If the  exchange rate is not allowed to move, then \"the adjustment would have to take  place primarily through declines in prices and wages and the movement of labour  and capital. And if those did not readily occur, the adjustment would take  longer and cost more in terms of losses in output and employment.\"\nThe Governor concluded that there is a tendency in Canada to blame movements  in the Canadian dollar that reflect economic shocks as \"the cause of our  problems. In fact, these currency movements are a consequence, not a cause.  Exchange rate flexibility has served us well over time. Why would we want to  give it up?\""

Design of the  operational framework is based on extensive consultations with market  participants. The pilot program will run through the remainder of the 1998-99  fiscal year.\nBond buyback operations will be conducted through purchases on behalf of the  government by the Bank of Canada, in the period up to seven days following  selected bond auctions. Planned buyback transactions will be announced at the  same time as bond auction sizes are announced. Specific bonds targeted for  repurchase will be identified, and will be within a range of maturities close to  the auction maturity. The maximum size for the operation will also be  announced.\nThe Bank of Canada will accept offers to sell the listed bonds up to 12:30  p.m. on the day of operation. Government Securities Distributors (GSD) are  eligible to participate in the buyback program. To minimize turnaround time for  processing offers, a maximum of three offers per targeted bond will be accepted  from each GSD.\nFor the pilot program, the following bonds will not be eligible for  repurchase: the current benchmark bond, and the two preceding benchmark bonds at  each maturity as well as bonds in the CGB and CGF futures deliverable baskets.  Buyback transactions will be settled on a cash basis, with settlement based on  market convention. The repurchased bonds will subsequently be cancelled.\nEvery effort will be made to announce the results of the buyback operation no  later than one hour after the bidding period ends. The results will include the  amount of each bond bought back, the new outstanding amount for the repurchased  bonds and the cut-off yield for each repurchased bond."

This system will be used for tendering and processing Government  of Canada treasury bill, bond, and Receiver General Term Deposit auctions.\nCopies of the revised rules, the terms of participation, and applications for  customer bidding identification numbers are available on the Bank of Canada's  Web site, or from Bank of Canada Publications Distribution at (613) 782-8248. IDA Policy  No. 5 is also available on the Bank of Canada's Web site."

        "text": "The Bank of Canada today raised its Bank Rate by one percentage point to 6\u00a0per\u00a0cent. The Bank's operating band for the overnight rate was similarly adjusted to a range of 5\u00bd to 6\u00a0per\u00a0cent.\nToday's increase in interest rates is aimed at providing support for the Canadian dollar in order to bolster confidence, while preserving monetary conditions that will help to sustain the present non-inflationary expansion of the economy.\nFor some time now, the Canadian dollar has been under persistent downward pressure. In part, this has reflected an adjustment to increased economic uncertainty in Asia, the associated downward pressure on the prices of the primary commodities that Canada exports, and the developing problems in Russia. However, the currency decline has more recently developed a momentum that, together with the upper pressure on medium- and longer-term interest rates, signals a diminishing of confidence in Canadian dollar investments. At the same time, the depreciation of the currency has resulted in a substantial easing of monetary conditions. While some of this easing has been warranted by economic developments, it is the Bank's view that it has become excessive.\nThe crucial economic trends in Canada remain positive, supported by a low inflation environment, a declining public sector debt-to-GDP ratio and strong private sector investment. Even in the face of an uncertain international economic environment, the Canadian economy continues to expand at a solid underlying pace, spurred by consumer and investment spending in Canada and by the high level of domestic demand in the United States."

The Bank's operating band for the overnight rate was similarly adjusted to a range of 4\u00bd to 5 per cent.\nDownward pressure on the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar has intensified in recent days, leaving the dollar at levels inconsistent with the underlying trends of the Canadian economy. Although problems in Asia are likely to moderate the pace of economic activity in 1998, the outlook is still for solid expansion in output and employment that will continue to reduce the slack in the Canadian economy. In these circumstances, the extent of the significant further easing of monetary conditions due to the recent decline in the Canadian dollar is not appropriate. This adjustment in the Bank Rate is designed to rebalance monetary conditions and provide support for the Canadian dollar."

The Bank's operating band for the overnight rate was similarly adjusted.\nPersistent weakness in the Canadian dollar since late October has resulted in a further easing in monetary conditions that were already highly stimulative. Given the underlying strength in the Canadian economy and the aim of having monetary conditions that support a long-lasting expansion, this further easing is inappropriate. Currency weakness may also put at risk the sustainability of the low level of Canadian medium-and longer-term interest rates compared to those in the United States.\nThis action is designed to counter the excessive easing in monetary conditions and to provide support for the Canadian dollar."

The new Bank Rate is 3 3/4 per cent and the operating band is 3 1/4 to 3 3/4 per cent.\nIn recent months there has been growing evidence that the Canadian economy is expanding rapidly and absorbing unused capacity. Indicators of aggregate demand, output, and money supply growth have all been strong.\nThe gathering momentum now evident in the economy has occurred largely as a result of the substantial monetary support that has been provided to offset the effects associated with private and public sector restructuring.\nGiven the lags between monetary policy actions and their effect on the economy, timely action to moderate the extent of monetary stimulus will contribute to making the economic expansion long lasting. Canadian interest rates remain below those in the United States, and monetary conditions continue to support economic growth with low inflation."
