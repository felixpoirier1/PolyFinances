Canada’s infl ation-control strategy
Canada’s infl ation-control strategy1
Infl ation targeting and the economy
 The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote the

economic and fi nancial well-being of Canadians.

 Canada’s experience with infl ation targeting since 1991 has shown
that the best way to foster confi dence in the value of money and to
contribute to sustained economic growth, employment gains and
improved living standards is by keeping infl ation low, stable and
predictable.



In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed
Canada’s infl ation-control target for a further fi ve-year period, ending
December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the rate of infl ation
of the consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 percent midpoint
of the control range of 1 to 3 percent.

Monetary policy tools
 Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight

quarters—to work their way through the economy and have their
full effect on infl ation. For this reason, monetary policy must be
forward-looking.

 The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes in

the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate).2 The Bank
also has a range of other monetary policy tools it can use when the
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on
the future evolution of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases
(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures,
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these
additional tools would depend on the economic and fi nancial market
context.

 All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for

Canadian goods and services through their infl uence on market
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The
balance between this demand and the economy’s production
capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl ation
pressures in the economy.

 Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent

communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the
economy and infl ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on
eight pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s
outlook are published four times each year in the Monetary Policy
Report.

Infl ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible
 Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means
that the Bank is equally concerned about infl ation rising above or
falling below the 2 percent target.

 Canada’s infl ation-targeting framework is ﬂ exible. Typically, the

Bank seeks to return infl ation to target over a horizon of six to eight
quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning
infl ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence
of the shocks buffeting the economy.

Monitoring infl ation


In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in
indirect taxes such as the goods and services tax/harmonized sales
tax, can cause sizable fl uctuations in CPI infl ation.



In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such
transitory movements in CPI infl ation and focuses on a set of “core”
infl ation measures that better refl ect the underlying trend of infl ation.
In this sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the
Bank achieve the CPI infl ation target. They are not a replacement for
CPI infl ation.

 The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl ation are CPI-trim,
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given
month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which corresponds to
the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket
weight) of the distribution of price changes; and CPI-common, which
uses a statistical procedure to track common price changes across
categories in the CPI basket.

Overview
Overview

Canada and many countries are experiencing a setback in their economic 
recoveries. Rapid increases in the number of COVID-19 infections have 
prompted governments to impose stricter containment measures and 
lockdowns (Chart 1). However, an earlier-than-anticipated start to vaccination 
programs has pulled forward the timeline for achieving broad immunity and 
improved the outlook for growth in the medium term. Until the virus is under 
control and there is no need for physical distancing, the recuperation phase 
of the economic recovery will likely remain choppy and uneven. Considerable 
fiscal and monetary stimulus continue to be required to support households 
and businesses.

The Bank of Canada’s economic projections depend on important 
assumptions about how the pandemic will evolve. Notably, it is assumed that 
the vaccine rollout proceeds largely as announced by governments and that 
Canada, other advanced economies and China achieve broad immunity by 
the end of 2021. Emerging-market economies (EMEs) are assumed to obtain 
broad immunity by mid-2022. Uncertainty about the path of the virus and its 
effects on economic behaviour remains elevated, although less so than at 
the onset of the pandemic when the prospects for effective vaccines were 
unclear. The outlook continues to be highly conditional on the timeline for 
rolling out vaccines and on the path of the virus and its new variants.

Key messages
  The Canadian economy had strong momentum going into the last quarter 
of 2020, but the resurgence of the virus and the reintroduction of extensive 
lockdown measures are now restraining economic activity and imposing 
new hardships on households and businesses. Growth in the first quarter 
of 2021 is expected to be negative. 

  Unemployment in Canada remains elevated, particularly for workers in 
high-contact service industries. These workers will once again be the 
hardest hit by the lockdown measures.

  With vaccines being rolled out earlier than anticipated, the recuperation 
in the Canadian economy is now more secure, and medium-term growth 
is forecast to be stronger. Nevertheless, considerable economic slack 
remains in the economy, and a complete recovery will take some time. As 
a result, inflation is not anticipated to return sustainably to its 2 percent 
target until 2023.1

Global economy
Global economy

Many countries are still struggling to contain the spread of COVID-19. 
Stricter containment measures and lockdowns are weighing on the near-
term outlook, particularly in advanced economies. Policy continues to play 
an important role in helping households and businesses cope with the 
pandemic. US authorities recently passed legislation to provide additional 
fiscal stimulus to address the current economic weakness and hardship 
in their country. Accommodative monetary policy remains in place in most 
advanced economies, and several central banks—including the European 
Central Bank—have announced further easing since the October Report. 

Over the projection horizon, the early arrival of vaccines implies faster 
medium-term economic growth in advanced economies and a stronger 
outlook for global growth compared with the October Report. Global financial 
markets and commodity prices have reacted positively to the vaccines’ 
arrival and to improving prospects for global growth. The Bank projects that 
the pandemic’s direct economic effects will dissipate over 2021 and 2022 
as countries obtain broad immunity. The pandemic will, however, have more 
lasting negative effects. 

Overall, global growth is expected to average about 5 percent per 
year in 2021 and 2022 before slowing to about 4 percent in 2023 
(Table 1). The projected level of global gross domestic product (GDP) by 
the end of 2022 is about 2¼ percent higher than in the October Report.

Stronger-than-anticipated economic activity in several EMEs suggests 
their economies have been less sensitive to the pandemic than previously 
anticipated. Additional policy support and earlier-than-expected vaccines also 
imply a stronger global recovery with less lasting damage to potential GDP. 
In addition, the current projection assumes that trade-related uncertainty will 
decrease somewhat under the new US administration and with the Brexit 
agreement. 

Economic slack is expected to persist in most regions into late 2022 and 2023, 
limiting global inflationary pressures. The United States is an exception. 
US economic activity has been more resilient to the pandemic, largely due 
to less-restrictive containment measures and strong fiscal and monetary 
stimulus. As a result, the US output gap is projected to close near the end of 
2021, with inflation reaching 2 percent in late 2022. 

Financial market conditions are highly accommodative
Global equity prices have risen in response to positive vaccine 
developments, recently bringing several indexes to record highs (Chart 2). 
Sovereign bond yields continue to be very low for most advanced economies, 
consistent with accommodative monetary policies. However, nominal US 
10-year bond yields have increased about 30 basis points since the October 
Report, largely reflecting increases in expected inflation and the inflation risk 
premium. US yields have risen on an improved growth outlook, partly related 
to additional US fiscal support. 

Conditions in corporate and EME bond markets also reflect supportive 
financial conditions. Spreads have continued to narrow, and the flow of 
portfolio capital to EMEs has increased since October. The US dollar has 
continued to depreciate against many currencies amid improving global risk 
sentiment. In this context and with stronger commodity prices, the Canadian 
dollar has further appreciated by about 4 percent since October.

Vaccines and policy measures drive the US recovery
In the United States, the aggressive spread of COVID-19 and the imposition 
of additional containment measures are restraining consumption, particularly 
spending on services. Data for housing, business investment and 
international trade, however, show relatively robust recoveries. Although 
unemployment has been declining, December’s job losses indicate that the 
resurgence of the virus is affecting the labour market. The unemployment 
rate has declined and is now 6.7 percent, but the long-term unemployment 
rate has risen to 2.5 percent (Chart 3). More than 10.7 million people remain 
unemployed.

US authorities have agreed to provide additional fiscal stimulus worth 
about US$900 billion. Distribution of the funds is expected to begin in the 
first quarter of 2021, with about half the amount disbursed by mid-2021. 
US GDP is projected to grow by 5 percent in 2021, led by consumption that 
is supported by fiscal stimulus, the easing of containment measures and the 
rollout of vaccines. Strong demand and accommodative financial conditions 
are anticipated to support the recoveries in business and residential 
investment. Growth is projected to slow over 2022 and 2023 as the recovery 
progresses and the effects of fiscal stimulus fade. 

Bank staff estimate that the pandemic will have a long-term effect on the 
economy and will remove about 1¼ percent from the level of US potential 
GDP by the end of 2022. Households will likely remain somewhat cautious, 
keeping the saving rate elevated compared with historical averages. An 
increased desire for precautionary savings is expected to dampen demand 
through 2023. 

Compared with the October Report, US GDP is revised up by about 
2½ percent by the fourth quarter of 2022. This change is due to the additional 
fiscal stimulus, earlier-than-expected availability of vaccines and easier 
financial conditions. Reduced trade tensions also provide further support.

Virus resurgence halted recovery in the euro area 
Lockdowns are estimated to have led to sharply negative euro area growth 
in the fourth quarter of 2020 and are likely also to weigh on growth in early 
2021. Deteriorating economic conditions and slowing inflation prompted the 
European Central Bank to announce additional easing in December. The 
recovery is expected to pick up in mid-2021 as containment measures ease 
and vaccines are widely distributed. The resolution of uncertainty around 
Brexit negotiations also removes some drag on growth. The Bank projects 
GDP growth in the euro area of about 4½ percent in 2021 and 2022, as policy 
supports growth and the direct effects of the pandemic diminish. The early 
deployment of vaccines has considerably strengthened the medium-term 
outlook for the euro area relative to the October Report. 

China’s strong economic recovery continues 
China’s recovery continues to broaden. Consumption is strengthening, 
and the country is experiencing robust expansions in industrial production, 
exports and investment. Chinese exports will likely continue to benefit from 
resilience in global demand for goods. Growth is expected to be about 
8½ percent in 2021 and then to slow in 2022 and 2023 to be broadly in line 
with potential output growth. With the virus relatively well controlled and 
economic activity returning to normal, China is less affected than other 
regions by the early arrival of vaccines, and the Bank’s forecast for GDP 
growth is largely unchanged from the October Report. Reduced trade 
tensions and stronger foreign demand support somewhat greater growth, but 
higher oil prices and the appreciation of the Chinese currency since October 
largely offset those effects. Recently, credit conditions have also tightened 
somewhat, following some high-profile corporate bond defaults.

Recovery in emerging-market economies is strong
Recent data indicate a robust economic recovery in many EMEs, likely 
reflecting less severe impacts of the virus than had been initially feared. 
However, the rollout of vaccines is assumed to occur more slowly in most 
EMEs than in advanced economies. As a result, the direct effects from the 
pandemic are expected to take longer to dissipate. Economic activity in oil-
importing EMEs is projected to grow by 6½ percent in 2021 and to increase 
by about 5 percent on average in 2022 and 2023, as direct effects from 
the pandemic ease and foreign demand strengthens. The outlook for oil-
importing EMEs is revised up considerably from the October Report. This 
upward revision is based mostly on stronger-than-expected recent data—
particularly for India and emerging Europe—as well as on easier financial 
conditions. 

In the rest-of-world group, several countries have reimposed containment 
measures. This is anticipated to restrain activity in the near term. Growth 
is forecast to be 2 percent in 2021 and to pick up to 4 percent in 2022, as 
vaccines reduce the need for physical distancing. Oil prices remain below 
their pre-pandemic levels, weighing on the outlook for oil exporters, which 
make up most of this group. However, recent increases in oil prices and 
reduced uncertainty following the Brexit agreement contribute to upward 
revisions to growth relative to the October Report.

Commodity prices have risen 
Prices of Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil have averaged about 
US$50 per barrel recently, roughly US$10 higher than assumed in the 
October Report (Chart 4). The price of Western Canadian Select (WCS) 
has increased about US$5 to average US$35 per barrel (Box 1, page 12). 
Canadian oil output has continued to recover, and the spread between prices 
for WTI and WCS has widened modestly since October.

The recent rise in global oil prices reflects stronger global growth prospects, 
including the arrival of vaccines, which could boost demand for oil-intensive 
activities, such as travel. Changes in supply also explain some of the recent 
price increase. Saudi Arabia announced that it will cut its oil production 
in February and March 2021. Other members of the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC oil producers 
agreed to maintain production close to January levels. Major forecasters 
expect both limited investment and profitability pressures to constrain 
US shale oil production over the medium term. Despite recent increases, 
global oil prices remain more than 10 percent below their pre-pandemic 
levels.

The Bank’s non-energy commodity price index has climbed steeply since the 
October Report, with base metals, agriculture and forestry all rising (Chart 4). 
Robust demand from China and improving growth prospects in other regions 
have increased all major base metal prices since October, including a rise 
of more than 15 percent in copper prices. With more Chinese feed imports 
and poor crops in some regions, canola and corn prices have driven the 
agriculture index up. Prices of forestry products have risen since October 
amid ongoing strong demand from the North American housing sector.

A resurgence of COVID-19 cases and tightening containment measures 
are interrupting growth and imposing renewed hardship on households and 
businesses (Chart 5). Economic activity is expected to decline in the first 
quarter. However, consumers and firms have been learning how to conduct 
business while complying with restrictions and public health guidelines. As 
a result, the pattern of decline and rebound is anticipated to be less severe 
than it was during the initial outbreak in 2020. The earlier-than-expected 
arrival of vaccines also contributes to a forecast for stronger growth later in 
2021.

The impact of the pandemic continues to be uneven across industries 
(Chart 6). The burden of the recent lockdowns is expected to be carried once 
again by workers and businesses in high-contact services industries. This 
will exacerbate the pandemic’s uneven effects on workers. The closing of 
in-person schooling in some provinces poses renewed challenges to many 
working parents, particularly women.

Over the medium term, consumption is expected to gain momentum as more 
Canadians are vaccinated and employment rises. Progress toward broad 
immunity both globally and in Canada will support business investment and 
exports, as pandemic-related uncertainty declines and business confidence 
improves. Fiscal and monetary stimulus is helping to offset the impacts of the 
pandemic (Box 2, page 22). With recent federal announcements, fiscal policy 
is expected to support growth into 2023.

After declining by 5½ percent in 2020, economic activity is expected to grow 
by about 4 percent in 2021 and almost 5 percent in 2022 (Table 2). In 2023, 
the economy is projected to grow at around 2½ percent. The medium-term 
outlook is stronger than in the October Report because of the positive effects 
from vaccines, greater fiscal stimulus, stronger foreign demand and higher 
commodity prices. Meanwhile, potential output has also been revised up, 
reflecting an improved projection for business investment and less scarring 
effects on businesses and workers.

There is considerable uncertainty around the medium-term outlook for GDP 
and the path for potential output. Thus, while the output gap is expected to 
close in 2023, the timing is particularly uncertain.

Consumer price index (CPI) inflation has risen from its 2020 lows. CPI 
inflation is anticipated to continue to increase in the near term mainly due 
to gasoline price dynamics. Economic slack is forecast to put downward 
pressure on inflation throughout 2021 and 2022.

A wave of new infections weighs on activity
Economic activity is estimated to have expanded almost 5 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, however, GDP is forecast 
to decline by about 2½ percent. The course of the virus is leading to choppy 
quarterly growth rates—momentum was strong during the early part of the 
fourth quarter of 2020 before slowing as the virus spread and governments 
tightened restrictions (Table 3). Over the coming months, as the current 
wave of the virus recedes and restrictions are once again eased, activity is 
expected to rebound strongly.

As a result of recent lockdowns, consumption is anticipated to decrease 
in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. This near-term 
weakness in overall consumption is being driven by declines in purchases 
of non-essential goods and hard-to-distance services. However, more 
consumers are shopping online, as seen in the Bank’s Canadian Survey 
of Consumer Expectations, which should help to limit the drag on goods 
consumption compared with last spring.

Box 1

Key inputs to the projection
Th  e Bank of Canada’s projection is always conditional on 
several key assumptions, and changes to them will aﬀ ect 
the outlook for the Canadian economy. Th  e Bank regularly 
reviews these assumptions and assesses the sensitivity of 
the economic projection to them. Th  e key inputs into the 
Bank’s projection are as follows:
  An eﬀ ective vaccine rollout leads to broad immunity 

by the end of 2021 in Canada, other advanced 
economies and China and by mid-2022 in other 
emerging-market economies.

  In Canada, several provinces have either tightened or 
extended containment measures. Th  e Bank’s outlook 
assumes that the most severe of these measures 
will be eased in February. Reduced restrictions are 
assumed to remain in place thereaft er, gradually 
easing as the pandemic recedes. Th  e duration and 
intensity of restrictions depend on the path of the 
virus.

  Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent levels. 
Th  e per-barrel prices in US dollars are assumed to be 
$50 for Brent and West Texas Intermediate and $35 
for Western Canadian Select, about $10 and $5 higher, 
respectively, than assumed in the October Report.

  By convention, the Bank does not forecast the 

exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. Th  e 
Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at 78 cents US 
over the projection horizon, close to its recent average 
and above the 76 cents US assumed in the October 
Report.

  Th  e pandemic and related containment measures 
have persistent and temporary negative eﬀ ects on 
the Canadian economy.1
  Th  e Bank’s assessment of the growth of potential 
output, a longer-term concept, looks through the 
short-lived impacts of containment measures. Th  e 
Bank estimates that persistent scarring eﬀ ects 
of the pandemic on the labour force, investment 

1  As in the October Report, the Bank makes the distinction between supply and 

potential output in the near term to account for the relatively short-lived nature 
of some of the decrease in supply.

and productivity will weigh on potential output 
growth (for details, see Appendix 1 of the October 
Report). Over 2021–23, potential output growth is 
assumed to average about 1.4 percent per year in 
the projection.2

  Containment measures implemented by 

governments are having important short-term 
eﬀ ects on the supply of goods and services. In 
particular, supply fell sharply in 2020 when some 
businesses were forced to temporarily suspend 
or reduce operations. Th  e eﬀ ects of containment 
measures on supply are expected to remain 
signifi cant in early 2021 and to dissipate by the 
end of the year.

  Estimates of supply can be obtained by combining 

the estimates of the temporary eﬀ ects of the 
containment measures with the assessment of 
potential output. Th  e Bank estimates that the 
output gap—the diﬀ erence between GDP and 
supply—was about -3.75 to -2.75 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 2020, somewhat narrower than 
the revised range of -4.5 to -3.5 percent in the 
third quarter.3

  Th  e neutral nominal policy rate is defi ned as the real 
rate consistent with output remaining sustainably at 
its potential and with inﬂ ation at target, on an ongoing 
basis, plus 2 percent for inﬂ ation. It is a medium- to 
long-term equilibrium concept. For Canada, the 
economic projection is based on an assumption that 
the neutral rate is at the midpoint of the estimated 
range of 1.75 to 2.75 percent. Th  is range was last 
reassessed in the October Report. 

2  Th  e assumptions regarding potential output and potential output growth are 

3 

higher than in the October Report. Th  is change reﬂ ects positive historical 
revisions, stronger expected investment, higher immigration targets and 
reduced scarring eﬀ ects from the pandemic. 
In the October Report, the output gap in the third quarter of 2020 was assumed 
to be between -4 and -3 percent. Historical data revisions and new data 
published since the October Report have reduced the level of GDP and raised 
estimates of the level of potential output for that quarter. As a result, the output 
gap in the third quarter of 2020 is estimated to be roughly 0.5 percentage 
points more negative than assumed in October.

Demand for housing has continued to show resilience, despite increasing 
case numbers and tightening restrictions. The level of housing activity should 
remain elevated into the start of 2021, supported by low borrowing rates and 
resilient disposable incomes. Changes in homebuyers’ preferences have also 
played a role. For example, price growth has been strongest for single-family 
homes and in areas outside city centres (Chart 7).
Business investment and exports are anticipated to expand in the fourth 
quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, supported by domestic and 
global demand for goods. Business financing conditions have also remained 
favourable—a sharp contrast compared with the 2008–09 global financial 
crisis (Chart 8). In the first quarter of 2021, exports should also benefit from 
higher commodity prices.

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONetARy POlICy RePORt  •  JANUARy 2021

The estimate of growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 has been revised up 
significantly, by almost 4 percentage points. Momentum entering the quarter 
was stronger than expected in the October Report, and this additional 
strength continued well into the quarter. Meanwhile, containment measures 
have been tightened by more than was anticipated, leading to additional 
weakness in the first quarter of this year. If restrictions are reduced later in 
the first quarter, a sharp bounce-back is expected in the second quarter.

Significant excess capacity remains 
Weaker growth at the end of 2020 and in early 2021 will exacerbate an 
already-difficult labour market for many Canadian workers. Pandemic-related 
job losses were around 640,000 in December, substantially worse than at 
the peak of the 2008–09 recession. The unemployment rate declined from 
13.7 percent at its peak in May 2020 to 8.6 percent in December. Meanwhile, 
after rising sharply in recent months, the long-term unemployment rate 
reached 2.4 percent in December, up about 1.5 percentage points from May 
(Chart 9). The large number of long-term unemployed workers is a serious 
concern because their skills may erode and their attachment to the labour 
force may decrease.

Vulnerable workers are expected to be the most adversely affected by recent 
restrictions. In December, employment of low-wage workers was only about 
80 percent of its pre-pandemic level (Chart 10). Youth, women and low-
wage employees are more likely to work in severely affected sectors, such as 
accommodation and food services. A further challenge is that unemployed 
workers from these sectors typically move among jobs that are also currently 
at risk. For example, from 2010 to 2019, almost 70 percent of laid-off workers 
in accommodation and food services who found work within a year moved to 
a different job within the same industry.

Nevertheless, some labour market developments have been positive. Despite 
the ongoing challenges in some sectors, overall job gains were unexpectedly 
resilient to rising numbers of COVID-19 cases in October and November.

This may reflect adaptations such as remote work. As well, support from the 
Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy helps employees and employers maintain 
their connections. Despite sizable declines in part-time positions, full-time 
job gains continued into December, reflecting underlying momentum in some 
sectors of the economy.

Indicators of capacity and labour pressures rose in the winter Business 
Outlook Survey and were concentrated in the goods sector. About one-
quarter of goods-producing firms reported supply chain frictions related to the 
pandemic. Most of these businesses also expect pressures on input prices 
to increase over the coming year. In contrast, most services sector firms 
reported that pressures remain low. More broadly, among firms that plan to 
grow their workforce over the next year, about one-half do not expect to ramp 
up hiring until after the pandemic has subsided.

Despite the strong rebound in the third quarter and upward revisions to 
growth in the fourth quarter, considerable slack remains in the Canadian 
economy. The Bank estimates that the output gap narrowed to between 
-3.75 and -2.75 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020. This degree of excess
capacity is close to that at the worst of the 2008–09 recession.

CPI inflation is near the low end of the target range
CPI inflation remains well below target. Prices for some components that 
fell sharply because of weak demand early in the pandemic have continued 
to hold down inflation. Examples include prices of gasoline and hotel 
accommodation as well as airfare. Inflation calculated using an adjusted 
price index that accounts for the significant shifts in consumption patterns 
during the pandemic follows a similar pattern to CPI inflation and also shows 
weakness. However, it has been about 0.4 percentage points higher than CPI 
inflation in recent months (Chart 11).

Last observation: November 2020

Measures of core inflation have remained below 2 percent. They have been 
higher than CPI inflation because the core measures are less influenced by 
large price declines in a small number of components, such as gasoline and 
travel-related services.

CPI inflation has been stronger than expected in recent months. While the 
unanticipated strength was relatively broad-based, it was driven partly by 
stronger consumer demand for some goods. As well, increased input costs 
related to the pandemic may be playing a role. For example, shelter costs 
were higher than anticipated, partly reflecting higher-than-expected prices 
of new homes due to higher prices for building materials. These factors will 
likely persist in the coming months and are contributing to a stronger near-
term outlook for inflation. In addition, by March, gasoline prices will be well 
above their lows of a year earlier, even if they do not change from their 
current level. This will significantly boost inflation.

Strong growth and a protracted recuperation are 
expected
Growth is expected to be around 4 percent in 2021 and close to 5 percent 
in 2022, as the economy recovers from the significant economic impacts 
of the pandemic (Chart 12). The Bank anticipates that quarterly growth 
rates will continue to be choppy. This is because suppressed spending from 
containment restrictions in one quarter is likely to be followed by a bounce in 
another quarter after measures are eased. The choppiness should diminish 
over time as the share of the immunized population increases and economic 
momentum becomes more sustained. By 2023, growth is anticipated to 
moderate to around 2½ percent.

Several factors contribute to a stronger medium-term outlook than in the 
October Report. Vaccinations have begun sooner than expected, shortening 
the Bank’s assumed timeline for broad immunity by roughly six months, to the 
end of 2021. As a result, economic activity comes back more quickly and the 
projection includes less scarring for businesses (e.g., fewer bankruptcies) and 
for workers (e.g., less erosion of skills). Fiscal stimulus, foreign demand and 
commodity prices are also anticipated to be stronger.

Fiscal policy is expected to continue to support the recovery. Federal and 
provincial measures introduced since early 2020—including direct spending, 
transfers and credit measures—amount to around 25 percent of nominal GDP 
from the fourth quarter of 2019. Additional stimulus of between $70 billion and 
$100 billion over three years was announced in the federal Fall Economic 
Statement in 2020. While details have yet to be released, the government 
indicated that the level of stimulus will support growth once the pandemic has 
ended, with the amount of stimulus dependent on the strength of the recovery.

The pandemic will likely have lasting effects on potential output, but these 
cannot be estimated with precision. How long changes in consumer and 
business behaviour may last also remains unclear. These factors contribute 
to uncertainty in estimates of the output gap.

Consumption is forecast to underpin the recovery
In the Bank’s projection, several factors influence consumption. These 
include the easing of containment measures and the recovery of consumer 
confidence, as well as elevated levels of disposable income. Over the 
projection horizon, recovery of the labour market contributes to higher 
labour income, while government payments to households gradually decline. 
Monetary policy is expected to continue to support spending, particularly for 
durable goods (such as motor vehicles) and housing.

With consumption still well below its pre-pandemic level, the drag from 
physical distancing should fade, which should contribute to strong growth of 
around 4¼ percent on average in 2021 and 2022. An important driver of this 
growth is the anticipated rebound in consumer spending on services, such as 
hospitality and travel.

The Bank assumes that households do not boost their consumption spending 
using the savings that many have accumulated since the start of the 
pandemic. The savings rate is anticipated to decline but remain somewhat 
higher than its pre-pandemic level (Chart 13). This assumption is consistent 
with lasting effects on consumer behaviour, such as heightened demand 
for precautionary savings. For example, nearly half of respondents to the 
Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations in the fourth quarter of 2020 
reported that they plan to keep most of their extra savings as a safeguard. 
However, this cautiousness may not persist, leading to an upside risk to the 
consumption outlook.

Housing market activity is expected to soften gradually from current elevated 
levels. In 2021, demand for single-family homes will likely continue to outpace 
supply, supported by low financing costs and an improving labour market. 
After 2021, the impact on demand from shifts in housing-related preferences 
is expected to fade. Activity should slow toward levels consistent with the rate 
of new household formation. As activity eases, price growth should soften.

Foreign demand should drive export recovery
The global recovery is anticipated to support exports over 2021 and 2022. 
Goods exports should benefit from strengthening foreign demand, reduced 
pandemic-related uncertainty and improving global investment (Chart 14). 
However, the assumed higher level of the Canadian dollar will act as a 
headwind. Services exports are expected to rebound strongly from weak 
levels, as travel restrictions are lifted, and then to moderate later in the

projection horizon. However, the rebound in some services, such as business 
travel, may be less than complete if preferences shift or positive experiences 
with technology change behaviour.

Moderate oil prices are expected to support ongoing growth in energy 
exports. While it is unlikely that pipeline capacity will constrain exports in the 
near term, transportation concerns could resurface as an impediment to oil 
exports over the medium term.

Import growth over the projection horizon will depend on the timing of the 
recovery in demand for goods and services. The growth in imports picks up 
strongly in 2021, reflecting the rapid recovery in demand for retail goods, 
a large share of which are imported. By 2022, import growth softens as 
consumption growth is boosted by the rebound in services, which are mainly 
provided domestically. The higher level of the Canadian dollar will also 
increase competition from imports.

Business investment strengthens as uncertainty 
recedes
Outside the oil and gas sector, investment is expected to pick up significantly 
in 2021 from current low levels. Less uncertainty should allow firms to move 
ahead with their investment plans. The winter Business Outlook Survey 
revealed that firms are becoming more positive about the future (Chart 15). 
About one-fifth of firms reported that they are starting or speeding up 
investments in digitalization and automation in response to the pandemic. 
The accelerated trend toward e-commerce could also have lasting 
implications for the Canadian economy. For example, it should support strong 
investment in machinery and equipment and warehouses but could weigh on 
the construction of retail space.

The recovery in business investment is likely to be uneven. In the winter 
Business Outlook Survey, about one-third of businesses, mostly those 
that provide high-contact services, do not anticipate sales to return to their

pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021. In addition, the recovery in oil and 
gas investment is expected to be lengthy, given the uncertainty regarding the 
recovery of oil demand over the medium term, difficult financing conditions 
and increasing restrictions on carbon emissions.

Inventory investment should turn positive in mid-2021 as firms rebuild their 
low retail inventories. However, the positive impact on GDP is expected to be 
relatively modest given the high share of imported retail goods.

Inflation returns sustainably to 2 percent in 2023
In the projection, the path for CPI inflation over the next year largely reflects 
dynamics of energy prices (Chart 16). After holding inflation down for a year, 
gasoline prices will temporarily boost inflation, pushing it to about 2 percent 
in the second quarter. As these upward pressures dissipate over 2021, the 
projection for inflation falls back to the lower half of the target range. The 
Bank tends to look through such temporary movements in inflation.

The ongoing drag from economic slack is the most important driver of 
inflation dynamics over the medium term. Although the timing is highly 
uncertain, inflation is expected to return sustainably to the 2 percent target 
as excess capacity is absorbed. In the base-case projection, this occurs in 
2023.

The risks to the inflation outlook reflect the high degree of uncertainty 
surrounding the evolution of the pandemic and its impacts on the economy. 
For example, capacity pressures in industries with strong demand or higher 
operating costs from implementing physical distancing measures could be a 
source of more persistent upward price pressure.

and crude oil prices.

The projection is consistent with medium- and long-term inflation expectations 
remaining well anchored at the 2 percent target. Most firms that participated in 
the winter Business Outlook Survey expect that inflation will remain within the 
Bank’s inflation-control target range of 1 to 3 percent over the next two years. 
Respondents’ expectations for inflation two years from now remain close to 
pre-pandemic levels. As in recent years, in the fourth quarter of 2020 most 
respondents to the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations anticipate 
that inflation will be within or just above that range over the next two years. 
The December 2020 Consensus Economics forecast for long-term inflation 
expectations shows an average of 2.0 percent through 2030.

Chart 2-A:

Weighted average maturity and notional QE purchases, weekly average
together to keep borrowing rates low. As described in the 
July Monetary Policy Report, this helps support economic 
activity. In October, the Bank recalibrated its QE program 
to slow the pace of its bond purchases but maintained 
the amount of stimulus by increasing the maturity of its 
purchases.
Th  e weighted average maturity (WAM) of QE purchases 
made since the October Report is more than 7 years.1 Th  e 
WAM was around 6 years for purchases made between 
the July and October reports (Chart 2-A) and around 
5 years for purchases made between the April and July 
reports. Coupled with the maturing of shorter-term assets, 
the recalibrated QE program has resulted in a somewhat 
longer overall maturity structure of the Bank’s balance 
sheet. Th  e total balance sheet now has 18 percent of 
assets maturing in 10 years or more, compared with 
15 percent at the time of the October Report.
Government of Canada (GoC) bonds now make up 
55 percent of the assets on the Bank’s balance sheet. 
At the same time, the Bank’s ownership of the total 
amount of these bonds outstanding has increased 
from 32 percent in October to 36 percent.2 Th  is share 
includes Bank purchases at auctions that are part of the 
Bank’s standard practice as well as QE purchases. As a 
percentage of gross domestic product, the government 
bond holdings of some central banks are smaller than 
those of the Bank of Canada, while, for others, holdings 
are larger (Chart 2-B).
Th  e balance sheet has grown from $530 billion in October 
to $548 billion. Th  is increase has occurred because the 
purchases of GoC bonds have outpaced the maturing 
of other assets associated with operations to support 
market functioning. Th  e pace at which these other assets 
are maturing will accelerate over the next three months. 
More than $140 billion of treasury bills and enhanced 

term repos will mature during this period, and the Bank’s 
balance sheet will likely decrease as a result. However, 
the size of the Bank’s balance sheet on its own is not an 
appropriate indicator of the total amount of monetary 
stimulus being provided. Rather, the degree of exceptional 
monetary stimulus is linked to QE operations. 
In assessing the degree of exceptional monetary 
stimulus, it is important to consider the ﬂ ow of GoC bond 
purchases, the maturity of those purchases and the 
total stock of the purchases. Th  e ﬂ ow of purchases puts 
ongoing downward pressure on yields, which reduces 
borrowing costs for households and businesses. Th  e 
maturity of purchases matters because when they are 
tilted toward longer-maturity securities, more term risk is 
removed from markets. Th  e stock of purchases provides 
an indication of the total amount of exceptional stimulus. 
In the coming months, the Bank’s holdings of GoC bonds 
will continue to increase, further supporting the recovery.

RISKS tO the INFlAtION OUtlOOK   25 

Risks to the inflation outlook 
Risks to the inflation outlook 

Uncertainty around the projection remains unusually high. Several risks 
identified in previous reports have materialized: vaccines arrived earlier 
than expected, authorities reimposed strict containment measures, and 
governments announced additional fiscal policy support. Some previously 
identified risks have receded—fiscal policy has helped to reduce household 
financial vulnerabilities, and financial conditions have eased in many 
countries, notably in EMEs.

The projection still depends importantly on how the pandemic and 
vaccination efforts evolve. The Bank assumes that broad immunity is 
obtained through vaccination by the end of 2021. There is a risk, however, 
that setbacks in the distribution or effectiveness of vaccines could contribute 
to another surge of the virus. The spread of new, more contagious variants 
could also lead governments to impose stricter lockdowns.

Another key source of uncertainty is the sensitivity of economic activity to the 
evolution of the virus, lockdowns and other containment measures. The outlook 
could be stronger than in the base-case projection if containment measures 
result in less drag on economic growth than assumed. This would imply 
stronger household spending and business investment. Similarly, the outlook 
could be weaker than projected if households become more cautious or if more 
businesses are pushed into bankruptcy. 

There is also considerable uncertainty about the long-term impacts of the 
pandemic. GDP and potential output could be stronger than in the base 
case if scarring effects are more limited than assumed. In contrast, potential 
GDP growth could be more negatively affected if the pandemic is longer or 
harsher than assumed, likely leading to more restructuring and reallocation of 
resources.

The pandemic may also accelerate long-term structural trends that have been 
underway for some time. Rapid acceleration in e-commerce may lead to less 
demand for retail space. Success with remote work could lead to reduced 
demand for office space. Experience with virtual meetings may imply less 
business travel. These types of structural changes tend to affect both 
demand and supply, with demand effects usually having an impact sooner.

Even if the course of the pandemic proceeds as assumed in the base-case 
projection, the Bank sees a number of other upside and downside risks to the 
outlook for inflation. The forecast risks to the economic outlook and inflation

are viewed as roughly balanced. Downside risks pose a greater concern 
because inflation is currently low and the policy rate is at its estimated 
effective lower bound. Key risks include the following.

(i)  Stronger household spending in Canada (↑)

Household savings have increased dramatically since the pandemic 
began, particularly for higher-income households. This likely reflects 
fewer opportunities to spend and increased precautionary savings. 
If households spend their accumulated savings, rather than using 
them to pay down debt or invest in financial assets, then consumption 
and residential investment could be stronger than in the base-case 
projection. This would imply less disinflationary pressure.  

(ii)  Additional fiscal stimulus in the United States (↑)

The new US administration has proposed additional fiscal stimulus 
over the $900 billion approved since the October Report. If authorities 
reach an agreement to enact substantial additional fiscal support, US 
growth could be materially stronger than in the base-case projection. 
This would further support Canadian export growth, the prices of our 
commodity exports and investment activity. 

(iii) Persistent cost pressures (↑)

The pandemic is disrupting business operations across all sectors of 
the economy. For example, to avoid similar supply-chain difficulties in 
the future, many manufacturing firms will likely change their production 
processes, including re-sourcing their inputs or production and 
increasing their resiliency. Thus, the economic recovery could take 
place against a backdrop of structural changes to global value chains 
and production process, resulting in more persistent cost pressures. 

(iv) Corporate financial stress (↓)

In sectors hard hit by COVID-19, the longer the pandemic lasts, the 
greater the number of businesses that may face cash flow pressures. 
This increases the risks of a sudden wave of insolvencies and 
bankruptcies, a sharp tightening in credit conditions and a reduction 
in bank lending, with negative implications for growth. Meanwhile, 
in sectors that are less affected by the pandemic, businesses have 
increased their cash buffers. These businesses may be more 
conservative in their investment decisions because of lingering 
uncertainty, potential structural changes and the perception that 
disruptive events have become more likely.

(v)  Stronger Canadian dollar (↓)

The Canadian dollar has risen steadily since October, reaching its highest 
level since early 2018. This increase has been driven primarily by broad-
based weakness of the US dollar. Appreciation of the Canadian dollar 
creates direct downward pressure on inflation by lowering the prices of 
imports. Further appreciation of the Canadian dollar could slow output 
growth by reducing the competitiveness of Canadian exports and import-
competing production. Slower output growth would also imply more 
disinflationary pressures.

REPORT
October 2016

Canada’s Inﬂ ation-Control Strategy1

Infl ation targeting and the economy
•  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to pro-
mote the economic and fi nancial well-being of Canadians . 

•  Canada’s experience with infl ation targeting since 1991 
has shown that the best way to foster confi dence in the 
value of money and to contribute to sustained economic 
growth, employment gains and improved living standards 
is by keeping infl ation low, stable and predictable . 
In 2011, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 
Canada’s infl ation-control target for a further fi ve-year 
period, ending 31 December 2016 . The target, as measured 
by the total consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 
2 per cent midpoint of the control range of 1 to 3 per cent .

• 

The monetary policy instrument
•  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes 
in the target overnight rate of interest .2 These changes 
are transmitted to the economy through their infl uence 
on market interest rates, domestic asset prices and the 
exchange rate, which aﬀ ect total demand for Canadian 
goods and services . The balance between this demand 
and the economy’s production capacity is, over time, the 
primary determinant of infl ation pressures in the economy . 

•  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to 
eight quarters—to work their way through the economy 
and have their full eﬀ ect on infl ation . For this reason, 
monetary policy must be forward-looking . 

•  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent 

communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspec-
tive on the forces at work on the economy and their 

implications for infl ation . The Monetary Policy Report is a 
key element of this approach . Policy decisions are typi-
cally announced on eight pre-set days during the year, 
and full updates of the Bank’s outlook, including risks to 
the projection, are published four times per year in the 
Monetary Policy Report .

Infl ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible
•  Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which 
means that the Bank is equally concerned about infl ation 
rising above or falling below the 2 per cent target . 
•  Canada’s infl ation-targeting framework is ﬂ exible . 

Typically, the Bank seeks to return infl ation to target over 
a horizon of six to eight quarters . However, the most 
appropriate horizon for returning infl ation to target will 
vary depending on the nature and persistence of the 
shocks buﬀ eting the economy .

Monitoring infl ation
• 

In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is 
caused by fl uctuations in the prices of certain volatile 
components (e .g ., fruit and gasoline) and by changes in 
indirect taxes . For this reason, the Bank also monitors a 
set of “core” infl ation measures, for example, the CPIX, 
which strips out eight of the most volatile CPI compo-
nents and the eﬀ ect of indirect taxes on the remaining 
components . These “core” measures allow the Bank to 
“look through” temporary price movements and focus on 
the underlying trend of infl ation . In this sense, core infl a-
tion is monitored as an operational guide to help the Bank 
achieve the total CPI infl ation target . It is not a replace-
ment for it .

1  See Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inﬂ ation-Control Target (8 November 2011) and

Renewal of the Inﬂ ation-Control Target: Background Information—November 2011, which are both available on the Bank’s website .

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide 

 additional monetary stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions . The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates,  available 
on the Bank’s website, describes these measures and the principles guiding their use .

Global Economy

The global economy is regaining momentum. The downward revision to 
global growth in 2016 is mostly due to weaker-than-expected activity in the 
United States in the first half of the year. Looking ahead, solid domestic fun-
damentals should support a rebound in growth in US real gross domestic 
product (GDP). Globally, economic growth is projected to pick up from 
about 2 3/4 per cent in 2016 to about 3 1/2 per cent by 2018. Emerging-
market economies (EMEs) are expected to drive this strengthening as reces-
sions in certain countries run their course and progress is made on reforms 
to support growth (Table 1).

Weak business investment and trade remain dominant themes in the global 
economic outlook (Box 1). Global growth in investment has slowed since 
2012, partly as a result of uncertainty over future prospects for global 
demand and ongoing structural adjustments in China.

Box 1

The Weakness in Global Trade 
Global trade has decelerated signifi cantly in the past six 
years (Chart 1-A) . For the previous 20-plus years, global 
trade growth had been increasing at about twice the pace 
of that of GDP . This fast pace of growth was the result of 
a major structural shift, driven mainly by trade liberaliz-
ation, including the entry of China into the World Trade 
Organization (WTO), and technological advances that per-
mitted an unprecedented deepening of global value chains .1

reverse since . Economic advances had been driving an 
expansion of trade, notably in emerging Asia, but their 
nature has changed and they are now leading to move-
ments up the value chain and a substitution of domestic for 
imported inputs . In particular, over the past decade, China’s 
manufacturing industry has been producing a widening 
range of products domestically, thus specializing less in 
assembling and processing imported inputs and reducing 
the importance of global supply chains . 
In the post-crisis period, a shift toward greater protec-
tionism also appears to have weighed on global trade 
growth . While the G20 leaders have consistently pledged 
to avoid protectionist measures since 2009, that resolve 
has weakened over time . According to the WTO, G20 
economies have imposed a total of 1,583 trade-restrictive 
measures since 2009, with 145 new measures during the six 
months from October 2015 to mid-May 2016 alone .
The weak global economy has also been a major factor in 
reducing the growth of global trade . A particularly important 
contributor has been the sluggishness of investment, which 
in turn refl ects a combination of structural and cyclical 
factors .2 The slowdown in global investment growth—a 
trade-intensive component of demand—has been occurring 
since 2012, especially in recent quarters . Growth in private 
investment remains subdued across many advanced econ-
omies, particularly the United States . While investment 
growth should recover as demand prospects improve, it will 
probably be on a weaker trajectory than before the crisis .
The interconnected weakness in both trade and investment 
is likely an important factor in the persistent slowdown in 
productivity and potential output growth since the global 
fi nancial crisis .

2  The International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook (October 2016), 

Chapter 2, notes that the overall weakness in global economic activity, particularly 
in investment, has been the primary restraint on trade growth, accounting for up 
to three-quarters of the slowdown . 

Global financial conditions remain accommodative
Global financial conditions have remained broadly accommodative since the 
July Report, reflecting, in part, monetary policies. In an environment of still-
low inflation and lacklustre growth, central banks in advanced economies 
have maintained or further eased their policy stances.

Yields in most advanced economies remain near record lows, despite an 
increase in long-term government bond yields in recent weeks. These low 
yields have been contributing to strong portfolio inflows and easier financing 
conditions in many EMEs. Meanwhile, global equity prices remain near 
recent highs. Corporate spreads have continued to decline since the July 
Report, and the issuance of global corporate debt has been strong.

Markets expect a very drawn-out normalization process for the policy 
interest rate in the United States. This normalization will contribute to mon-
etary policy divergence among advanced economies. As it proceeds over 
the projection horizon, this normalization is likely to contribute to a steep-
ening of yield curves in global markets.

US economic growth is expected to rebound
The US economy is expected to strengthen in the second half of 2016, after 
growing more slowly than potential in the first half. After five successive quar-
ters of being a drag on growth, inventory investment is expected to contribute 
positively in the second half (Chart 1). In addition, business investment should 
regain momentum. Specifically, a rising oil rig count suggests an improvement 
in energy investment. Residential investment also contracted in the second 
quarter as the composition of housing construction shifted toward smaller 
homes. It is expected to resume growing, in line with demographic demand 
for housing. Meanwhile, consumption growth has been strong, underpinned 
by robust consumer confidence and a strong labour market, with ongoing 
robust job gains over the past several years (Chart 2).

Economic growth is expected to pick up to about 2 per cent on average 
over 2017–18, as forecast in the July Report. However, the expected com-
position of growth has shifted. Business investment is projected to expand 
at a more moderate pace than previously forecast, and the profile for 
residential investment is expected to be lower. Offsetting these revisions is 
a slightly faster pace of consumption growth. Business investment is now 
projected to grow about 3 per cent per year over 2017–18, in line with the 
anticipated recovery in aggregate demand (Box 2). Growth in exports should 
also pick up as the drag associated with the past appreciation of the US 
dollar continues to dissipate.

Core PCE (personal consumption expenditure) inflation has risen from its 
recent trough of 1.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015 and is projected 
to reach 2 per cent by 2018, as wage pressures rise and the disinflationary 
effects of the past exchange rate appreciation ease.

Box 2

Understanding Weak US Business Investment
US business investment has been a drag on growth, having 
contracted by an average of 2 per cent over the past three 
quarters . Some of this drag was anticipated, given the sharp 
downturn in energy sector investment, which in turn reduced 
investment by industrial suppliers, such as oil-fi eld equipment 
producers and their upstream suppliers . More unexpected was 
the softness seen outside of the energy sector (Chart 2-A) . 
This broader weakness likely refl ects a combination of both 
temporary factors and longer-term trends . 
Transitory factors include the past appreciation of the US dollar, 
which has curbed exporters’ investment plans, and economic 
and political uncertainty, which may have led businesses 
to delay key investment decisions .1 In coming months, the 
eﬀ ects of these temporary headwinds should diminish and 
energy investment is expected to stabilize . As a result, invest-
ment growth is anticipated to rebound in 2017 . 
longer-term trends will, however, moderate the pickup in 
investment growth . After cyclical factors have dissipated, 
growth in business investment will be determined by struc-
tural factors . As documented in the April Report, these 
structural factors are less favourable than in the past: the 
Bank’s current estimate of potential output growth is about 
1 percentage point lower than its average over the past 
25 years, since demographic factors are weighing on labour 
input and growth in productivity has been relatively slow . 

These trends imply weaker future demand and less need for 
businesses to invest . 
Given these factors, the Bank now expects growth in US busi-
ness investment to average around 3 per cent over 2017–18, 
File information 
down from 4 per cent in the July Report . This has important

Growth prospects in other advanced economies remain 
modest
The wider economic and geopolitical consequences of the United 
Kingdom’s decision to exit the European Union (Brexit) continue to be dif-
ficult to forecast. The initial confidence effects associated with Brexit appear 
to have weighed less heavily on global economic activity than expected 
in July. The euro area, in particular, has been more resilient than antici-
pated, as illustrated by the strength in soft indicators, such as Purchasing 
Managers’ Indexes and measures of economic sentiment. 

In Japan, the recently announced fiscal stimulus should provide a modest 
boost to growth over the remainder of this year and throughout 2017. In 
addition, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has introduced two major components 
into its monetary policy framework: “yield curve control,” in which the BoJ 
will seek to control both short- and long-term interest rates; and an “inflation-
overshooting commitment,” in which the BoJ commits to expand the mon-
etary base until consumer price inflation exceeds the 2 per cent target and 
remains stable above the target.

Emerging markets continue to drive global growth, 
but they face challenges
Growth in China is projected to slow gradually to 6.3 per cent by 2018. 
Previously announced fiscal support and rapid credit expansion appear 
to be boosting growth in spending on infrastructure and in the housing 
sector. While these developments are helping to replace some lost demand 
from slowing investment in mining and manufacturing industries, they may 
exacerbate financial vulnerabilities by increasing leverage, particularly in 
unprofitable state-owned enterprises.

In oil-importing EMEs, the associated drag on growth will wane as recessions 
in some countries, including Brazil, reach their troughs. Economic growth 
should also be supported by progress on growth-enhancing initiatives, such 
as major tax reforms in India and a pledge by Indonesian authorities to ramp 
up spending on infrastructure projects. The overall growth profile, however, 
has been marked down since July because weak global investment and 
the strengthening currencies of major EMEs are expected to restrain export 
growth.

The Bank continues to expect growth in the rest of the world to strengthen 
over the projection horizon as the ongoing adjustment to low oil prices in 
oil-exporting EMEs progresses.

Commodity prices have remained relatively stable
Global oil price benchmarks have been fluctuating near levels assumed in 
the July Report. Prices for Western Canada Select—one of the main pricing 
benchmarks for Western Canadian producers—have been slightly lower, 
on average, mainly because of the resolution of production outages in 
Alberta. By convention, the Bank assumes that oil prices will remain near 
their recent average levels: about US$48, US$46 and US$32 for Brent, West 
Texas Intermediate and Western Canada Select, respectively (see Box 3 on 
page 8).

Recent developments, including the production target proposed by the 
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), have influenced 
oil price movements, but have not materially changed the Bank’s view on 

 

 

6 

 

Global EConoMy 
BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POlICy REPORT  •  OCTOBER 2016

the pace of rebalancing in the oil market. In response to lower oil prices over 
the past two years, the supply adjustment is progressing (Chart 3). In this 
context, risks to the Bank’s oil price assumption remain tilted to the upside 
over 2017–18: solid demand growth is expected to continue, while supply 
growth will be constrained by the deep cuts to capital investment over the 
past two years and the lag between oil investment and production. 

The Bank of Canada’s non-energy commodity price index is modestly lower 
than it was at the time of the July Report, driven mainly by weaker agricul-
tural prices. Looking ahead, this index should remain near its current level, 
with movements in prices of different commodity components offsetting 
each other. A modest decline in metal prices is expected, reflecting slower 
growth in both investment and production in commodity-intensive industries 
in China, combined with strong supply growth from previously built mines 
in other countries. In contrast, lumber prices should remain elevated, with 
support from strong growth in the US housing market.

Canadian Economy

The adjustment of the Canadian economy to low commodity prices is pro-
gressing against a backdrop of weak but improving global demand. The drag 
from declining investment spending in the energy sector is waning, and there 
are early indications that economic activity in resource-related sectors may 
be bottoming out. The broader economic impact of lower real incomes from 
the commodity price decline is nonetheless expected to continue to dampen 
domestic demand for some time as this difficult adjustment proceeds. 
Meanwhile, activity outside resource sectors is growing at a solid pace, driven 
by an expanding service sector and supported by the past depreciation of the 
Canadian dollar. At the same time, subdued foreign demand and persistent 
competitiveness challenges are restraining the pace of export growth.

Real GDP is expected to grow at a rate above that of potential output, 
starting in the second half of 2016 (Box 3). Economic activity is supported 
by accommodative monetary and financial conditions and fiscal measures 
(Table 2). The forecast for real GDP growth has been revised down since 
the July Report, primarily because of a weaker outlook for exports and the 
housing market. The output gap is now expected to close around mid-2018, 
materially later than anticipated in July.

Box 3

Key Inputs to the Base-Case Projection
The Bank’s projection is always conditioned on several 
key assumptions, and changes to these assumptions will 
have important eﬀ ects on the outlook for the global and 
Canadian economies . The Bank regularly reviews these 
assumptions and assesses the sensitivity of the economic 
projection to them . 
The fi rst assumption is that oil prices will remain near their 
recent average levels . The per-barrel prices in US dollars 
for Brent, West Texas Intermediate and Western Canada 
Select have recently averaged about $48, $46 and $32, 
respectively . The profi le for these prices is broadly in line 
with that assumed in the July Report . 
By convention, the Bank does not attempt to forecast the 
exchange rate in the base-case projection . Therefore, the 
second assumption is that the Canadian dollar will remain 
close to its recent average of 76 cents over the projection 
horizon . The Canadian dollar has changed little since the 
July Report, partly because of the relative stability of com-
modity prices . 

The third assumption is that the output gap is -1 .5 per 
cent, the midpoint of a range of 1 to 2 per cent, which is 
the Bank’s estimate of excess capacity in the Canadian 
economy in the third quarter of 2016 . This assumption 
compares with the July assumption of an output gap of 
-1 .7 per cent for the second quarter . 
The fourth assumption is that Canadian potential output 
growth will be at the midpoint of the Bank’s estimated 
range, unchanged from July (Table 2) . Further details on the 
Bank’s assessment of potential output are provided in the 
Appendix to the April Report .
The Bank’s fi fth assumption involves the neutral nominal 
policy rate in Canada, estimated to be between 2 .75 per 
cent and 3 .75 per cent . The current projection is based on 
the midpoint of this range, which is unchanged from the July 
assumption . 

The Bank expects inflation to be close to 2 per cent from early 2017 onward, 
when temporary factors will have dissipated and as economic slack is 
absorbed.
Economic growth has resumed
The Canadian economy contracted by 1.6 per cent (at an annualized rate) 
in the second quarter of 2016 (Chart 4). Growth was pulled down by a 
large, broad-based decline in goods exports and the impact of the Alberta 
wildfires, which more than offset the strength in household expenditures 
and government spending. Weak exports of non-commodity goods can be 
linked, in part, to tepid foreign demand. US business investment has been 
very soft over the past three quarters, and activity in the US manufacturing 
sector—an important market for Canadian exports of intermediate goods—
has grown slowly. Past declines in commodity prices, coupled with pro-
duction disruptions, have also contributed to the weakness in commodity 
exports.

The economy is on track for a rebound in the second half of the year, 
reflecting improving exports, a return to full oil sands production and the 
rebuilding activity in Alberta. Real GDP increased in July across a number 
of industries, particularly non-conventional oil production. Goods exports 
posted gains in July and August, following a sharp contraction over the 
previous five months, but not enough to make up for previously lost 
ground. Looking through volatility in the data, service exports have steadily 
improved, but the level of goods exports has only returned to where it was 
a year ago (Chart 5). Underpinned by a pickup in the US economy, exports 
are expected to continue recovering.

In addition, the rollout of the Canada Child Benefit is anticipated to start

2016, and the federal infrastructure spending announced in March as part 
of Budget 2016 should begin to have a more material impact. However, the

Average growth over the third and fourth quarters of 2016 is expected to 
be about 2 1/2 per cent (Table 3). This is lower than anticipated in the July 
Report, reflecting a downward revision to exports, a pullback in housing 
activity and a shift in the timing of the implementation of federal infrastruc-
ture measures that pushes some of the impact into 2017.

Economic slack continues to put downward pressure on 
inflation
Estimates from the Bank’s two measures of economic slack (the structural 
and statistical approaches) point to material excess capacity.1 Responses 
to the Bank’s autumn Business Outlook Survey indicate that pressures on 
production capacity are little changed and remain below their long-term 
average.

Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey and the Survey of Employment, 
Payrolls and Hours, together with interprovincial migration data, continue 
to provide evidence of ongoing adjustment in labour markets to the past 
decline in commodity prices: employment is weak in energy-intensive 
regions and labour continues to migrate out of Alberta. In contrast, employ-
ment gains in the service sector, particularly in Ontario, British Columbia 
and Quebec, have been strong over the past year, and Ontario and British 
Columbia have seen provincial in-migration. Overall, the national labour 
market has been resilient.

Taking a range of measures into account, the Bank’s labour market indicator 
has edged up and shows that there continues to be more economic slack 
than the national unemployment rate would suggest. The Bank judges that 
excess capacity in the economy in the third quarter was between 1 and 
2 per cent.

Total CPI inflation remains in the lower half of the Bank’s inflation-control 
range, with the temporary boost from the pass-through of the earlier 
exchange rate depreciation more than offset by downward pressures from 
low consumer energy prices and persistent excess capacity. Total inflation 
eased from 1.3 per cent in July to 1.1 per cent in August. This latest reading 

1 

In the third quarter, the Bank’s structural (integrated framework) estimate of the output gap is 
-2.2 per cent, and the statistical (extended multivariate filter) estimate is -1.1 per cent. The time series 
of these two measures can be found at Statistics > Indicators > Indicators of Capacity and Inflation 
Pressures for Canada on the Bank’s website.

was weaker than anticipated, reflecting lower inflation for food and gasoline, 
as well as sector-specific shocks to telecommunications prices. Total CPI 
inflation is expected to move up over the coming months as gasoline prices 
exert less downward pressure.

Most measures of core inflation remain close to 2 per cent but have eased 
somewhat since the July Report. Without the impact of exchange rate pass-
through, these measures would be somewhat lower, reflecting disinflationary 
pressures associated with ongoing economic slack (Chart 6).

The drag on growth from the commodity price decline is 
waning
The adjustment in industries most affected by commodity prices is well 
under way, and activity in the rest of the economy is expanding solidly 
(Chart 7). In response to persistently lower prices, oil firms have been cut-
ting capital expenditures and reducing labour. The investment cuts are 
expected to diminish toward the end of 2016, leaving investment in the 
oil and gas sector about 60 per cent below its level in 2014. The autumn 
Business Outlook Survey found that many businesses believe resource-
related activity may be bottoming out. Resource-related firms generally 
expect sales to level off at this new lower level or to increase modestly over 
the next 12 months.

An integral part of the economy’s adjustment to the commodity price shock 
is the relatively solid growth in the service sector, which is supporting job 
creation, incomes and domestic demand (Box 4). Moreover, Business 
Outlook Survey responses indicate that the balance of opinion on firms’ 
assessments of the impact of the lower Canadian dollar and weaker com-
modity prices on their business outlook has shifted from very negative to 
positive over the past five quarters (Chart 8).

Real GDP is projected to grow by 1.1 per cent in 2016 and about 2 per cent 
in 2017 and 2018 (Table 2 and Table 3). The Bank expects solid household 
spending to continue to be the main contributor to growth, with additional 
support from government spending and exports in 2017. The contribution 
from business investment is anticipated to turn positive by the start of 2017 
and to subsequently increase.

Canada’s Service Sector Is Driving Economic Growth
The service sector makes an important contribution to overall 
economic growth: it accounts for about 70 per cent of the 
economy and four out of every fi ve jobs . As the economy 
adjusts to low commodity prices, Canada’s service sector has 
continued to expand at a steady pace, while growth in the 
goods sector has slowed markedly . Service sector exports 
have increased steadily, particularly commercial and travel 
services . Following years of stable growth, service exports 
as a share of total exports are now about equal to exports of 
motor vehicles and parts and exceed energy exports .
Although some service industries closely tied to oil 
exploration activity, such as architectural and engineering 
services, have seen activity contract sharply, many busi-
nesses in other service industries have continued to show 
strength (Chart 4-A) . A number of small industries have 
been particularly fast-growing, including air transportation, 
fi nancial investment services, motion picture and sound 
recording, and computer systems design and other infor-
mation services .
The contribution of the service sector to overall economic 
activity is refl ected in job gains, wages and income growth . 
File information 
Nearly 250,000 jobs have been created in the service 
(for internal use only): 
sector since the end of 2014, while jobs in the goods sector 
serv_ind  -- EN.indd
Last output: 10/18/16
declined by about 70,000 . Employment in information, 

culture and recreation services has trended strongly 
upward; job gains in accommodation services have almost 
erased the losses that followed the collapse of commodity 
prices; and job growth in fi nance, insurance and real estate 
has been steady . While the average wage in service indus-
tries remains lower than that in goods industries, most of 
the increase in employment since the latter part of 2014 
has been in service industries that pay above-average 
wages .
Income generated in the service sector has contributed 
to the resilience in national income and has supported 
domestic demand more broadly . Income growth among 
service sector workers has more than oﬀ set the declines in 
the goods sector, keeping overall income growth fi rmly in 
positive territory (Chart 4-B) .
The Bank recently consulted with export-oriented fi rms in 
the information technology service industry—a small but 
dynamic segment of the service sector with ties to many 
other industries, given the accelerating global trend toward 
digitalization . Firms that operate in these industries tend to

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POlICy REPORT  •  OCTOBER 2016

Exports and investment are expected to grow at a 
moderate pace
Exports are expected to pick up and grow at a moderate pace over the 
projection horizon as foreign demand improves. Together with services 
exports, several goods components, such as aircraft and related parts and 
pharmaceutical and medicinal products, are expected to lead the recovery 
in non-commodity exports. In addition, Canadian oil production and exports 
are expected to post gains over the projection horizon, although the declines 
in energy sector investment that followed the oil price shock will restrain 
the pace of growth over the next two years. In the non-energy commodity 
sector, there could be downside risks to Canadian lumber exports, if the 
United States imposes countervailing duties following the expiration of the 
Softwood Lumber Agreement.

The average rate of growth projected for exports over 2017 and 2018 is 
lower than anticipated in July. The projection for US economic activity now 
has slower business investment growth and a lower track for residential 
investment, reflecting the trend to smaller houses. In addition, the persistent 
weakness in Canadian non-commodity goods exports this year suggests 
that competitiveness challenges will be more pronounced than previously 
anticipated. The downward revision to exports, including spillovers to 
domestic demand and imports, lowers real GDP by 0.6 per cent by the end 
of 2018.

One issue that appears to be more important than previously assessed is 
the competitiveness of Canada against other countries in the US market. 
US non-energy goods imports from Canada have stagnated, while those 
from competing countries have increased (Chart 9). The foreign exchange 
value of the Canadian dollar is one relevant factor: although the Canadian 
dollar depreciated against the US dollar in recent years, which improved 
Canada’s export competitiveness, competitors for US market share have 
also experienced currency depreciations, in some cases by more than that 
for the Canadian dollar. The Mexican peso, for example, has fallen by over 
30 per cent against the US dollar since mid-2014, compared with less than

20 per cent for the Canadian dollar. The Canadian-dollar exchange rate will 
continue to support the level of exports, although most of the impact on the 
growth rate has likely already occurred.

Other factors, such as energy cost differentials, rising non-tariff trade bar-
riers, uncertainty about the status of current and future trade agreements, 
and slow and complex project approval processes, may also be impeding 
Canada’s ability to benefit from an improving global outlook. These factors 
also affect firms’ choice of location for production: exporting firms have been 
able to respond to increases in export demand through their foreign facili-
ties located close to the source of demand rather than exclusively through 
Canadian exports. In this context, persistent productivity underperformance 
and stronger relative wage gains in Canada have been working to gradually 
erode the competitiveness of Canadian exports, despite the depreciation of 
the Canadian dollar in recent years (Chart 10).

The outlook for exports remains subject to considerable uncertainty, which 
has significant implications for the economic projection. For example, 
growth in exports that is 1 percentage point weaker than expected in both 
2017 and 2018 could lower the level of real GDP by as much as 0.5 per cent 
by the end of the projection horizon.2 In this simulation as well as in the 
base-case projection, the direct impact of weaker exports on GDP is miti-
gated by the fewer imports needed as inputs into exports.

While the weaker profile for exports in the base-case projection will translate 
into somewhat softer business investment, growth in investment is expected 
to turn positive in 2017 and to gradually pick up over the projection horizon. 
The autumn Business Outlook Survey results show that more firms than in 
recent surveys plan to increase investment over the next 12 months. Plans 
to increase investment are more widespread among service-oriented firms

and often involve smaller-scale expenditures on information technology. 
Intentions to increase investment remain weak among firms in the more 
investment-intensive manufacturing sector. As exports increase and more 
firms start to face capacity constraints, investment in the non-commodity 
sector is still expected to rise.

Household spending is expected to remain solid, 
supported by fiscal measures
National growth in household spending has held up as employment and 
income have continued to rise outside the energy-intensive provinces 
(Chart 11). While the negative wealth and income effects from the past 
decline in Canada’s terms of trade will continue to restrain household 
spending, accommodative monetary policy is an ongoing source of support. 
Consumption should continue to grow at a healthy pace, with government 
transfers providing a boost in the near term and the adverse impact of the 
past deterioration of the terms of trade slowly dissipating.

Residential investment was strong in the first half of 2016, particularly in 
the housing markets in British Columbia and Ontario. A slowdown in resale 
activity in British Columbia that began in May intensified in August. An 
additional property transfer tax for foreign buyers in the Greater Vancouver 
Regional District was also introduced in August. Nonetheless, prices in 
Vancouver remain elevated, and resale activity and housing starts continue 
to be robust in the Greater Toronto Area. The recently announced federal 
measures to promote stability in the housing market are expected to lead to 
weaker resale activity in the near term and a modest change in the compos-
ition of residential construction toward smaller units. These measures leave

the level of real GDP 0.3 per cent lower at the end of 2018.3 In line with these 
changes, the contribution of residential investment to real GDP growth is 
expected to be lower on average than anticipated in July. While household 
indebtedness has continued to increase, the new measures are expected 
to dampen household vulnerabilities over time, in part, by improving the 
average credit quality of new borrowing.

Fiscal stimulus will be an important contributor to GDP growth, with house-
hold transfers and infrastructure measures having an overall impact of 
1 per cent on the level of GDP by the end of the 2017–18 fiscal year.4

Inflation is expected to move close to 2 per cent
The disinflationary effect of low consumer energy prices and the inflationary 
effect of exchange rate pass-through are expected to largely dissipate 
by the end of 2016. Total inflation is expected to be close to 2 per cent in 
2017 and 2018. Remaining excess capacity will continue to be a source of 
modest disinflationary pressure through 2017 and into 2018 (Chart 12).

The profile for inflation is slightly lower than expected in July, since in 
the base-case projection the output gap is now somewhat wider and is 
expected to close later than previously anticipated.

3  The Bank’s estimate of the effects of the measures incorporates model simulations as well as the his-
torical experience following changes to housing regulations and is driven by weaker residential invest-
ment and spillover effects to income and consumption. It is important to note that there is considerable 
uncertainty around the overall impact of these new measures on the economy.

4  The overall impact of the fiscal stimulus is unchanged from estimates provided in the April Report.

expectations shows inflation averaging 2 per cent through 2025. Results 
from the Bank’s autumn Business Outlook Survey indicate that firms’ 
expectations for inflation over the next two years remain within the Bank’s 
1 to 3 per cent inflation-control range.

Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, a reasonable range 
around the base-case projection for total CPI inflation is ±0.3 percentage 
points. This range is intended to convey a sense of forecast uncertainty. A 
fan chart, which is derived using statistical analysis of the Bank’s forecast 
errors, provides a complementary perspective (Chart 13).

Risks to thE inflation outlook  19 

Risks to the inflation outlook

With this Report, the content and format of the Risks section have been 
revised. More information is provided on developments related to risks—
both what has happened since the previous Report and what is being 
monitored in the near term. This information highlights the indicators 
being monitored but is not necessarily comprehensive. It will help clarify 
the Bank’s assessment of when a risk may be receding and will likely 
be dropped in a future Report; when a risk may become less important 
because aspects of it may be materializing, leading to a revision to the 
economic projection; or when the nature of a risk may be changing, for 
example, from being one- to two-sided. The evolution of the risks since the 
previous Report is summarized in Table 4.

The outlook for inflation is subject to several upside and downside risks 
emanating from both the external environment and the domestic economy. 
Overall, the Bank assesses that the risks to the projected path for inflation 
are roughly balanced. As in past reports, the focus is on a selection of risks 
identified as the most important for the projected path for inflation, drawing 
from a larger set of risks taken into account in the projection.

(i)  Stronger real GDP growth in the United States

The Bank’s projection for US potential GDP growth could reflect an 
overly conservative interpretation of labour market and productivity 
trends. In addition, global uncertainty has increased recently, exacer-
bated by heightened political uncertainty and rising protectionist 
sentiment. Either favourable dissipation of this uncertainty or stronger 
growth in the structural drivers of the US economy could result in 
improved US business confidence and investment, with positive spill-
overs for Canadian exports.

(ii)  Higher oil prices

Strengthening demand, as well as supply constraints, could con-
tribute to higher oil prices. Higher-than-expected oil prices would 
improve Canada’s terms of trade and provide a boost to wealth and 
household spending in Canada.

(iii)  Sluggish business investment in Canada

The recent weakness in business investment could reflect more 
persistent structural factors. Over time, weaker business investment 
would also reduce capital deepening and lower potential output, par-
tially mitigating the disinflationary effect of weaker demand.

(iv)  Slower growth in emerging-market economies

Growth could be slower in some EMEs, particularly commodity 
exporters and those with elevated US-dollar-denominated debt. 
There are risks around China’s rebalancing, particularly given a further 
buildup of financial imbalances. Slower EME growth could affect 
Canada through weaker commodity prices and export sales, as well 
as through greater global uncertainty and financial volatility.

(v)  Weaker household spending

Given the high level of household indebtedness, households may also 
become more prudent, restraining consumption and housing expendi-
tures. Weaker-than-expected household spending would have a direct 
negative impact on real GDP.

Canada’s Inflation-Control Strategy1
Inflation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote 

the economic and financial well-being of Canadians.

pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s 
outlook, including risks to the projection, are published four 
times per year in the Monetary Policy Report.

  Canada’s experience with inflation targeting since 1991 has 

shown that the best way to foster confidence in the value 
of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth, 
employment gains and improved living standards is by keeping 
inflation low, stable and predictable.

Inflation targeting is symmetric and flexible
  Canada’s inflation-targeting approach is symmetric, which 

means that the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising 
above or falling below the 2 per cent target.

  In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 

Canada’s inflation-control target for a further five-year period, 
ending December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the 
consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 per cent midpoint 
of the control range of 1 to 3 per cent.

  Canada’s inflation-targeting framework is flexible. Typically, 

the Bank seeks to return inflation to target over a horizon of six 
to eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for 
returning inflation to target will vary depending on the nature 
and persistence of the shocks buffeting the economy.

The monetary policy instrument
  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes in the 

target for the overnight rate of interest.2 These changes are 
transmitted to the economy through their influence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate, 
which affect total demand for Canadian goods and services. 
The balance between this demand and the economy’s 
production capacity is, over time, the primary determinant of 
inflation pressures in the economy.

  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight 
quarters—to work their way through the economy and have 
their full effect on inflation. For this reason, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent com-
munications, the Bank regularly reports its perspective on 
the forces at work on the economy and their implications for 
inflation. The Monetary Policy Report is a key element of this 
approach. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight 

Monitoring inflation
  In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in 
indirect taxes such as GST, can cause sizable fluctuations in 
CPI.

  In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through 

such transitory movements in CPI inflation and focuses on a 
set of “core” inflation measures that better reflect the under-
lying trend of inflation. In this sense, these measures act as an 
operational guide to help the Bank achieve the CPI inflation 
target. They are not a replacement for CPI inflation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core inflation are CPI-
trim, which excludes CPI components whose rates of change 
in a given month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which 
corresponds to the price change located at the 50th percentile 
(in terms of basket weight) of the distribution of price changes; 
and CPI-common, which uses a statistical procedure to track 
common price changes across categories in the CPI basket.

Inflation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide additional  monetary 

stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website, 
describes these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Global Economy

Global economic growth is expected to moderate to a more sustainable 
pace of around 3 1/2 per cent in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1). Growth in the 
second half of 2018 is estimated to have eased by somewhat more than 
forecast in October, due primarily to temporary factors in the euro area and 
Japan. The US economy remained robust, supported by fiscal stimulus 
(Chart 1).

The global outlook continues to face important uncertainties. The United 
States and China have taken some positive steps but have not yet reached 
an agreement on trade issues. The dispute is reducing US–China trade 
in products subject to the increases in tariffs (Chart 2) and is weighing 
on activity and sentiment globally. Among other geopolitical tensions, the 
future of Brexit is unclear as the scheduled date for the United Kingdom’s 
departure from the European Union approaches. The nature and timing of 
any resolution of these issues are difficult to predict. The Bank continues 
to incorporate the adverse effects of uncertainty and the impact of tariff 
actions into its outlook.1

1  The impact of the US–China tariffs discussed in the October Report remains in place in the Bank’s 

base-case projection, with the exception that the tariff increases scheduled for January are now 
delayed until March. The Bank’s base case continues to assume an orderly Brexit, with modest nega-
tive effects from uncertainty.

Last observation: October 2018
Sources: United States Census Bureau and Bank of Canada calculations 

The confluence of trade conflicts, geopolitical tensions and emerging signs 
of their economic impacts is leading markets to reassess global growth 
prospects and reprice most asset classes. Many private sector forecasts for 
global growth have been revised down. There has been no net change in the 
Bank’s forecast for growth in 2019 because impacts of trade and geopolit-
ical tensions had already been incorporated.

Oil prices have fallen since the October Monetary Policy Report, driven 
by stronger supply and concerns about weaker global demand. Lower oil 
prices are expected to provide a modest boost to growth in oil-importing 
countries while dampening growth for oil exporters.

Financial markets continue to reprice risks
Market unease over global growth has contributed to an overall decline in 
equity prices and bond yields, increased volatility and a broad-based wid-
ening in corporate credit spreads (Chart 3). A tightening of corporate credit 
conditions has been particularly evident in the North American energy 
sector, given the decline in oil prices.

In 2018, central banks in many countries were taking steps to gradually 
normalize monetary policy. Amid indications that trade and geopolitical 
tensions are taking a toll on activity, markets now anticipate that major cen-
tral banks will withdraw less monetary stimulus in 2019 than previously 
expected. In conjunction with falling government bond yields, the US yield 
curve has flattened further.

Meanwhile, portfolio inflows to emerging-market economies (EMEs) have 
resumed since a mid-year sell-off, and most EMEs have seen their curren-
cies appreciate from the low levels of last year.

Oil prices have declined materially
Global oil prices have recently averaged about 25 per cent lower than 
assumed in the October Report. Steadily increasing US oil production has 
been an important driver of the low prices. Global oil output was estimated 
to be about 3 million barrels per day higher in the fourth quarter of 2018 than 
in the same period in 2017, about two-thirds of which was due to higher US 
production (Chart 4). Since October, rising US shale production and output 
from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 
(OPEC) have contributed to the price declines, alongside concerns that 
trade and geopolitical risks could weigh on global demand.

Last data plotted: 2018Q4 

Looking ahead, OPEC and some non-OPEC oil-producing countries have 
agreed to cut output over the first half of 2019 to help offset some of the 
supply increases. In Canada, mandatory production curtailments for 2019, 
announced by the Alberta government in early December, have narrowed 
the differential between prices received by western Canadian producers 
and global benchmarks (Box 1, page 9).

There is considerable uncertainty around the future path for global oil 
prices. The most important considerations are whether supply continues 
to outpace demand and whether market concerns about the US–China 
conflict abate.

The Bank’s non-energy commodity price index is modestly weaker than 
in October. The market reassessment of global growth prospects has 
been reflected in further declines in prices for base metals and agricultural 
products.

US growth is expected to ease to a more sustainable pace
The US economy has continued to expand at a pace well above potential 
in recent quarters. Consumption growth has been bolstered by the strong 
labour market and the 2018 tax cuts. Business investment growth continues 
to be healthy, even though it has softened recently. Meanwhile, residential 
investment is being held back by deteriorating affordability and supply con-
straints. Trade in goods subject to increases in tariffs has declined in recent 
months, with agricultural and steel and aluminum products most affected. 
There are signs that US producers facing higher tariffs from China are 
finding new markets, which has helped mitigate the impact of the tariffs on 
total exports. For instance, US exports of agricultural products to countries 
other than China have increased sharply.

Over the projection horizon, growth of US gross domestic product (GDP) 
is expected to moderate to around 21/2 per cent in 2019 and around 
11/2 per cent in 2020. This leaves US growth somewhat below the Bank’s 

 
 

banK oF CanaDa  •  MonEtaRy PoliCy REPoRt  •  JanuaRy 2019

Global EConoMy  5 

estimate of US potential output growth at the end of the projection horizon. 
The slowdown mainly reflects the waning of fiscal stimulus, the adverse 
impact of trade actions and related uncertainty, and less accommodative 
monetary policy.

Core inflation has remained close to 2 per cent in recent months and is 
expected to stay near the Federal Reserve’s inflation target as growth 
moderates.

Euro area growth has disappointed
Growth in the euro area was weaker in the third quarter of 2018 than 
expected. The auto sector played a key role in the weakness because auto-
makers were adjusting to new emission standards. Recent survey data 
indicate a broader softening in both services and manufacturing activity, 
suggesting that trade policy uncertainty and geopolitical tensions are 
starting to have a negative impact on the economy. Consumer confidence 
has fallen in the face of fiscal challenges in Italy, renewed uncertainty about 
Brexit and social unrest in France. The labour market has nonetheless con-
tinued to improve, as reflected by rising wage growth.

The Bank expects the euro area economy to grow at a rate just above 
potential output growth over the projection horizon, supported in part by 
solid foreign demand and low oil prices. Core inflation remains subdued and 
is anticipated to rise only gradually.

Growth in EMEs is moderating
Growth in China is expected to moderate from around 6 1/2 per cent in 
2018 to just below 6 per cent in 2020. Policy-makers are continuing to pro-
vide support to offset headwinds from trade tensions and deleveraging. 
The adverse effects of trade tensions have become more evident in survey 
data about Chinese manufacturing. Authorities have encouraged more 
bank lending, particularly to small and medium-sized enterprises, and have 
announced expansionary fiscal measures.

The financial stress experienced by Argentina and Turkey in 2018 is 
expected to continue to temper growth in oil-importing EMEs in 2019. 
Growth in this group of countries is anticipated to recover to around 
4 1/2 per cent in 2020. Growth in oil-exporting EMEs has been revised down 
relative to the October Report, given the fall in oil prices.

Canadian Economy

The Canadian economy has been operating near capacity for over a year 
now. In addition, job growth has been strong, the unemployment rate is at a 
40-year low and inflation is close to target. The main changes to the outlook 
result from developments in oil markets.

GDP growth is estimated to slow temporarily in the fourth quarter of 2018 
and the first quarter of 2019 mainly as a result of the lower oil prices (Table 2 
and Table 3). Overall, the impact of the oil price decline is expected to be 
about one-quarter the size of that in the 2014–16 episode (Chart 5 and 
Box 1). Oil prices have fallen by less than in 2014, and oil production repre-
sents a smaller nominal share of the Canadian economy today.

After this temporary slowdown, the pace of economic activity in Canada is 
expected to average above potential growth. Economic activity should con-
tinue to be supported by strong employment, expanding foreign demand 
and accommodative financial conditions. Business investment and exports 
outside the energy sector are projected to grow steadily and will benefit 
from favourable arrangements with many trading partners and recently 
announced federal tax measures targeting investment. Ongoing gains

in employment and wages should continue to underpin consumption as 
households adjust to the tighter mortgage guidelines and increases in mort-
gage rates. However, housing activity has recently been weaker than antici-
pated and is expected to remain soft over the projection horizon.

The outlook is subject to several sources of uncertainty, including the per-
sistence of the oil price decline and the size of spillovers to non-oil-producing 
regions, the adjustment of household spending to tighter mortgage finance 
guidelines and higher interest rates, and global trade policy and geopolitical 
issues.

Consumer price index (CPI) inflation is estimated at 2 per cent in the fourth 
quarter of 2018. The Bank’s projection for CPI inflation is lower than in the 
October Report, reflecting lower gasoline prices. Inflation is now anticipated 
to decline temporarily before returning to 2 per cent by the end of 2019.

The impact of lower oil prices on the Canadian economy
Developments driving Canadian oil prices
Canadian oil prices had fallen dramatically since the 
summer, before partially recovering in recent weeks 
(Chart 1-A) . Movements in global oil prices were respon-
sible for a large part of the decline . Prices of Canadian oil 
produced in western provinces were depressed further by 
production rising faster than transportation capacity . At 
the start of 2018, transportation constraints were the main 
cause of large discounts on domestic heavy crude (Western 
Canadian Select) prices . By August, transportation pres-
sures and reﬁ nery shutdowns for maintenance also began to 
weigh on the prices of light oil and condensate .1 While some 
bottlenecks are expected to persist over the projection 
horizon, production curtailments announced by the Alberta 
government for 2019 have helped bring Canadian price 
diﬀ erentials closer to their historical averages .

Lower Canadian oil prices soften the economic 
outlook
The Bank’s consultations with ﬁ rms in the energy sector 
suggest that sentiment has deteriorated since the October 
Report . In addition, while announcements of Alberta’s 
curtailment program helped ease price diﬀ erentials, ﬁ rms 
remain concerned about the medium-term outlook . For 

1  Not all oil producers are aﬀ ected equally by the downward pressures exerted by 
transportation constraints on Canadian spot oil prices . Producers with dedicated 
pipeline space or those that own reﬁ neries in the United States or Canada can face 
a lower eﬀ ective discount .

instance, the ongoing lack of export infrastructure continues 
to hamper the ability of many energy ﬁ rms to raise funds in 
debt and equity markets .
The recent developments in Canadian oil prices aﬀ ect the 
Canadian economy through several channels:
•  Since Canada is a net exporter of oil, the recent decline 

in oil prices causes Canada’s terms of trade to fall, which 
in turn reduces domestic income and wealth . This is 
expected to weigh on household spending and ﬁ scal 
revenues, most notably in oil-producing provinces . It will 
also likely have spillover eﬀ ects on sales and production 
in other sectors and regions of the Canadian economy, 
although these are currently expected to be modest .
•  Reduced proﬁ ts associated with oil extraction will likely 
lead ﬁ rms to curtail their investment in the oil and gas 
sector . This investment is expected to decline by about 
12 per cent in 2019, compared with a decline of 1 .5 per cent 
forecast in the October Report . Consultations with ﬁ rms 
also suggest that some are looking to reduce staﬃ  ng levels 
further while trying to make additional eﬃ  ciency gains .

•  A lower Canadian dollar plays an important role in facili-
tating the economy’s adjustment to the oil price shock . 
In particular, the lower Canadian dollar will support 
non-energy exports and employment and also play a 
buﬀ ering role for oil producers .

Box 1 (continued)

•  Lower oil prices have a direct negative impact on gaso-
line prices, a component of the consumer price index .
The decline in oil prices since last summer, all else being 
equal, would be expected to reduce the level of Canadian 
gross domestic product (GDP) by about 0 .5 per cent by 
the end of 2020 . The impact on the Canadian economy 
is anticipated to be about one-quarter as large as what 
occurred during the 2014–16 episode, for three key reasons:
•  The Bank’s energy price index has fallen by about 25 per 

cent since the July Report . In comparison, it fell by 
roughly 70 per cent from a peak in the second quarter 
of 2014 to a trough in the ﬁ rst quarter of 2016 .

•  The share of the Canadian oil and gas sector in total 
business investment is now estimated to be around 
15 per cent, compared with around 30 per cent in 2014 . 
At the same time, the nominal share of oil and gas pro-
duction in Canadian GDP is estimated to have decreased 
from 6 per cent in 2014 to 3 1/2 per cent in 2018 .

•  Energy ﬁ rms are better equipped to operate in a low-

price environment than they were in 2014 because they 
have innovated and improved eﬃ  ciency, including by 
cutting overhead costs . 

Output growth is estimated to slow temporarily
Real GDP grew by 2 per cent in the third quarter of 2018, but with a different 
composition of growth than anticipated in the October Report. GDP growth 
was supported by government spending and exports, while private domestic 
demand was weak. Growth of consumption and residential investment 
slowed markedly. Business investment fell in the third quarter, with notable 
weakness in the energy sector and a transitory decline in spending on air-
craft and other transportation equipment. Some of the weakness in invest-
ment also likely reflected the impact of elevated trade policy uncertainty.

The Bank estimates that growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first 
quarter of 2019 will average about 1 per cent as low oil prices and adjust-
ment in the housing market create headwinds to growth (Table 3 and 
Chart 6). This outlook is about 11/4 percentage points weaker on average 
than in the October Report, with the further decline in oil prices since 
October explaining more than half of the revision.

Provincial and municipal housing market policies, the tighter mortgage finance 
guidelines and higher mortgage rates continue to weigh on housing activity. 
Slowing of activity in some markets has been associated with less speculative 
activity. As a result, it is difficult to evaluate the sensitivity of non-speculative 
demand to the various policy changes. Monthly indicators have signalled that 
spending on housing likely contracted again in the fourth quarter. Weaker-
than-expected housing activity in recent months and staff analysis suggest 
that the combined effect of tighter mortgage guidelines and higher interest 
rates has been larger than previously estimated. The Bank will continue to 
monitor developments in housing markets to assess how construction is 
adjusting to the shift in demand toward lower-value units.

Investment in the energy sector is expected to contract because of low oil 
prices and production curtailments in Alberta. In autumn 2018, historically 
high production levels coupled with temporary maintenance shutdowns of 
US refineries contributed to a large buildup in inventories of crude oil and a 
decline in prices of western Canadian oil relative to global price benchmarks. 
The completion of US refinery maintenance and lower production near the 
end of the fourth quarter initiated an inventory correction. The drawdown of 
inventories should continue with the mandated curtailments of Alberta oil 
production that took effect at the start of 2019. These inventory movements 
added to GDP growth in the second half of 2018 and are expected to subtract

from it in the first quarter of 2019. As a result, real GDP growth is expected to 
remain slow in the first quarter, even though growth of final domestic demand 
should pick up. In contrast, in most industries, solid foreign demand, ongoing 
capacity pressures and the signing of the Canada-United States-Mexico 
Agreement (CUSMA) are expected to support business investment.

Most of the economy is operating close to capacity
Labour markets continue to be healthy: employment growth is strong and 
the unemployment rate is at a 40-year low. Most firms outside oil-producing 
regions continue to report some or significant capacity pressures and inten-
sifying labour shortages, as noted in the winter Business Outlook Survey. 
Labour pressures are subsiding in areas affected by the fall in oil prices 
(Chart 7). The slowing of overall wage growth over the past year is being 
driven by developments in oil-producing regions. Elsewhere, wage growth 
has remained steady since the beginning of 2017 (Chart 8). Against this 
backdrop, job churn has been increasing, which is an encouraging sign for 
future wage growth.2

The Bank estimates that the output gap was between -1 and 0 per cent in 
the fourth quarter of 2018 (Box 2). This range implies more slack than was 
assumed in the October Report, mainly reflecting that growth in the fourth 
quarter is estimated to have been slower than potential.3 However, the 
increase in slack is likely to be contained to oil-producing regions.

Core inflation measures have been tracking close to 2 per cent, consistent 
with an economy that has been operating near capacity (Chart 9). CPI infla-
tion was 1.7 per cent in November as the drag from gasoline prices more than 
offset the temporary effects of tariffs and past increases in minimum wages.

2  See O. Kostyshyna and C. Luu, “The State of Labour Market Churn in Canada,” Bank of Canada Staff 

Analytical Note (forthcoming).

3  The output gap in the fourth quarter also reflects revisions to historical data that suggest the gap was 

somewhat wider than expected in previous quarters (Box 2).

Key inputs to the base-case projection
The Bank’s projection is always conditional on several key 
assumptions, and changes to them will aﬀ ect the outlook 
for the global and Canadian economies . The Bank regularly 
reviews these assumptions and assesses the sensitivity of the 
economic projection to them . The Bank’s current assump-
tions are as follows:
•  Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent average 

levels . The per-barrel prices in US dollars for Brent, West 
Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western Canadian Select 
(WCS) have recently averaged close to $60, $50 and 
$30, respectively . Brent and WTI are about $20 lower 
than assumed in the October Report, while WCS is about 
$5 lower .

•  By convention, the Bank does not forecast the exchange 

rate in its base-case projection . The Canadian dollar is 
assumed to remain at 74 cents over the projection horizon, 
close to its recent average and somewhat lower than the 
77 cents assumed in the October Report .

gap in the third quarter of 2018 was in a range of -0 .5 to 
+0 .5 per cent .

•  The annual growth rate of potential output is assumed to 

average around 1 .9 per cent over the projection horizon 
(Table 2) . The proﬁ le is slightly below the assumption in 
the October Report, refl ecting the softer trajectory for 
business investment . Details on the Bank’s assessment 
of potential output are provided in the Appendix to the 
April 2018 Report, and new estimates will be provided in 
the April 2019 Report .

•  The neutral nominal policy rate is deﬁ ned as the real rate 
consistent with output remaining sustainably at its poten-
tial and with infl ation at target, on an ongoing basis, plus 
2 per cent for infl ation . It is a medium- to long-term equi-
librium concept . For Canada, the neutral rate is estimated 
to be between 2 .5 and 3 .5 per cent . The economic projec-
tion is based on the midpoint of this range, the same rate 
as in the October Report .

•  Revisions to historical data going back to 2012 suggest 

•  Since April 2017, the Bank’s base-case scenarios have 

that the levels of investment and gross domestic product 
(GDP) over recent years have been lower than previously 
estimated . As a result, the Bank’s estimate of the proﬁ le of 
potential output over recent years has been revised down 
relative to the October Report . The levels of GDP and 
potential output in the second quarter of 2018 are lower by 
0 .8 per cent and 0 .6 per cent, respectively .

•  The Bank estimates that the output gap was in a range 

of -1 .0 to 0 .0 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018 . This 
compares with the October assumption that the output 

incorporated some negative judgment on investment and 
export growth to account for the eﬀ ects of uncertainty 
around trade policy and the expected loss of investment 
competitiveness due to the US tax reform . Trade policy 
uncertainty is expected to reduce the levels of business 
investment and exports by about 0 .5 per cent and 0 .2 per 
cent, respectively, between the fourth quarter of 2018 and 
the fourth quarter of 2020 . The negative impact of the 
US tax reform on GDP is eﬀ ectively oﬀ set by the positive 
impact of the measures targeting investment announced in 
the federal Fall Economic Statement .

After two soft quarters, growth is expected to pick up
The Bank projects that real GDP growth will pick up in the second quarter 
of 2019 and average slightly above potential through the end of the projec-
tion horizon (Chart 10). The solid underpinnings of growth through part of 
2018—including expanding foreign demand, robust immigration flows and a 
low unemployment rate—are expected to continue to support the Canadian 
economy while oil-producing regions adjust to lower oil prices. Outside the 
energy sector, investment and exports are anticipated to grow at a robust 
pace. Meanwhile, growth in household spending is expected to be softer 
than in 2018, primarily reflecting ongoing adjustments to the tighter mort-
gage guidelines and higher interest rates, and the impact of lower oil prices 
on real income and wealth.

Real GDP growth in 2019 has been revised down by 0.4 percentage 
points compared with the October Report (Table 2). Developments in the 
energy sector and announced reductions in Ontario provincial spending 
are expected to more than offset the positive effects of the recent fed-
eral tax measures targeting investment and the impacts of the lower 
Canadian dollar.

Strong non-energy investment will enhance capacity
Overall, business investment is anticipated to expand modestly. While 
spending in the energy sector is expected to contract significantly in 2019, 
investment growth in other sectors is anticipated to be strong.

Firms outside the energy sector are expected to increase investment over 
the projection horizon to alleviate capacity pressures and improve produc-
tivity. The winter Business Outlook Survey found that investment intentions 
remain strong. Ongoing digitalization of business activity should encourage 
capital spending in areas such as research and development, software 
and computer equipment. Moreover, tax measures recently announced by 
the federal government allow firms to write off a larger share of the cost of 
newly acquired assets in the year an investment is made. These tax policy

changes should boost business investment and improve competitive-
ness.4 The signing of the CUSMA is a positive development, and investment 
would be even stronger without elevated uncertainty surrounding global 
trade policy.

In contrast, with lower oil prices, investment in the energy sector is expected 
to decline and be materially weaker over the projection horizon than antici-
pated in the October Report (Chart 11). Recent consultations suggest that 
the sentiment of firms in the sector has turned significantly negative and that 
a contraction in investment can be expected in 2019 (Box 1).

Exports are projected to grow solidly
Exports are expected to grow close to 3 per cent per year over the projec-
tion horizon, a solid pace compared with recent historical experience. This 
outlook is supported by ongoing expansion of foreign demand, the lower 
Canadian dollar and rising production capacity. The implications of recent 
trade agreements are incorporated and are expected to increase exports. 
However, global trade policy uncertainty and competitiveness challenges 
are anticipated to continue to weigh on the outlook for overall exports while 
limited transportation capacity restrains the expansion of energy exports.

Growth of non-commodity exports is expected to be relatively broad-
based (Chart 12). For instance, machinery and equipment exports should 
benefit from rising US business investment, and services-related exports 
are forecast to continue to expand at a strong pace amid ongoing digital-
ization. In contrast, auto sector exports are expected to decline over the 
projection horizon, reflecting changes to production mandates of Canadian 
motor vehicle assemblers, including the scheduled shutdown of the General 
Motors Oshawa plant in 2019.

Commodity exports are anticipated to expand at a moderate pace. The 
growth of non-energy commodity exports should continue to benefit from 
the global expansion. Energy exports are expected to remain steady in 
the near term. Once elevated inventories have been drawn down and new 
transportation capacity becomes available, western Canadian oil prices are 
more likely to remain near recent levels without production curtailments. 
Transportation capacity is expected to expand by about 560,000 barrels per 
day (bpd) by the third quarter of 2019.5 In addition, the Alberta government 
will expand rail capacity by about 120,000 bpd over the first three quarters 
of 2020. With additional transportation capacity, growth of oil production 
and exports is expected to increase in the second half of 2019 and continue 
to pick up over the projection horizon. These expansions of transportation 
capacity will boost exports, but they are not anticipated to be sufficient to 
meet future production.

The growth of imports is expected to slow in 2019, mainly reflecting the 
lower Canadian dollar and weaker domestic demand, before rebounding 
along with a pickup in business investment growth.

Household spending is adjusting to policy changes
Several factors are expected to continue to underpin household spending 
over the projection horizon: population growth (boosted by immigration), 
low unemployment rates, solid wage gains and low gasoline prices. These 
factors will provide support while households adjust to the tighter mort-
gage guidelines, higher borrowing rates and the impacts of the decline in oil 
prices on income and wealth.

5  Rail capacity is expected to expand by 190,000 bpd over the second and third quarters of 2019, and 

the Enbridge Line 3 replacement is scheduled to add 370,000 bpd of pipeline capacity in the third 
quarter of 2019.

Consumption growth is projected to moderate somewhat in 2019–20 com-
pared with 2018. This softening partly reflects the fact that, for some house-
holds, the impact of higher interest rates on consumption is lagged relative 
to actual changes in mortgage rates. This occurs as a result of the renewal 
cycle on fixed-rate mortgages. In light of downward revisions to disposable 
income in recent years, estimates of the savings rate are considerably lower 
than previously thought, suggesting the potential for some downside risks to 
future consumption growth. New home construction and resale activity are 
expected to remain relatively soft over the projection horizon as households 
continue to adjust to policy changes.

The outlooks for consumption and residential investment are being damp-
ened by expected weakness in oil-producing provinces. Because of the 
recent fall in oil prices, income growth in these provinces is expected to 
continue to lag the rest of Canada. In addition, inventories of vacant new 
homes in these areas have risen markedly over the past several years, and 
this latest episode could lead to further increases.

Inflation is expected to be temporarily below 2 per cent
CPI inflation is expected to ease temporarily, reaching about 11/2 per cent 
in the third quarter before returning to around 2 per cent by the end of 2019 
(Chart 13). Two factors are contributing to a lower inflation profile than pro-
jected in the October Report. The effects of recent declines in oil prices 
on gasoline prices are expected to push inflation down by about 0.4 per-
centage points through the third quarter of 2019. As well, weaker growth in 
the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of this year leads to a wid-
ening of the output gap and some additional modest disinflationary pres-
sure, which gradually diminish over the projection horizon. Pass-through 
effects of the lower Canadian dollar provide some offset to these factors.

The base-case projection provides the Bank’s view of the most likely out-
come for inflation, although any projection is subject to considerable 
forecast uncertainty. A 90 per cent confidence band around the infla-
tion projection widens from ±0.6 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 
2018 to ±1.5 percentage points by the end of 2020.

The projection is consistent with medium- and long-term inflation expect-
ations remaining well anchored. Most respondents to the Bank’s winter 
Business Outlook Survey anticipate that inflation will remain within the 
Bank’s target range of 1 to 3 per cent over the next two years. The majority 
expect inflation to be in the upper half of that range. The November 2018 
Consensus Economics forecast for CPI inflation is 2.3 per cent in 2018 and 
2.1 per cent in 2019, with long-term annual inflation expectations averaging 
2.0 per cent through 2028.

Risks to the inflation outlook

The outlook for inflation is subject to several upside and downside risks. 
Overall, the Bank assesses that the risks to the projected path for infla-
tion are roughly balanced. The evolution of the most important risks since 
October is summarized in Table 4. As in past reports, the focus is on those 
risks identified as the most important to the projected path for inflation, 
drawing from a larger set of risks considered in the projection.

(i)  Trade conflict between the United States and China

Trade tensions between the United States and China could worsen if 
current negotiations are unsuccessful, leading to more severe fallout 
than what is included in the projection. The largest downside risk 
would be a major reallocation of production, capital and labour across 
sectors and countries. Canadian exports and business investment 
could suffer from a significant weakening in foreign demand, a break-
down in global value chains, falling business confidence and lower 
commodity prices. At the same time, there could be inflationary pres-
sures from the increase in global input costs associated with higher 
tariffs, from lower productivity and from a lower Canadian dollar.

In contrast, if the United States and China were to reach a broad 
agreement on trade issues, global and Canadian economic activity 
would be stronger than in the base-case projection. As well, the near-
term upward pressure from tariffs on prices would be removed.

(ii)  Outlook for oil prices

Considerable uncertainty remains around the future path of Canadian 
oil prices and production. On the one hand, global prices could 
recover to above the levels assumed in the projection if market 
concerns about the US–China conflict were to subside. On the other 
hand, significant discounting of western Canadian oil prices could 
resume if transportation capacity were not adequately expanded.

(iii)  Stronger Canadian business investment and exports

Momentum in Canadian exports could prove more durable than 
assumed in the Bank’s base-case projection, especially given the 
lower Canadian dollar. In the context of elevated capacity pressures, 
sustained demand growth outside the oil sector and stronger exports 
could lead businesses to increase investment even more to reduce 
capacity pressures. In addition, ratification of the CUSMA could result 

 

 

20  RisKs to thE inFlation outlooK 

banK oF CanaDa  •  MonEtaRy PoliCy REPoRt  •  JanuaRy 2019

 

in a large improvement in business sentiment, leading to stronger 
investment and exports than in the base-case projection. Thus, 
exports could grow faster than foreign demand and recover some of 
the global export market share lost in recent years.

(iv)  Stronger real GDP growth in the United States

GDP growth in the United States could be stronger. For instance, 
recent US tax and regulatory changes could boost investment and 
potential output by more than in the base-case projection. It is also 
possible that additional US fiscal stimulus measures could be enacted 
to avoid a sharp decline in growth in 2020. Canadian investment and 
exports would both benefit from stronger US activity.

(v)  Sharp tightening of global financial conditions

Global financial conditions remain broadly accommodative but could 
tighten suddenly. Several triggers could lead to higher term and risk 
premiums. These include an escalation of trade tensions and tighter 
monetary conditions due to higher-than-expected rates of wage 
and price inflation in advanced economies. Higher bond yields in 
advanced economies could lead to larger capital outflows from EMEs, 
exacerbating country-specific vulnerabilities in some cases. Higher 
yields could also lead to a sharp tightening in corporate credit condi-
tions in advanced economies. These developments could translate 
into a rise in debt-service burdens, a decline in activity in sectors 
sensitive to interest rates, lower commodity prices and weaker global 
and Canadian economic growth.

(vi)  A pronounced decline in house prices in certain regions 

in Canada
House prices in the Toronto area are close to 40 per cent higher than 
they were three years ago. In the Vancouver area, the increase has 
been even larger—about 50 per cent. Speculative activity has been a 
significant factor in the prolonged run-up in prices. Today there is less 
evidence of speculation in some markets, likely due to the combined 
impact of provincial and municipal housing measures, tightened mort-
gage finance guidelines and higher mortgage rates. Average prices 
are levelling off in Toronto, and in Vancouver they are declining mod-
estly. Overall, house prices in Canada are now growing at an annual 
rate of roughly 2 per cent. Nevertheless, price levels remain elevated 
in the greater Vancouver and Toronto areas. Thus, there remains a risk 
of a sharp decline in house prices in these markets as well as in those 
affected by the oil price decline. Such a decline in house prices could 
dampen consumption, housing demand and construction activity.

Canada’s inﬂ ation-control strategy
Canada’s inﬂ ation-control strategy11
Inﬂ ation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote 

the economic and fi nancial well-being of Canadians.

  Canada’s experience with infl ation targeting since 1991 has 

shown that the best way to foster confi dence in the value 
of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth, 
employment gains and improved living standards is by keeping 
infl ation low, stable and predictable.

  In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 

Canada’s infl ation-control target for a further fi ve-year period, 
ending December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the rate 
of infl ation of the consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 
2 percent midpoint of the control range of 1 to 3 percent.

Monetary policy tools
  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight 
quarters—to work their way through the economy and have 
their full effect on infl ation. For this reason, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.

  The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through 

changes in the target for the overnight rate of interest (the 
policy rate).2 The Bank also has a range of other monetary 
policy tools it can use when the policy rate is at very low 
levels. These tools consist of guidance on the future evolution 
of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases (quantitative 
easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures, and 
negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of 
these additional tools would depend on the economic and 
fi nancial market context.

  All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand 
for Canadian goods and services through their infl uence on 
market interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange 
rate. The balance between this demand and the economy’s 
production capacity is, over time, the main factor that 
determines infl ation pressures in the economy.

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent 

communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspectives 
on the economy and infl ation. Policy decisions are typically 
announced on eight pre-set days during the year, and full 
updates of the Bank’s outlook are published four times each 
year in the Monetary Policy Report.

Inﬂ ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible
  Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which 
means that the Bank is equally concerned about infl ation 
rising above or falling below the 2 percent target.

  Canada’s infl ation-targeting framework is fl exible. Typically, 

the Bank seeks to return infl ation to target over a horizon of six 
to eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for 
returning infl ation to target will vary depending on the nature 
and persistence of the shocks buffeting the economy.

Monitoring inﬂ ation
  In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in 
indirect taxes such as GST, can cause sizable fl uctuations in 
CPI infl ation.

  In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through 

such transitory movements in CPI infl ation and focuses 
on a set of “core” infl ation measures that better refl ect the 
underlying trend of infl ation. In this sense, these measures 
act as an operational guide to help the Bank achieve the CPI 
infl ation target. They are not a replacement for CPI infl ation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl ation are 
CPI-trim, which excludes CPI components whose rates of 
change in a given month are the most extreme; CPI-median, 
which corresponds to the price change located at the 50th 
percentile (in terms of basket weight) of the distribution of 
price changes; and CPI-common, which uses a statistical 
procedure to track common price changes across categories 
in the CPI basket.

Overview

Overview 
Overview 

The Canadian and world economies have rebounded sharply from the 
severe downturns experienced with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
However, the virus continues to spread worldwide, and it is still having 
significant economic impacts. This is particularly the case in sectors that rely 
on individuals being physically close to each other, such as hospitality and 
travel. Looking forward, the course of the pandemic and the steps needed to 
contain it remain highly uncertain.

Key messages
  Following the sharp bounce back in growth that occurred when contain-

ment measures were lifted and the economy reopened, the Canadian 
economy transitioned to a slower, more protracted recuperation phase 
of its recovery. The phases of the recovery are proceeding largely as 
described in the July Report, though the initial rebound was stronger 
than expected. Furthermore, the near-term slowing in the recuperation 
phase is likely to be more pronounced as a result of the recent increase 
of COVID-19 infections.

  There is ongoing and significant slack in the Canadian economy. The gap 
between the actual output and the potential output of the economy is not 
expected to close until 2023. The economy is progressing unevenly, with 
some sectors and workers disproportionately affected by the virus. 

  Ongoing slack in the economy is expected to continue to hold inflation 

down into 2023.  

The economic projection is highly conditional on 
assumptions about COVID-19
The economic recovery remains dependent on the evolution of the pandemic. 
Despite this ongoing uncertainty, the Bank is returning to its usual practice 
of providing a projection for economic growth and inflation in this Monetary 
Policy Report. Needless to say, this projection remains highly conditional 
on the course of the virus and the measures needed to contain it. But, with 
more than six months since the onset of the pandemic, the Bank has gained 
a better understanding of how containment measures and support programs 
affect the Canadian and global economies. This, along with more information 
on medical developments related to COVID-19, allows the Bank to now make 
a reasonable set of assumptions to underpin a base-case forecast.

Given the continued uncertainty about the evolution of the pandemic 
(Chart 1), the projection is highly conditional on the following assumptions:

  Extensive lockdown measures, such as the widespread closures imposed 

early in the pandemic, will not be reintroduced, although more localized 
and moderate containment measures will ebb and flow.

  Vaccines and effective treatments will be widely available by mid-2022, 

at which time the direct effects of the pandemic on economic activity will 
have ended. Precautionary behaviour of households and the effects from 
the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 are, however, likely to linger.

The pandemic is also likely to have persistent effects on the preferences and 
behaviours of consumers and businesses. This could lead to lasting changes 
to the structure of the economy and could weigh on its potential output. The 
sizes and timing of such effects are difficult to estimate precisely. Given these 
considerations, the outlook for Canadian and global economic activity remains 
unusually uncertain.

Global economy
Global economy

Global economic growth rebounded as economies reopened over the 
summer, but, as expected, the surge in activity has since slowed. By the third 
quarter of 2020, the global economy is estimated to have recovered more 
than half of its initial loss of 10 percent. The reopening stage was more robust 
and more uneven across regions than in the central scenario presented in the 
July Report: advanced economies and China experienced milder contractions 
and stronger rebounds. In contrast, emerging-market economies (EMEs) 
have been hit harder, especially those with severe outbreaks, such as India 
and some Latin American countries. 

Changes in commodity prices reflect the partial and uneven recovery in the 
global economy. Initially, global oil prices rebounded quickly, but they remain 
roughly unchanged since July and are about one-third lower than their pre-
pandemic levels. Meanwhile, non-energy commodity price indexes have more 
than fully recovered. 

Policy plays a key role in the dynamics of the recovery. Income and 
employment were supported by large fiscal policy measures announced at 
the onset of the crisis. Now, however, the expiration of fiscal measures will 
contribute to slowing growth in some economies. 

In the Bank’s projection, global growth slows in the fourth quarter. Several 
factors are contributing to weaker growth in many countries, including 
fading pent-up demand, declining fiscal support and rising numbers of 
COVID-19 cases. During the prolonged recuperation stage of the recovery, 
physical distancing measures and uncertainty about the virus are expected to 
create a persistent drag in most economies through 2022, when the virus is 
assumed to be under control. Global trade has rebounded quickly, reflecting, 
in part, the resilience of global value chains (Box 1). The recovery in global 
goods production and trade should help to limit negative trade spillover 
effects. 

Overall, global gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to contract about 
4 percent in 2020 before growing by 4½ percent on average in 2021 and  
2022 (Table 1). Global growth in 2020 is stronger than expected in the July 
Report. After 2020, it is revised down, reflecting weaker outlooks for EMEs 
and the downward revision to potential output growth in all regions.

COVID-19 will have lasting effects on the world economy (Chart 2). Global 
potential output is expected to be about 2 percent lower by the end of 
2022 compared with its pre-pandemic trend. Factors contributing to this 
decline include costly reallocations of resources, reduced labour force 
attachment, and slower growth in investment and productivity (Appendix 1). 
Persistent excess supply in all regions through 2022 keeps inflation 
pressures subdued.

Box 1

Global value chains adapted quickly to the COVID-19 crisis
The resilience of global value chains (GVCs) has contributed 
to the rebound in global trade and economic activity. The 
onset of the pandemic brought many challenges: broad 
factory shutdowns, surging demand for essential supplies, 
and interrupted transport of components and fi nal goods. 
GVCs were initially aﬀ ected by the se widespread disruptions 

Global trade contracted sharply and has since 

Chart 1-A: 
improved
Year-over-year growth in global trade volume, monthly data

but were able to adjust relatively quickly because they 
are dominated by large fi rms with a diversity of suppliers 
and considerable resources dedicated to managing supply 
chains. For example, with ingenuity and hard work, food 
supply chains were restructured within weeks and the North 
American automobile industry resumed production relatively 
smoothly. Ongoing eﬀ orts are required, however, to avoid 
disruptions to supply chains.1

Fewer trade spillovers have occurred during the 
COVID-19 pandemic than during the global fi nancial crisis. 
Global trade fell sharply in the second quarter but has since 
partially rebounded (Chart 1-A). An important diﬀ erence in 
the current crisis is the higher concentration of economic 
impacts in the services sector. Sectors with strong links to 
international trade, such as manufacturing, are less aﬀ ected. 

Over the longer term, the COVID-19 pandemic may reshape 
GVCs as fi rms take additional measures to make the supply 
chains even more resilient. This may include diversifying 
production locations and suppliers as well as investing more 
in digitalization. The ongoing elevated uncertainty, however, 
weighs on investment decisions, including those of GVC 
fi rms.

Financial conditions remain supportive of growth
Global financial market conditions remain highly accommodative, as central 
banks keep policy rates low and use other tools to provide additional 
stimulus. The US Federal Reserve recently adopted a new flexible average 
inflation targeting framework and restated its accommodative stance. Yields 
for sovereign bonds are near record lows, with most sovereign bonds issued 
by advanced economies trading below 1 percent. Yield curves for North 
American sovereign bonds have steepened slightly, with long-short spreads 
reaching their early-2018 levels. Yields remain anchored at the short end 
by central bank policy rate targets and forward guidance. Meanwhile, long-
term yields have risen, reflecting that investors’ sentiment has improved and 
inflation expectations are slightly higher. Market-based expectations for US 
inflation have increased since July and are mostly back to pre-crisis levels. 

Financing conditions have improved somewhat for non-financial corporations 
and EMEs since July. Corporate spreads have declined further, and North 
American corporate bond issuance has been strong, although it has recently 
slowed. Emerging-market bond spreads are also lower than in July, and 
capital flows are returning to some emerging markets. North American 
equity indexes are up from their mid-July levels, although performance varies 
considerably across sectors, reflecting the unevenness of the recovery. 

The Canadian dollar has strengthened further against the US dollar since 
July amid increased global appetite for risk. Despite oil prices remaining well 
below their pre-pandemic levels, the Canadian dollar has returned to the level 
it was at in late 2019 and early 2020. The US dollar has depreciated since 
July, partly reflecting further declines in real interest rates in the United States 
relative to other countries (Chart 3). Because the economies of emerging 
markets have generally been more negatively affected by the pandemic, their 
currencies, as a group, continue to weaken relative to those of their trading 
partners. By contrast, the euro has strengthened since July.

The US economy rebounded quickly but is now slowing  
US employment and economic activity rebounded quickly after May and 
by more than expected in the July Report. In June, consumption of goods 
surpassed its pre-pandemic levels, with strong demand for home improvement 
items and motor vehicles. Residential construction has also picked up strongly. 
In contrast, services consumption has only partially recovered, and industrial 
production remains below pre-pandemic levels in many sectors (Chart 4).

US fiscal policy has provided important support in 2020. The Bank estimates 
that fiscal stimulus offset about half of the negative economic effects of 
the pandemic by the third quarter. US monetary policy has been highly 
accommodative, and markets expect this to continue over the medium term, 
consistent with the Federal Reserve’s recent guidance.

Incoming data show gains in employment and economic activity have eased 
since July, as the initial surge of demand subsided. US growth is anticipated 
to slow markedly in the fourth quarter as rising numbers of COVID-19 cases 
are prompting renewed caution and some fiscal support measures are set 
to expire. The Bank’s projection assumes no additional fiscal measures 
will be implemented.1 Consumption growth is therefore expected to be 
particularly weak in the autumn and winter, with elevated rates of new 
infections requiring continued physical distancing. Beginning in mid-2021, 

1  Additional fiscal stimulus is an upside risk to the outlook. Bank analysis assumes a total multiplier 

effect from US fiscal policy of 0.8. Relative to the July Report, the multiplier effects are slightly 
higher, based on recent research. See R. Chetty, J. N. Friedman, N. Hendren, M. Stepner and The 
Opportunity Insights Team, “How Did COVID-19 and Stabilization Policies Affect Spending and 
Employment? A New Real-Time Economic Tracker Based on Private Sector Data,” National Bureau 
of Economic Research Working Paper No. 27341 (June 2020); and O. Coibion, Y. Gorodnichenko 
and M. Weber, “Labor Markets During the COVID-19 Crisis: A Preliminary View,” National Bureau of

Last observations: consumption, August 2020;

consumption growth should gradually pick up because the need for these 
measures will likely ease, although consumers are anticipated to remain 
apprehensive throughout the projection horizon. The weak consumption 
outlook and elevated uncertainty slow investment growth. The pandemic is 
also expected to negatively affect US potential output growth (Appendix 1).

Inflation is anticipated to remain below 2 percent through 2022 due to 
persistent excess supply. In recent months, core inflation has been pushed up 
by transitory factors, including higher prices for motor vehicles and parts as 
well as financial services.

A resurgence of COVID-19 is dampening the recovery in 
the euro area 
The euro area economy contracted most among the major economies, with 
output in the second quarter falling to 15 percent below its pre-pandemic 
level. Policy support has preserved jobs effectively despite large declines 
in activity and hours worked. Indicators of production and sentiment in the 
euro area suggest that growth in the third quarter rebounded by somewhat 
more than expected in the July Report. However, the recent resurgence in 
COVID-19 infections has required some renewed containment measures, 
slowing near-term growth.

Looking beyond the near term, the recovery is expected to be prolonged, 
reflecting a persistent need for physical distancing measures. This is somewhat 
offset by policy support, although fiscal support has been moderate so far and 
the scope for further monetary policy action may be limited.2 The pandemic 
is also expected to reduce labour input and total factor productivity growth, 
slowing potential and actual output growth in the euro area. 

2  European Union leaders agreed in July to provide coordinated fiscal stimulus under the Recovery 

and Resilience Facility. This agreement marks an important development; however, details available 
so far suggest it will have a relatively modest impact through 2022.

China’s output has returned to pre-pandemic levels
With the spread of the virus under control there, China’s economic recovery 
has been faster than that of other major economies and than that expected 
in July. China’s GDP returned to its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter. 
Investment in infrastructure and real estate has been especially robust, partly 
due to policy support and strong credit growth. Exports have also increased 
rapidly in recent months. Chinese exporters have benefited from an earlier 
reopening than other economies and from strong foreign demand for medical 
equipment, office items for remote work and high-tech products. Retail 
sales have lagged the recovery in production, although recent data suggest 
consumption and demand for services are gaining momentum.

China’s recovery is expected to broaden further as consumption, private 
sector investment and foreign demand continue to strengthen. Fiscal 
stimulus is offsetting a significant share of the drag on growth from physical 
distancing. As elsewhere, the pandemic’s effects are expected to reduce 
China’s potential output, especially productivity and investment growth. 

Many emerging-market economies continue to struggle
Many EMEs have been hit hard by the virus. India and many Latin 
American countries face particularly severe and ongoing outbreaks that 
are constraining activity, especially in the services sector. In East Asia, 
although the virus is relatively well controlled, recent data suggest that 
caution is keeping economic activity somewhat subdued. 

The recovery in most EMEs is projected to be slower than in China and 
advanced economies. The capacity of many EMEs to shift to remote work 
is limited. Financial vulnerabilities and constraints on their ability to provide 
fiscal policy support are also expected to dampen the recovery in EMEs. 
Physical distancing effects and lower potential output result in downward 
revisions to the outlook from the July Report for oil-importing EMEs. These 
factors weigh on economies in the rest-of-the-world block as well, with low oil 
prices also reducing estimates of their potential output.

Recovery of commodity prices is uneven
Oil prices have been steady in recent weeks as the global recovery slows and 
oil supply gradually increases. Global oil prices remain about one-third lower 
than their pre-pandemic levels (Chart 5). Reductions in air travel and ground 
transportation as well as high oil inventories are contributing to persistently 
low oil prices. 

As in the July Report, the Bank assumes that Brent and West Texas 
Intermediate prices will remain close to US$40 per barrel and Western 
Canadian Select will stay around US$30 per barrel (Box 2). Risks around 
this assumption are tilted modestly to the upside over the medium term 
because oil prices may rise further as the global economy recovers. 

Indexes for non-energy commodity prices are now exceeding their pre-
pandemic levels. The recovery in global manufacturing and China’s 
infrastructure investment growth have bolstered prices for base metals. 
Forestry product prices surged over the summer because earlier cuts to 
production left inventories low while US housing demand strengthened. 
Increased supply and slowing demand growth have since helped stabilize 
lumber prices.

The Canadian economy has now entered the recuperation phase of the 
recovery. As anticipated, rapid economic growth from easing containment 
measures over the summer has transitioned to a more moderate pace. The 
recent reintroduction of some containment measures in response to rising 
numbers of COVID-19 cases is expected to have a negative impact on 
economic activity in the near term.

The economic effects of the pandemic have been highly uneven. Some activity 
has been relatively unaffected, or even boosted, by the virus and containment 
measures. In other cases, businesses were partially or fully shut down but have 
been able to reopen, with activity returning close to pre-pandemic levels. In 
contrast, businesses in sectors that require close physical contact continue 
to be disproportionately affected (Chart 6). The effects have been similarly 
uneven across households.

Key inputs to the projection
The Bank of Canada’s projection is always conditional on 
several key assumptions, and changes to them will aﬀ ect 
the outlook for the Canadian economy. In addition to the 
assumptions about the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic 
and public health measures described in the Overview 
section, the key inputs into the Bank’s projection are as 
follows:

•  Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent levels. The 
per-barrel prices in US dollars are assumed to be $40 for 
Brent and West Texas Intermediate and $30 for Western 
Canadian Select, about the same as assumed in the July 
Report.

•  By convention, the Bank does not forecast the exchange 

rate in the Monetary Policy Report. The Canadian dollar 
is assumed to remain at 76 cents US over the projection 
horizon, close to its recent average and somewhat above 
the 74 cents US assumed in the July Report.

•  The pandemic and related containment measures 

have persistent and temporary negative eﬀ ects on the 
Canadian economy.1 

•  The Bank’s assessment of the growth of potential 
output, a longer-term concept, looks through the 
short-lived impacts of containment measures. 
The Bank estimates that over 2020–23, persistent 
scarring eﬀ ects of the pandemic on the labour force, 

1  As in the July Report, the Bank makes the distinction between supply and 

potential output in the near term to account for the relatively short-lived 
nature of some of the contraction in supply.

investment and the structure of the economy will 
lower potential output growth considerably, relative to 
previous assessments (Appendix 1 on page 29). The 
midpoints of the latest estimated ranges for potential 
output growth average about 1 percent per year over 
2020–23. These estimates are subject to greater 
uncertainty than usual.

•  Containment measures implemented by governments 
are having important short-term eﬀ ects on the supply 
of goods and services. In particular, supply fell sharply 
earlier this year when some fi rms were forced to 
temporarily suspend or curtail operations. The eﬀ ect 
on supply is expected to largely dissipate over 2021. 

•  Estimates of supply can be obtained by combining 

the estimates of the temporary eﬀ ects of the 
containment measures with the estimates of potential 
output. The Bank estimates that the output gap—the 
diﬀ erence between supply and GDP—was roughly 
-3 to -4 percent in the third quarter. 

•  The neutral nominal policy rate is defi ned as the real 
rate consistent with output remaining sustainably at 
its potential and with infl ation at target, on an ongoing 
basis, plus 2 percent for infl ation. It is a medium- to 
long-term equilibrium concept. In this Report, the Bank 
has updated its estimated range of the neutral interest 
rate (see Appendix 2 on page 33). The projection is based 
on the assumption that the neutral rate is at the midpoint 
of this range of 1.75 to 2.75 percent.

Recognizing the ongoing challenges—particularly the severe impacts 
on low-income households—governments have extended and modified 
income support programs since the July Report. Meanwhile, monetary 
policy continues to keep borrowing costs low for Canadian businesses and 
households (Box 3 on page 24).

The economic recovery is projected to be prolonged, underpinned by 
policy support but largely influenced by the evolution of the virus, ongoing 
uncertainty and structural changes to the economy. These changes could 
result in longer-term shifts of workers and capital across different regions 
and sectors of the economy. This adjustment process weighs on the Bank’s 
estimates of potential growth.

After declining by about 5 ½ percent in 2020, the economy is expected to 
expand by almost 4 percent on average in 2021 and 2022 (Table 2). Two 
factors will likely lead to quarterly patterns of growth that are unusually 
choppy: localized outbreaks and containment measures, and varied rates of 
recovery across industries.

Inflation is expected to remain below the lower end of the Bank’s inflation-
control target range of 1 to 3 percent until early 2021, largely due to the 
effects of low energy prices. Subsequently, inflation is anticipated to be within 
the target range, but economic slack will continue to put downward pressure 
on inflation throughout the projection period.

The reopening phase was strong but uneven
Growth is estimated to have rebounded strongly in the third quarter, reversing 
about two-thirds of the decline observed in the first half of the year (Table 3). 
A sizable bounce back in activity resulted from a rebound in foreign demand, 
the release of pent-up demand for housing and some durable goods, and 
robust policy support.

Housing activity recovered sharply in the third quarter, supported by 
historically low financing costs, resilient incomes for higher-earning 
households, and extra sales and construction that made up for delayed spring 
activity (Chart 7). By September, cumulative resales are estimated to have 
compensated for the activity that was missed during the normally busy spring 
market. Housing activity may also be benefiting from changes in preferences. 
In particular, more than one-quarter of respondents to the Canadian Survey 
of Consumer Expectations in the third quarter of 2020 reported they would 
like to move to a larger or single-family home because of the pandemic.

The strength of the housing market recovery, combined with a tight resale 
market, has led to rapid growth of house prices in some markets. In contrast 
to the appreciation of house values observed in Toronto and Vancouver in 
2016, price growth has been strongest in markets with moderate loan- 
to-income ratios, such as Ottawa, Montréal and Halifax.

Households have been adapting to an environment with physical distancing 
measures. Consumers are spending less on services that involve higher risks 
of infection, such as travel, personal care services and recreation. At the 
same time, they are spending relatively more on goods such as groceries and 
electronics (Chart 8). As a result, sales of most goods are estimated to have 
recovered in the third quarter to near pre-pandemic levels.

fi gures were -8.2 for 2020Q 1, -43.0 for 2020Q2 and 31.3 for 2020Q3. For longer horizons, fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter percentage changes are presented. 

Saving and spending patterns have diverged across households. Some 
lower-income workers who lost their jobs are receiving support payments 
that exceed their pre-pandemic income levels, permitting them to increase 
their savings. For other laid-off workers, support payments fall well short of 
pre-pandemic incomes. Meanwhile, higher-income households have been 
less affected by job losses but have curtailed their typical spending, mainly 
on services that require a greater degree of in-person interaction. The overall 
savings rate has risen significantly.

Investment and exports have not had as strong a recovery as household 
spending. Both have rebounded from their lows in the second quarter 
but remain subdued, with significant weakness in some sectors. Some 
non-commodity exports, such as motor vehicles and parts as well as 
consumer goods, have recovered quickly. In contrast, exports of industrial 
machinery and equipment and other capital goods have lagged. Energy 
exports remain weak amid low oil prices, soft demand and ongoing structural 
challenges in the industry.

The Bank estimates that economic growth will be very modest in the fourth 
quarter (Table 3). The immediate boost to growth from the reopening of 
businesses and pent-up demand is seen as having largely occurred over 
the summer. In addition, the reintroduction of some containment measures 
in several provinces and the adverse effects on confidence stemming from 
the recent rise in the number of cases of COVID-19 are expected to further 
dampen fourth-quarter growth.

In summary, the rebound in activity occurred sooner and growth was stronger 
than expected in the July Report. The upward revision to estimated growth 
in the third quarter was driven by housing, consumption and exports. This 
revision is larger than the downward revision in the fourth quarter, so the 
estimated level of real activity at the end of the year is around 3 percent 
higher than in the central scenario of the July Report.

Substantial excess capacity remains
Labour markets have improved significantly since the economy reopened. 
However, about 720,000 people were still out of work in September because 
of pandemic-related job losses—substantially more than the peak level of 
job losses during the 2008–09 recession. Employment continued its strong 
recovery through the third quarter, although the pace of job gains is expected 
to slow considerably in the coming months as growth wanes.

The impact of the COVID-19 crisis continues to be highly uneven across firms 
and workers. Recovery in the hardest-hit sectors—including accommodation 
and food services, recreation, and travel—continues to lag. Workers in these 
sectors continue to face elevated levels of unemployment (Chart 9). Overall, 
payments under the Canada Emergency Response Benefit program have 
offset income losses for those in the lowest income quartile (Chart 10). Youth 
and low-wage workers continue to be disproportionately affected, while

unevenness across other groups has diminished in recent months. However, 
the breadth and intensity of re-imposed containment measures, including 
impacts on schools and the availability of child care, could lead to setbacks. 
Long breaks in employment have the potential for longer-term impacts on the 
income prospects of vulnerable groups.

In the autumn 2020 Business Outlook Survey (BOS), a majority of firms 
reported that labour and capacity pressures remained subdued, consistent 
with other indicators of material excess capacity. Some firms, however, noted 
shortages for specific types of labour or disruptions to the supply chain for 
particular goods as a result of the pandemic. Firms surveyed in the BOS 
indicated that they expect price and wage pressures to remain muted over 
the coming year.

Overall, the large gap between supply and demand that opened with the onset 
of the pandemic is estimated to have significantly narrowed in the third quarter, 
as the economy rebounded. Nonetheless, considerable economic slack remains. 
The Bank estimates that the output gap was between −3 and −4 percent in the 
third quarter of 2020.

CPI inflation is weak amid divergent price pressures
At 0.5 percent in September, consumer price index (CPI) inflation remains 
well below the Bank’s target range, as anticipated in the July Report. Prices 
for CPI components that fell sharply because of weak demand early in 
the pandemic, including gasoline and travel accommodations, remain low 
compared with their levels from a year ago. Meanwhile, prices for products 
that saw a surge in demand early in the pandemic have started easing (for 
example, household cleaning and paper products). As a result, overall price 
pressures remain subdued. An adjusted price index, which accounts for the 
dramatic changes in the consumption patterns of Canadians since the start 
of the pandemic, is increasing at a rate that is only slightly higher than CPI 
inflation (Chart 11).3

Measures of core inflation have been below 2 percent, consistent with an 
economy where demand has fallen by more than supply, implying economic 
slack. Core inflation measures, which are designed to capture broad 
inflationary pressures, have declined by less than CPI inflation. The low rate 
of CPI inflation is being driven by large declines in prices for a small number 
of items that together have significant weight in the CPI basket.

3  The construction of the adjusted price index is described in the July Report. It captures changes 

in spending patterns of Canadians since the start of the pandemic. For more details, see K. Huynh, 
H. Lao, P. Sabourin and A. Welte, “What Do High-Frequency Expenditure Network Data Reveal 
About Spending and Inflation During COVID-19?” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2020-20

Potential output growth is revised down sharply
In this Report, the Bank provides its reassessment of potential output 
growth. The outlook for potential output is considerably weaker than in the 
April 2019 Report (Box 2 and Appendix 1). Factors related to the pandemic 
explain most of the revisions. Containment measures also have temporary 
effects on supply—lowering the growth of supply relative to potential in 
2020 and boosting it in 2021.

Even without the temporary effects from containment measures, potential 
output growth is estimated to be lower than in the April 2019 Report. The 
downward revision reflects long-lasting effects from the pandemic. Slower 
capital accumulation is expected to weigh on trend labour productivity 
growth for years to come. In addition, some laid-off workers may exit the 
labour market if they are unable to find new jobs, putting downward pressure 
on trend labour input growth. As a result, potential output growth is estimated 
to average 1.2 percent over 2022 and 2023, much lower than the estimated 
average growth of 1.8 percent over 2010–18.

As usual, the Bank’s assessment of potential output is subject to consider-
able uncertainty, and estimates are presented as a range (Table 2). The 
degree of uncertainty has been magnified by the pandemic.

The recuperation phase sets in
Growth is expected to average close to 4 percent over 2021 and 2022 as 
the economy recuperates (Chart 12). This implies that GDP does not return 
to its pre-pandemic level until the start of 2022, and the output gap is not 
closed until considerably later. The recovery is expected to continue to be 
uneven: activity in some sectors remains largely unaffected by the pandemic 
or containment measures, while other sectors struggle and face a prolonged

recovery. For these sectors, uncertainty and its drag on growth are expected 
to persist but steadily diminish over time. The recovery will remain uneven and 
only partial until the pandemic is over (Chart 13). 

The Bank anticipates that fiscal policy will continue to provide important 
support to the economy throughout the recovery. In light of recent federal 
and provincial announcements, the projection incorporates additional fiscal 
support relative to the July Report. The new fiscal measures, including 
broadened eligibility for employment insurance and new benefit programs, 
have strengthened the outlook for disposable income. The impact of fiscal 
stimulus on GDP is strongest in 2020 and early 2021. In contrast, there are 
longer lags in the monetary transmission mechanism, so the impacts of the 
monetary policy actions that have been taken are expected to continue 
to build.

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONetAry POliCy rePOrt  •  OCtOBer 2020

Household spending leads the recovery
The overall outlook for consumption and housing is being driven by 
employment and disposable income, pandemic-induced changes in behaviour, 
and uncertainty. In addition, low interest rates are expected to support 
spending, especially on residential investment and durable goods, such as 
motor vehicles.

Consumption and housing demand, as well as potential output, are supported 
over the projection horizon by resumed immigration. The pace of arrivals in 
Canada is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2021. However, the 
assumption for the future path of the total population has been revised lower 
as a result of the pandemic.

Consumption growth is anticipated to remain around 4 percent over the 
projection horizon. Over this period, two factors weighing on consumption 
should gradually become less important. The first is physical distancing, 
which restricts spending on services such as travel, hospitality and personal 
care. The second is uncertainty, which is increasing precautionary savings 
(Chart 14). These factors contributed to an unusually large jump in the 
savings rate in 2020. As the effects of these factors diminish, household 
spending should increase.

Overall, the outlook for residential investment reflects the implications 
of pandemic-related shifts in housing preferences, lower population and 
decreased borrowing costs. As pent-up demand recedes, home resales are 
expected to moderate in 2021 from record levels in the second half of 2020. 
Renovations should remain resilient over the projection horizon, with people 
spending more time at home.

Exports recover slowly
Exports return to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2022 in the projection, 
underpinned by a gradual improvement in foreign demand (Chart 15). Low 
energy prices restrain growth of energy exports, and travel exports will 
continue to be subdued until international tourism resumes.

The recovery in imports is also expected to be gradual. Imports of machinery 
and equipment are anticipated to be weak as uncertainty hampers 
investment by Canadian firms. At the same time, imports of consumer goods 
are expected to recover along with consumer demand. Imports of services 
should begin to recover when borders gradually reopen.

The recovery in business investment will be protracted 
Business investment is expected to increase gradually, in line with soft 
domestic and foreign demand. Uncertainty is expected to remain a significant 
drag on firms’ investment decisions. In particular, firms face considerable 
uncertainty about the long-term nature of some of the changes in business 
practices and in household preferences and behaviours resulting from the 
pandemic. Some shifts may persist, while others could revert relatively 
quickly once conditions begin to normalize. For example, the planned return 
of workers to centralized offices remains unclear, which creates significant 
uncertainty for firms’ investments in buildings and facilities.

Investment outside the oil and gas sector is held back by subdued business 
sentiment. As a result, investment does not surpass its pre-pandemic level 
until mid-2022 (Chart 16). 

Investment in the oil and gas sector is even more challenged because of 
low oil prices and difficult financing conditions, and it is not expected to 
return to pre-pandemic levels over the projection horizon. As a result, capital 
expenditure plans and oil production in Canada remain significantly below 
2019 levels throughout the projection horizon. Following a roughly 30 percent

contraction in 2020, oil and gas investment is projected to grow by just over 
2 percent in 2021–22. While risks to the oil price assumption are skewed 
to the upside, modestly higher prices are unlikely to lead to a significant 
increase in investment.

Inventory investment is expected to contribute positively to growth over the 
projection horizon as firms rebuild depleted stocks.

Economic slack weighs on inflation
In the projection, the path for CPI inflation over the next year largely 
reflects the dynamics of energy prices and the gradual narrowing of excess 
capacity. The dramatic decline in gasoline prices in March and April will hold 
inflation down until early 2021. After that, CPI inflation is expected to pick 
up. Nevertheless, looking through quarter-to-quarter volatility, CPI inflation 
is expected to be below target in 2021 and 2022 as a result of ongoing 
slack (Chart 17). For example, about one-quarter of the jobs lost during 
the containment have yet to return. With some sectors unable to reopen 
completely until the virus has passed, excess supply is expected to exert 
downward pressure on inflation over the entire projection horizon.

Other factors could lead to movements in inflation. Higher operating costs 
from physical distancing measures, such as increased sanitation procedures 
or additional staff, could be a source of upward price pressures (for example, 
the “COVID-19 fees” seen in some hair salons).

Medium- and long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 
the 2 percent target. Most firms responding to the autumn 2020 Business 
Outlook Survey anticipate that inflation will remain within the Bank’s inflation-
control target range of 1 to 3 percent over the next two years. Expectations 
for inflation two years from now remain relatively stable and close to levels

observed before the pandemic. Most respondents to the Canadian Survey 
of Consumer Expectations in the third quarter of 2020 anticipate that 
inflation will be within that range or just above it over the next two years.4 
The September 2020 Consensus Economics forecast for Canadian CPI 
inflation is 0.7 percent in 2020 and 1.7 percent in 2021. Responses to a 
quarterly question on long-term inflation expectations show an average of 
2.0 percent through 2030.

Box 3

The evolution of the Bank of Canada’s balance sheet
The Bank of Canada responded quickly in the initial stages of 
the pandemic by:

• 

• 

lowering its policy interest rate to its eﬀ ective lower 
bound of 25 basis points, and 

introducing several liquidity facilities and asset purchase 
programs to restore market functioning. 

As a result, the Bank’s balance sheet expanded rapidly, 
refl ecting predominantly the growth of holdings of term 
repos and bankers’ acceptances (BAs). This occurred as 
other major central banks dramatically increased their 
balance sheets at the onset of the pandemic, though the 
Bank of Canada’s increase was somewhat more pronounced 
(Chart 3-A, left panel). Total Bank holdings, however, remain 
much lower than those for most other central banks of 
advanced economies.

Financial market conditions improved with the Bank’s actions, 
and market participants are no longer making much use 
of the facilities and programs for liquidity purposes. As a 
result, the Bank has discontinued some of these facilities and 

programs and scaled back others.1 This, and the maturing 
of $41 billion of BAs and term repos, has contributed to 
stabilizing the size of the balance sheet since July (Chart 3-B, 
left panel). 

It is also worth noting that the maturity structure of the 
Bank’s holdings of domestic federal government debt is 
considerably shorter than that of some other central banks, 
including the US Federal Reserve (Chart 3-A, right panel).2 
This diﬀ erent maturity profi le partly refl ects the fact that the 
Bank of Canada introduced its fi rst quantitative easing (QE) 
program during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas many 
other central banks have implemented QE programs to 
provide monetary stimulus at various points since the global 

1  On October 15, 2020, the Bank announced that the Bankers’ Acceptance 

Purchase Facility (BAPF) and the Canada Mortgage Bond Purchase Program 
(CMBP) would be discontinued, with the last operations scheduled to take place 
before the end of October. The Bank also announced that it would reduce the 
frequency of term repo operations and narrow the list of eligible securities.
In Chart 3-A, US Federal Reserve holdings exclude agency mortgage-backed 
securities. If they were included, the maturity structure of the US Federal 
Reserve would be even longer.

fi nancial crisis. The Bank of Canada therefore had a smaller 
balance sheet than other central banks at the beginning of 
the pandemic. Because the initial focus of the Government 
Bond Purchase Program (GBPP) was on restoring market 
functioning, more purchases were allocated to bonds 
with shorter maturities where issuance was largest. This 
contributed to the shorter-maturity distribution of Bank of 
Canada holdings.

With the economy reopening in the summer and market 
functioning much improved, the Bank shifted the primary 
focus of its GBPP to providing monetary stimulus. As of 
mid-October, the Bank held about 34 percent of outstanding 
Government of Canada (GoC) bonds. The maturity structure 
of the balance sheet has lengthened somewhat as a result of 
the ongoing purchases of bonds and the maturing of shorter-
term holdings (Chart 3-B, right panel). 

For monetary stimulus purposes, both the size of QE 
purchases and the maturity composition of purchases can 
have a meaningful impact on compressing yields. The 

maturity composition of the GBPP has been roughly 
consistent with the maturity distribution of outstanding 
GoC bonds. This implies that these purchases have been 
concentrated in the shorter-term maturities. About half of 
purchases have been bonds with terms to maturity of less 
than three years. 

QE purchases of longer-maturity bonds provide more 
monetary stimulus than purchases of shorter-maturity debt. 
Purchases of longer-maturity bonds have a greater impact, 
dollar-for-dollar spent, by removing more term risk from 
markets and putting downward pressure on term premiums.3 
Lower term premiums imply lower GoC bond yields, all other 
things equal. This lowers the borrowing costs that matter 
most to households and businesses. In particular, fi xed-rate 
household and corporate borrowing tends to be most closely 
linked to 3- to 15-year GoC bond yields, although some 
corporations and utilities borrow at longer maturities. 

3  Term premiums are premiums that borrowers pay to lock in interest rates for 
longer terms. They compensate lenders for the risk of loss in value if market 
interest rates were to rise before the debt matures.

risks to the inflation outlook
risks to the inflation outlook

The uncertainty around the projection remains extraordinarily high, given 
that the projection is conditional on the evolution and size of the economic 
impacts of the pandemic. The outlook could be significantly different if 
COVID-19 infection rates and containment measures are more or less 
favourable than assumed in this Report. The economic outlook would be 
stronger if the pandemic were to end before mid-2022. This would be the 
case if, for example, effective vaccines were to become widely available 
earlier than expected. The drag on economic growth from physical distancing 
and reduced confidence would dissipate more rapidly, boosting household 
spending and business investment. Long-term scarring effects on investment 
and labour would also be smaller.

In contrast, the pandemic and related economic impacts could be more 
severe than anticipated. In the projection, COVID-19 outbreaks are assumed 
to be reasonably well managed through local and targeted containment 
measures. There is a serious risk, however, that broader or more intensive 
restrictions could be required.  

There is also considerable uncertainty about the long-term impacts of 
the pandemic. The more serious the pandemic, the larger the associated 
restructuring and reallocation of resources.

Even if the course of the pandemic proceeds as assumed in the base-case 
projection, the Bank sees a number of upside and downside risks to the 
outlook for inflation. The risks to the economic outlook and inflation are 
viewed as roughly balanced. Downside risks pose a greater concern because 
inflation is currently low and the policy rate is at the effective lower bound. 
Some of the more important risks are listed below.

(i)  Additional fiscal stimulus in the United States (↑)

US growth could be materially stronger than in the base-case 
projection. Authorities may reach an agreement to enact substantial 
additional fiscal stimulus measures. Stronger growth in the United 
States would provide further support to Canadian export growth and 
investment activity.

(ii)  Stronger household spending in Canada (↑)

Household savings have increased dramatically since the pandemic 
began. This has reflected more limited opportunities to spend, 
particularly for higher-income households, as well as increased 
precautionary savings. If more of these savings are spent, consumption 
and residential investment could be stronger than anticipated in the 
projection, and the savings rate could decline more quickly than

expected. For example, households could become less cautious about 
their spending or more confident about economic conditions, even in 
the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment.

(iii)  Sharp tightening of global financial conditions (↓)

Important financial vulnerabilities remain in many countries due to 
elevated debt levels and the high degree of economic uncertainty. 
Worsening pandemic conditions and economic setbacks could lead to 
increased risk premiums and sharply tighter financial conditions. This 
could be particularly severe for EMEs and have broader spillovers. 

(iv)  Rising household and corporate financial stress (↓)

In Canada, slower growth and tighter financial conditions, combined 
with high levels of household and corporate indebtedness, could lead 
to rising numbers of insolvencies and bankruptcies. This, in turn, could 
lead to losses in the financial system, a tightening in credit conditions 
and a reduction in bank lending. This would create a new headwind to 
growth.

Appendix 1: Potential output
Appendix 1: Potential output

The Bank’s estimates of potential output growth in Canada and globally have 
been revised down significantly relative to the estimates presented in the 
April 2019 Report (Table A1‑1 and Table A1‑2). The COVID-19 pandemic has 
lowered potential output growth by affecting its underlying determinants. 
Canada has seen sharp reductions in labour market participation, disruptions 
to immigration and decreases in capital accumulation. This appendix focuses 
on the scarring effects of the pandemic that are likely to persist: 

  weaker business investment, and 

  reduced labour force participation.

Potential output is weaker around the world
Global potential output growth is estimated to have decreased sharply since 
the onset of the pandemic, from 3.3 percent in 2019 to just over 2 percent 
in 2020 (Chart A1‑1 and Table A1‑1).5 This reflects declines in trend labour 
productivity growth in all regions and sharp falls in trend labour input growth 
in advanced economies. The negative effects of the COVID-19 crisis add to 
the ongoing headwinds from population aging, trade tensions and structurally 
low productivity growth.

Global potential output growth is expected to rebound to 2.4 percent in 
2021 and 2.7 percent in 2022. This growth will be driven by a gradual  
recovery in productivity growth in all regions and improved labour force 
dynamics in advanced economies. Relative to the Bank’s April 2019  
estimates, global potential output growth has been revised down by 
1.2 and 0.9 percentage points in 2020 and 2021, respectively. These 
revisions reflect primarily the negative effects of COVID‑19.

In the United States, potential output growth fell from 1.8 percent in 2019 to 
1.1 percent in 2020. This is due largely to a steep decline in trend labour input 
growth because the pandemic has reduced trend labour force participation 
and immigration. Trend labour productivity has also slowed because of 
work disruptions, reduced firm entry and a weaker trajectory for business 
investment. US potential growth is expected to remain weak in 2021 and to 
partially recover to 1.5 percent in 2022 as immigration flows regain some 
momentum, less‑productive firms exit and more‑productive firms expand. 

In EMEs, the largest source of decline in potential output growth is the 
pandemic’s negative effects on capital deepening and on the trend in total 
factor productivity growth. Potential output growth in economies in the rest‑
of‑the‑world block has been revised down in response to similar adverse 
impacts of the pandemic as well as low oil prices, which hurt oil exporters.

Weakness in investment and the labour market weighs 
on Canadian potential
The outlook for potential output in Canada is also much weaker because 
of the pandemic. Considering only the permanent effects on the economy, 
the Bank now expects potential output growth to be 0.8 percentage 
points lower on average over 2020 and through 2023, compared with the 
2020 to 2022 average from the April 2019 assessment (Table A1-2). The

level of potential output is expected to be about 3 percent lower by the end 
of 2022 relative to the Bank’s April 2019 assessment.6 The pandemic also 
has temporary effects on supply. Incorporating these effects would reduce 
estimates of potential growth in 2020 and increase them in 2021 (Table A1‑1).

The biggest source of negative revision is a weaker outlook for business 
investment. Potential skills mismatch and the need to reallocate resources 
across sectors are also expected to play a role. In contrast, even though 
the pandemic has reduced immigration, strong inflows of non-permanent 
residents since 2015 have increased the population profile overall. This, in 
turn, boosts estimated potential output.7

Considering only the permanent effects of the pandemic, the Bank expects 
potential output to grow on average by about 1 percent over 2020 and 
through 2023 (Table A1‑2). Both trend labour input and trend labour 
productivity growth are expected to slow relative to their 2010–18 average. 
Slower capital accumulation explains the reduced growth of trend labour 
productivity. The main factors weighing on trend labour input growth are 
the scarring effects from the pandemic and the secular decline in the 
employment rate associated with an aging population.

Potential output is normally difficult to estimate precisely because its 
components are unobserved and hard to forecast. The uncertainty this 
time is even higher given the unknown course of the pandemic and its large 
economic effects. To help capture uncertainty, the Bank provides a range 
constructed around midpoint estimates, which are subject to both upside and 
downside risks. The most important risks are related to the evolution of the 
COVID-19 pandemic:

  If the pandemic were to end much sooner than expected, business 

investment could rebound sharply as demand picks up and the economy 
returns to normal more quickly. Moreover, most of the persistent drag on 
trend labour input and trend total factor productivity from the pandemic 
would disappear.

  In contrast, if the number of COVID-19 cases were to increase sharply 

in the coming quarters and parts of the economy returned to lockdown, 
potential output growth could be even weaker. In that case, population 
inflows could be even more restricted and business investment could 
remain more subdued for an extended period.

Canada: 2020 Reassessment,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2020-25 (October 2020).

Neutral rate of interest
Neutral rate of interest

The nominal neutral policy rate is the sum of two components:

  the real rate needed to maintain economic output at its potential level and 

inflation at target after the effects of all cyclical shocks to the economy 
have dissipated, and

  2 percent to account for the rate of inflation at target.

The Bank estimates that the nominal neutral rate in Canada currently 
lies in a range of 1.75 to 2.75 percent, 50 basis points lower than in the 
April 2019 update. The assessment was reached using a suite of four 
distinct but complementary approaches used in previous assessments. 
This update includes special emphasis on how the approaches capture the 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.8 Results are summarized in Table A2‑1.

A combination of domestic and global factors accounts for the decline in the 
nominal neutral rate. Domestic factors include a higher perceived level of 
macroeconomic risk (which boosts savings) and a significant decline in the 
projected rate of potential output growth.9

Because Canada is a small open economy, its neutral rate is also closely 
linked to global factors. The Bank continues to use an estimate of the US 
neutral rate as a proxy for the global rate. The Bank currently estimates that 
the US nominal neutral rate lies in a range of 1.75 to 2.75 percent—50 basis 
points lower than in the April 2019 update. The downward revision reflects the 
assessment that upward pressure from greater government debt issuance is

being more than offset by the combined negative effects of weaker potential 
growth, higher inequality and stronger demand for safe assets denominated 
in US dollars.10

As in previous assessments of the neutral rate, the ranges for both the 
Canadian and the global rates are methodological—constructed by aggregat- 
ing the most likely ranges derived from different approaches. While these 
ranges capture the sensitivity of the estimates to different values for key 
parameters and other inputs, they do not capture all sources of uncertainty. 
Given that the pandemic is still unfolding, this year’s estimates for the neutral 
rate are more likely than usual to face revisions as more is learned about the 
medium- and longer-term economic impacts of COVID-19.

REPORT

Canada’s Inﬂ ation-Control Strategy1

Infl ation targeting and the economy
• The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to pro-
mote the economic and fi nancial well-being of Canadians .

• Canada’s experience with infl ation targeting since 1991
has shown that the best way to foster confi dence in the
value of money and to contribute to sustained economic
growth, employment gains and improved living standards
is by keeping infl ation low, stable and predictable . 

• In 2011, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed

Canada’s infl ation-control target for a further fi ve-year
period, ending 31 December 2016 . The target, as measured
by the total consumer price index (CPI), remains at the
2 per cent midpoint of the control range of 1 to 3 per cent .

The monetary policy instrument
• The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes
in the target overnight rate of interest .2 These changes
are transmitted to the economy through their infl uence
on market interest rates, domestic asset prices and the
exchange rate, which aff ect total demand for Canadian
goods and services . The balance between this demand
and the economy’s production capacity is, over time, the
primary determinant of infl ation pressures in the economy .

• Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to
eight quarters—to work their way through the economy
and have their full eff ect on infl ation . For this reason,
monetary policy must be forward-looking . 

• Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent

communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspec-
tive on the forces at work on the economy and their

implications for infl ation . The Monetary Policy Report is a 
key element of this approach . Policy decisions are typi-
cally announced on eight pre-set days during the year, 
and full updates of the Bank’s outlook, including risks to 
the projection, are published four times per year in the 
Monetary Policy Report .

Infl ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible
• Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which
means that the Bank is equally concerned about infl ation
rising above or falling below the 2 per cent target .
• Canada’s infl ation-targeting framework is ﬂ exible . 

Typically, the Bank seeks to return infl ation to target over
a horizon of six to eight quarters . However, the most
appropriate horizon for returning infl ation to target will
vary depending on the nature and persistence of the
shocks buff eting the economy .

Monitoring infl ation
• In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is
caused by fl uctuations in the prices of certain volatile
components (e .g ., fruit and gasoline) and by changes in
indirect taxes . For this reason, the Bank also monitors a
set of “core” infl ation measures, for example, the CPIX,
which strips out eight of the most volatile CPI compo-
nents and the eff ect of indirect taxes on the remaining
components . These “core” measures allow the Bank to
“look through” temporary price movements and focus on
the underlying trend of infl ation . In this sense, core infl a-
tion is monitored as an operational guide to help the Bank
achieve the total CPI infl ation target . It is not a replace-
ment for it .

1  See Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inﬂ ation-Control Target (8 November 2011) and

Renewal of the Inﬂ ation-Control Target: Background Information—November 2011, which are both available on the Bank’s website .

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide 

 additional monetary stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions . The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates,  available 
on the Bank’s website, describes these measures and the principles guiding their use .

Global Economy

The world economy is expected to gather strength following a weak start to 
2016, particularly in the United States and China. The broad growth profile 
remains consistent with that of the April Monetary Policy Report, although 
the Bank’s projections have been marked down modestly, mainly in view of 
the foreseeable macroeconomic effects of the UK referendum vote to exit 
from the European Union (EU) (Brexit). Overall, global economic growth is 
expected to rise from about 3 per cent this year to 3 1/2 per cent in 2017–18 
(Table 1). Considerable uncertainty surrounds the Brexit process, however, 
as well as its outcome and the broader political ramifications. This uncer-
tainty is likely to weigh on the decisions of businesses and households for 
some time to come (Box 1).

Financial conditions remain accommodative
The result of the UK referendum triggered a sharp but orderly repricing of 
a number of asset classes in global financial markets. Safe-haven flows 
contributed to exchange rate movements, notably an appreciation of the US 
dollar and the yen against the pound and the euro. Yields on highly rated 
government bonds fell to record lows as a result of the flight to safety, as 
well as on expectations that central bank actions will lead to a longer period 
of accommodative monetary policy. The global financial system remained

Box 1

The Impact of the UK Vote to Leave the European Union
The impact of the vote by the United Kingdom to exit the 
European Union (Brexit) is expected to be felt primarily 
within those regions, with some spillovers to the rest of the 
global economy . There are three main transmission chan-
nels for the shock: 
•  Financial conditions: While the vote immediately trig-

gered signifi cant exchange rate movements and a sharp 
repricing of a number of asset classes, the global fi nan-
cial system proved to be resilient . This resilience has lim-
ited the negative eff ect on the global economy through 
fi nancial channels . Interest rates have been generally 
lower since the vote, refl ecting, in part, safe-haven fl ows 
to high-quality assets as well as market expectations of 
a more prolonged period of accommodative monetary 
policy . The vote has raised concerns, however, over the 
impact on the business models of European and UK 
banks and other fi nancial institutions .

•  Trade: Brexit may have signifi cant medium-term impli-
cations for trade and investment fl ows for the UK and 
remaining EU countries, although the short-run eff ects 
could be limited . There will likely be prolonged uncer-
tainty, however, about the timing of the UK’s exit and its 
subsequent trade relations with the EU, as well as about 
other issues such as migration .

•  Conﬁ dence : The prolonged uncertainty—compounded 
by the complexity of the negotiations and various polit-
ical challenges—is already weighing on confi dence and 
will likely lead to a postponement of major economic 

decisions, especially on business investment . These 
confi dence eff ects, while concentrated in the UK and the 
EU, may extend to other parts of the world, including the 
United States and Canada .

Assessing all of these eff ects is particularly challenging, 
since many important elements will be understood only 
as the process unfolds . In our current judgment, the level 
of global GDP would be reduced by about 0 .2 per cent by 
the end of 2018 . This modest estimated eff ect refl ects the 
UK’s small share of both global GDP (2 .4 per cent) and 
imports (3 .7 per cent) . It also assumes that the outcome is 
an orderly exit and does not capture possible wider rami-
fi cations, including those in the political sphere . As such, 
most of the eff ect on GDP is expected to come from the 
prolonged period of uncertainty around investment . These 
eff ects will take time to be fully assessed (see Risks to the 
Infl ation Outlook on page 17) . 
The impact on the level of Canadian GDP over the pro-
jection period is likewise anticipated to be modest, about 
-0 .1 per cent, refl ecting, among other factors, Canada’s small 
direct trade exposure to the UK (which is a destination for 
only 3 .5 per cent of Canadian exports) . This estimate also 
includes some second-round eff ects through Canada’s 
other trade partners, primarily the US, as well as through 
confi dence and fi nancial channels . These estimated eff ects 
are incorporated into the Bank’s base-case scenario for 
Canada and contribute to the downward adjustment in the 
profi le for Canadian exports and business investment .

resilient: markets continued to function normally, including funding markets, 
with movements largely stabilizing in the days following the referendum. 
Market sentiment remains fragile, however, because of ongoing uncertainty 
about the strength of the global economy.

US growth is showing signs of a rebound
US economic activity in early 2016 expanded at a more modest pace than 
expected, largely indicating a sharper-than-anticipated contraction in 
business investment in the energy sector (Chart 1). Equipment investment 
outside the energy sector also declined unexpectedly, in large part reflecting 
the temporary weakness in global demand. Nonetheless, incoming data 
suggest that growth will rebound: job gains have averaged about 150,000 
over the past three months, a pace consistent with a falling unemployment 
rate; initial claims for unemployment insurance have fallen below pre-crisis 
lows; and both the job openings rate and the growth in the number of estab-
lishments have been trending up (Chart 2).1

US economic growth is expected to average around 2 per cent over the 
projection horizon, with the strong labour market and accommodative mon-
etary policy continuing to support private domestic demand. High levels of 
consumer confidence and healthy employment are expected to boost con-
sumption growth above the growth of disposable income. While uncertainty 
associated with Brexit may weigh on confidence and cloud the outlook for 
business prospects, investment is expected to pick up in the second half 
of 2016 as the drag from energy investment and the strong US dollar dimin-
ishes, domestic demand remains solid and global growth improves.

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLICy REPORT  •  JULy 2016

Growth prospects remain modest in other advanced 
economies, amid headwinds from Brexit 
Growth in the euro area has been marked down beyond 2016 in light of the 
UK referendum result, which is likely to lead to weaker confidence, tighter 
credit conditions and reduced bilateral trade (Box 1). In Japan, authorities 
have announced additional fiscal stimulus, including a delay in a sales tax 
hike in response to ongoing weakness in private demand growth. Both 
the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have continued to 
implement unconventional monetary policy measures to support growth. 
Economic growth in the euro area and Japan is expected to average around 
1 1/2 per cent and less than 1 per cent, respectively, over the projection 
horizon. Growth in both regions continues to be tempered by weak invest-
ment and structural factors, including labour market rigidities. 

Emerging markets are driving global growth, but face 
challenges 
Economic growth in China slowed more sharply in early 2016 than expected 
in April, to around 4.5 per cent (quarter-over-quarter annualized). The slow-
down was primarily the result of weakness in net exports and, to a lesser 
extent, a drag from softer investment in fixed assets in the manufacturing 
sector—in part because of the ongoing restructuring in industries with 
excess capacity, such as steel. However, strong credit growth in the early 
part of the year and additional fiscal stimulus are expected to support 
growth in the second half of 2016. Residential investment has been stronger 
than expected, suggesting more underlying momentum. Growth in China 
is projected to stabilize at around 6 1/2 per cent over the 2016–18 period, 
although rising corporate debt is exacerbating financial vulnerabilities. 

Among other oil-importing emerging-market economies (EMEs), conditions 
in the first half of the year in certain distressed economies (notably Brazil) 
improved by more than expected. Growth in oil-importing EMEs is expected 
to pick up over 2017–18 as progress is made on structural reforms, particu-
larly the removal of regulatory obstacles to growth. This growth profile is 
now expected to be softer than in April, however, especially in light of recent 
increases in oil prices. 

The projection for growth in the rest-of-the-world grouping has been revised 
down significantly since April. In some oil-exporting EMEs, the adjustment 
to low oil prices has been more severe and protracted than previously antici-
pated, notwithstanding the recent increase in oil prices. Growth is expected 
to recover as the adjustment in these economies progresses. 

Oil prices have risen 
There is gathering evidence that the needed supply-demand adjustment 
in the global oil market is progressing (Chart 3). In this context, the upside 
risks to oil prices identified in previous Reports have already partially 
materialized: the price assumption has risen by about US$10 per barrel 
relative to the April Report, although this increase was also partly a result 
of temporary supply disruptions. By convention, the Bank assumes that 
oil prices will remain near their recent average levels: US$50, US$49 and 
US$36 per barrel, respectively, for Brent, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and 
Western Canada Select (WCS). The substantial reductions in investment

since 2014, coupled with rising demand, continue to pose an upside risk to 
prices over the projection horizon, although ongoing cost-cutting initiatives 
and technological advances limit this upside potential. 

The projected stability of the non-energy commodity price index masks 
divergent pressures on component prices. Lumber prices are expected to 
be a source of strength, benefiting from stronger housing markets in the 
United States and China. In contrast, there is the potential for downward 
pressure on base metals prices as several new mining projects come on 
line globally. 

Summary
The projected path of the Bank’s foreign activity measure, which is an indi-
cator of demand for Canadian exports, has been revised down to reflect a 
less-favourable composition of US economic activity, in particular, weaker 
business investment. Growth in the foreign activity measure improves 
starting in the second half of 2016 as a result of the anticipated rebound in 
US business investment.

By convention, the Canadian dollar is assumed to be close to its recent 
average of 77 cents, similar to the assumption of 76 cents in April.

Canadian Economy

The Canadian economy continues to adjust to low commodity prices. The 
reallocation of investment and employment from the resource sector to the 
non-resource sector is progressing. Starting in the second half of 2016, real 
GDP is expected to increase at a rate that exceeds potential growth, driven 
by solid US domestic demand growth and federal infrastructure spending 
and other fiscal measures (Table 2). The outlook for real GDP is also sup-
ported by accommodative monetary and financial conditions and the past 
depreciation of the Canadian dollar. 

While the fundamental elements of the growth projection are similar to those 
presented in April, the forecast for real GDP growth has been revised down. 
Downward revisions to investment and exports more than offset the posi-
tive economic effects of the recent increase in oil prices. The output gap is 
expected to close somewhat later than forecast in April, toward the end of 
2017. The Bank expects inflation to average close to 2 per cent throughout 
2017 as the output gap narrows.

Uneven quarterly economic growth continues
Economic growth has been uneven in recent quarters, fluctuating around 
the rate of potential output growth (Chart 4). This volatility mainly reflects an 
uneven timing of trade flows and household expenditures. Economic activity 
expanded by 2.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2016 but is estimated to have 
contracted by 1.0 per cent in the second quarter. The quarterly variability is 
exacerbated by the economic effects of the devastating wildfires in Alberta, 
which are estimated to have subtracted about 1 percentage point from GDP 
growth in the second quarter (Box 2). A marked rebound is expected in the

The Near-Term Economic Eﬀ ects of the Alberta Wildﬁ res
The devastating wildfi res in the Fort McMurray area of 
Alberta led to the mass evacuation of residents and the tem-
porary shutdown of several major oil sands production facili-
ties from early May through early June . While the timing and 
magnitude of the impact of the wildfi res on economic data 
are still uncertain, the Bank estimates that real GDP growth 
(expressed quarterly at annual rates) in the second quarter 
was reduced by about 1 .1 percentage points (Table 2-A) . This 
estimate incorporates three related assessments . First, oil 
sands production decreased by up to 1 million barrels per day, 
or roughly 40 million barrels in total . Second, local economic 
activity declined signifi cantly: the Regional Municipality of 
Wood Buff alo was closed and its residents evacuated .1 Third, 
roughly 2,400 structures were lost to the wildfi res, and 

hundreds more were deemed uninhabitable because of toxic 
ash . In the third quarter, GDP is expected to rebound as oil 
production is fully restored and rebuilding  eff orts begin .

a. Numbers in parentheses are from the projection in the previous Report. Assumptions for the price of crude

oil are based on a recent average of spot prices.

b. In this table, the Bank has adopted a convention of showing the last quarter of historical data and the 
next three quarters, which are monitored and forecasted, as well as fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter
projections of real GDP growth and infl ation for longer horizons.

third quarter as oil production resumes and the rebuilding effort gets under 
way in the Fort McMurray area. Also contributing to the rebound are the new 
Canada Child Benefit, which lends support to consumption, and a boost 
from government infrastructure spending. Average growth over the second 
and third quarters is estimated to be about 1 1/4 per cent, softer than antici-
pated in the April Report (Table 3). 

Estimates from the Bank’s two measures of economic slack (the structural 
and statistical approaches) point to material excess capacity.2 Similarly, 
firms participating in the Bank’s summer Business Outlook Survey reported 
that pressures on production capacity and the incidence of labour short-
ages continue to be low. Labour market indicators suggest continuing slack. 
For instance, youth participation rates are near their post-recession lows, 
and wage growth remains subdued, particularly in industries that produce 
goods.3 Looking through the temporary weakness associated with the 
Alberta wildfires, the Bank judges that the excess capacity in the economy 
in the second quarter was between about 1 per cent and 2 per cent.4  

Total CPI inflation remains in the lower half of the Bank’s inflation-control 
range. Downward pressure from low consumer energy prices and persistent 
excess capacity are being partially offset by the temporary boost from the 
pass-through of the earlier exchange rate depreciation. Most measures 
of core inflation remain close to 2 per cent but would be lower without the 
effect of exchange rate pass-through. The near-term outlook for inflation has 
been revised up, reflecting firmer-than-assumed oil prices.

As the complex adjustment progresses, growth will pick up
The expansion of activity in the non-resource sector will assert itself as 
the dominant trend in the second half of 2016 as the drag from declining 
investment in the energy sector wanes. Increased foreign demand and fiscal

economic slack can be found at Statistics > Indicators > Indicators of Capacity and Inflation Pressures

approfondi des pressions salariales au Canada,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2016-6 (July 2016).
4  The projection is based on an assumed value for the output gap of -1.7 per cent in the second quarter 

of 2016 (-1.4 per cent excluding the effect of the wildfires), compared with the April assumption of 
-1.0 per cent for the first quarter. The level of potential GDP is estimated to be 0.2 per cent lower in the 
second quarter than projected in the April Report, reflecting downward historical revisions to business 
investment and capital deepening.

spending, as well as the effects of the past depreciation of the Canadian 
dollar, are expected to lift real GDP growth. In addition, monetary and finan-
cial conditions remain accommodative and the yield curve has flattened, in 
line with recent developments in global financial markets.

Real GDP is expected to grow by 1.3 per cent in 2016, 2.2 per cent in 2017 
and 2.1 per cent in 2018 (Table 2 and Table 3). This projection for GDP 
growth is marked down from April. A more subdued investment profile, 
reflecting (in roughly equal parts) a downward revision to historical data 
and heightened caution in the face of uncertain demand prospects, lowers 
the trajectory of both real GDP and potential output. In addition, exports 
have been revised down in response to relatively weaker foreign demand, 
exacerbated by the effects on trade of the UK referendum (Box 1). These 
downward revisions are partially offset by higher oil prices, which result 
in a modest rebound in Canada’s terms of trade and a boost in real gross 
domestic income (GDI) and consumption.

Difficult adjustments are proceeding in the resource sector 
The restructuring of the resource sector in response to low commodity 
prices is proceeding. Firms in the oil and gas sector have significantly 
reduced investment and employment (Chart 5). Capital spending plans 
suggest that the contraction of investment spending in the oil and gas 
sector will be nearly complete by the end of the year, at which time the level 
of investment in that sector will be about 60 per cent below its 2014 level. 
Other aspects of the restructuring, such as the shifting of employment 
opportunities across regions, are likely to continue for some time. 

Oil prices remain below the full-cycle break-even cost for many producers.5 
In particular, prices remain below levels at which new investment projects 
in the oil sands are likely to be profitable, even with the recent increase. 
Nevertheless, oil sands production should continue to increase modestly as 
previously committed projects are completed and come on line.

Growth in non-energy commodity exports is expected to remain subdued. 
Prices for base metals remain low, and excess supply and competitiveness 
challenges will persist in dampening production and investment spending in 
the sector. At the same time, conditions are more favourable for some other 
non-energy commodities: exports of building materials should continue to 
strengthen as the US housing market keeps on expanding, and agricultural 
production and exports will benefit from increasing global food demand.

Non-commodity exports are expected to support growth 
An important aspect of the ongoing adjustment to lower commodity prices 
is the sequence of stronger non-commodity exports leading to increased 
investment, net firm creation and a rise in employment opportunities. This 
sequence is progressing, albeit unevenly. 

Recent monthly data on goods exports have disappointed. Looking through 
the monthly volatility, the Bank projects that the steady trend increase in 
non-commodity exports since the 2009 trough will continue (Chart 6). Non-
commodity exports are expected to exceed the pre-recession peak starting 
next year. 

Solid foreign demand and the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar will 
continue to support non-commodity exports. The profile for non-commodity 
exports has nevertheless been revised down, reflecting in part an unexpected 
but temporary slowdown in US investment earlier this year. Non-commodity 
export growth is expected to be slightly stronger in 2017–18, but the level of 
non-commodity exports remains somewhat lower at the end of 2018. 

The projected growth profile for non-commodity exports relies on historical 
relationships between non-commodity exports, foreign demand and the value 
of the Canadian dollar.6 The prolonged period of disappointing global growth 
and weak demand for Canadian exports caused some firms to exit and a 
permanent loss of capacity.7 As a result, the response of exports to improving

level permanently higher.

demand and competitiveness may take longer to materialize should invest-
ment in new capacity be required. In addition, the timing and magnitude of the 
benefits from the dollar’s earlier depreciation will vary across industries and 
will depend on the competitive position of other countries. 

Some of the more exchange-rate-sensitive categories of exports have been 
strengthening.8 The results of the spring 2016 EDC Trade Confidence Index 
Survey published by Export Development Canada and the Bank’s summer 
Business Outlook Survey (BOS) provide corroborating evidence of tangible 
positive effects of the lower dollar for Canadian exporters. Firms in the 
service industry that participated in the BOS anticipate robust sales, since 
many of them are benefiting from increasing foreign demand.

Improved exports are expected to lead to more business investment, net 
firm creation and hiring. The latest data on the population of firms show 
encouraging growth of 2 per cent (year-over-year) in the first quarter of 2016, 
reflecting both an increase in the number of new firms and a decrease in the 
number of exiting firms. As well, capacity pressures have increased in much 
of the manufacturing sector, and financing conditions remain favourable.9 In 
addition, the past depreciation of the dollar has boosted margins and cash 
flow denominated in Canadian dollars, providing funding to expand invest-
ment spending. 

These supportive business conditions have not yet translated into strong 
investment, likely because of uncertainty over future demand prospects and 
structural challenges.10 Consequently, the projection for investment growth 
has been marked down since April, with a small negative impact on poten-
tial output. Nevertheless, as both foreign and domestic demand increase, 
industries outside the resource sector will need to invest to expand produc-
tion. By the end of the year, non-resource investment is expected to dom-
inate, resulting in an expansion of total business investment, and contribute 
to rebuilding capacity and increasing potential output. Over the projection 
horizon, investment in machinery and equipment as a share of output should 
begin to recover (Chart 7). 

Household spending is expected to grow moderately
Consumption is projected to grow at a moderate pace, supported by con-
tinued employment growth in the non-resource sector and federal fiscal 
measures (notably, the Canada Child Benefit). A comparison of employment 
and retail sales across regions illustrates divergent adjustments to low oil 
prices, with households in the energy-producing provinces cutting expendi-
tures sharply (Chart 8). 

Over the projection horizon, real GDI is expected to rise with real GDP. While 
household expenditures will continue to be restrained by the ongoing wealth 
and income effects of the past decline in Canada’s terms of trade, the 
impact is expected to gradually diminish.

8  Examples include building and packaging materials; furniture and fixtures; travel services; large motor 
vehicles (e.g., heavy trucks and buses); pharmaceutical and medicinal products; and aircraft, aircraft 
engines and aircraft parts.

9  Most firms surveyed in the Bank’s summer BOS continue to characterize credit as easy or relatively 

easy to obtain. Nevertheless, firms directly or indirectly exposed to the energy sector again reported a 
tightening in credit conditions. Similarly, the further tightening in business-lending conditions reported 
by the Bank’s Senior Loan Officer Survey was concentrated in the oil and gas sector.

10  Some industries (for example, motor vehicles and forest products manufacturing) have closed or moved 

production capacity out of Canada in recent years because of differences in unit labour costs, future 
supply constraints and structural factors (such as weaker demand in northern United States and Canada 
for auto parts and the transition toward digital technologies reducing demand for paper products).

In the housing market, new construction and resale activity remain robust in 
British Columbia and Ontario, supported by strong demand, in part attribut-
able to population and employment growth. The same factors are fuelling 
house price increases in these regions, particularly the greater Vancouver and 
Toronto areas. Sharply rising prices in these markets over the past year raise 
the possibility that prices are also being driven by self-reinforcing expecta-
tions, making them more sensitive to an adverse shock to housing demand. In 
contrast, housing activity and house prices in the energy-producing provinces 
have declined; elsewhere in the country, housing growth has been modest, 
with most markets appearing balanced. Over the projection horizon, the 
contribution of residential investment to real GDP growth is anticipated to 
decrease and household sector vulnerabilities to stabilize.

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLICy REPORT  •  JULy 2016

Inflation will average close to 2 per cent in 2017 as the 
output gap narrows
Real GDP growth is projected to exceed potential output growth from 
the second half of 2016 (Table 2). The output gap is expected to close 
somewhat later than indicated in April, toward the end of 2017. The timing 
of the closing of the gap is highly uncertain and is influenced by downward 
revisions to both the projection for real GDP and potential output. The profile 
for potential output depends on the projection for investment spending, 
and both are currently subject to unusual uncertainty as a result of the 
economy’s ongoing complex structural adjustment as well as the difficult-to-
forecast effect of Brexit.

Total CPI inflation is projected to remain below 2 per cent through 2016 as 
disinflationary pressures associated with weak consumer energy prices and 
excess capacity more than offset the inflationary effects of exchange rate 
pass-through (Chart 9).11 The effects of these factors will gradually dissipate, 
and total CPI inflation is expected to average close to 2 per cent in 2017 as 
the output gap narrows. 

The near-term forecast for total CPI inflation is revised up from April, 
reflecting higher oil prices and some temporary factors. These factors 
include a revised view of the evolution of gasoline prices and tax changes.12

12  These changes include an increase in the harmonized sales tax (HST) in New Brunswick and

Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, a reasonable range 
around the base-case projection for total CPI inflation is ±0.3 percentage 
points. This range is intended to convey a sense of forecast uncertainty. 
A complementary perspective is provided using statistical analysis of 
the Bank’s forecast errors, which suggests that a 50 per cent confidence 
interval around the base-case projection widens from ±0.3 percentage 
points in the third quarter of 2016 to ±0.6 percentage points by the end of 
2018. Over the same period, a 90 per cent confidence band widens from 
±0.6 to ±1.5 percentage points.

Risks to thE inflation outlook  17 

Risks to the inflation outlook

The outlook for inflation is subject to several risks emanating from both 
the external environment and the domestic economy. Overall, the Bank 
judges that the risks to the projected path for inflation are roughly balanced. 
However, economic and geopolitical uncertainties have clearly risen in the 
wake of the Brexit vote. While the foreseeable consequences are incorpor-
ated into the Bank’s base-case projection, there may be wider ramifica-
tions that are difficult to forecast at this early stage and are therefore not 
included. 

Many of the risks mentioned in recent Reports remain important, although 
two that were identified in April—stronger momentum for Canadian exports 
and a more pronounced adjustment of the Canadian economy to low energy 
prices—are now viewed as less likely to materialize. 

(i)  Sluggish business investment

Business investment has been unexpectedly weak across a number 
of advanced economies, including the United States and Canada.13 
The lacklustre pace of business spending has been assumed to 
reflect mostly cyclical factors, such as slower growth of global 
demand and heightened uncertainty.14 But the weakness could also 
signal that demographic forces or some other structural factors are 
more relevant than previously estimated. Such factors would suggest 
a dimmer outlook for non-resource business investment in Canada 
than presented in the base-case projection. Weaker business invest-
ment would also reduce capital deepening and lower potential output, 
partially mitigating the disinflationary effect of weaker demand.

(ii)  Weaker household spending

Household spending is expected to grow moderately over the projec-
tion horizon, but a number of circumstances could lead to less robust 
spending than anticipated. Consumer sentiment remains lacklustre 
in the energy-producing provinces. At the same time, because 
households have become more indebted, their spending may be 
more sensitive to adverse shocks.15 Recent housing market develop-
ments, particularly in Vancouver and Toronto and adjacent areas,

Global Investment?” Bank of Canada Staff Discussion Paper No. 2016-05 (February 2016).

edness and to imbalances in the Canadian housing market, see the Bank of Canada Financial System 
Review (June 2016).

have exacerbated vulnerabilities in the household sector, increasing 
the likelihood and severity of a retrenchment in consumption should a 
house price correction occur.

(iii)  Higher oil prices 

Strengthening demand, as well as supply constraints, could con-
tribute to higher oil prices, although ongoing cost-cutting initiatives 
and technological advances would limit this upside potential. Growth 
in demand for gasoline has been robust in many major economies, 
especially the United States, suggesting that demand for oil may 
increase faster than expected. At the same time, persistently low 
investment in new oil projects since 2014 has significantly reduced 
prospects for supply growth. Shale oil production in the United States 
has declined substantially, and conventional oil production in other 
non-OPEC countries, including Canada, has been decreasing.16 
Future production capacity may not be sufficient to meet demand, 
putting upward pressure on prices. Higher-than-expected oil prices 
would contribute to an improvement in Canada’s terms of trade, pro-
viding a positive boost to wealth and household spending in Canada. 

(iv)  Slower growth in emerging-market economies 

Slower growth in EMEs is a downside risk, particularly in those 
that hold high levels of foreign-currency-denominated debt and in 
commodity exporters facing fiscal and other pressures. In China, 
increased emphasis by the authorities on short-term growth is con-
tributing to a further buildup of financial imbalances. Slower growth in 
EMEs could affect Canada through several channels, including lower 
commodity prices, weaker export sales, increased uncertainty and 
financial market volatility. 

(v)  Stronger real GDP growth in the United States

The downward revisions to the April Report’s projection of potential 
GDP growth in the United States could reflect an overly conservative 
interpretation of labour market and productivity trends. Productivity in 
the United States may rise more than expected if the persistent weak-
ness in US growth includes a larger-than-estimated cyclical element. 
In particular, the ongoing recovery could lead to an acceleration in the 
rate of firm creation and more technological innovation. As well, the 
strong labour market and the creation of new businesses may draw 
more discouraged workers back into the labour force than expected. 
Any of these developments would raise the potential growth rate of 
the US economy, boosting real GDP growth. Stronger US economic 
growth could have positive spillovers to Canada from greater demand 
for Canadian exports and improved global confidence.

16  Non-OPEC countries are those that are not members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting 

Countries.

Canada’s Inflation-Control Strategy1
Inflation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote 

the economic and financial well-being of Canadians.

pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s 
outlook, including risks to the projection, are published four 
times per year in the Monetary Policy Report.

  Canada’s experience with inflation targeting since 1991 has 

shown that the best way to foster confidence in the value 
of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth, 
employment gains and improved living standards is by keeping 
inflation low, stable and predictable.

Inflation targeting is symmetric and flexible
  Canada’s inflation-targeting approach is symmetric, which 

means that the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising 
above or falling below the 2 percent target.

  In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 

Canada’s inflation-control target for a further five-year period, 
ending December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the 
consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 percent midpoint 
of the control range of 1 to 3 percent.

  Canada’s inflation-targeting framework is flexible. Typically, 

the Bank seeks to return inflation to target over a horizon of six 
to eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for 
returning inflation to target will vary depending on the nature 
and persistence of the shocks buffeting the economy.

The monetary policy instrument
  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes in the 

target for the overnight rate of interest.2 These changes are 
transmitted to the economy through their influence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate, 
which affect total demand for Canadian goods and services. 
The balance between this demand and the economy’s 
production capacity is, over time, the primary determinant of 
inflation pressures in the economy.

  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight 
quarters—to work their way through the economy and have 
their full effect on inflation. For this reason, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent com-
munications, the Bank regularly reports its perspective on 
the forces at work on the economy and their implications for 
inflation. The Monetary Policy Report is a key element of this 
approach. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight 

Monitoring inflation
  In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in 
indirect taxes such as GST, can cause sizable fluctuations in 
CPI.

  In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through 

such transitory movements in CPI inflation and focuses on a 
set of “core” inflation measures that better reflect the under-
lying trend of inflation. In this sense, these measures act as an 
operational guide to help the Bank achieve the CPI inflation 
target. They are not a replacement for CPI inflation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core inflation are CPI-
trim, which excludes CPI components whose rates of change 
in a given month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which 
corresponds to the price change located at the 50th percentile 
(in terms of basket weight) of the distribution of price changes; 
and CPI-common, which uses a statistical procedure to track 
common price changes across categories in the CPI basket.

Inflation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide additional  monetary 

stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website, 
describes these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Global Economy

After a period of synchronous slowing, the global economy is showing signs 
of stabilizing. Global growth is projected to strengthen gradually, largely as 
expected in the October Report (Table 1). Survey data suggest that manu-
facturing activity is starting to pick up in many regions (Chart 1). Service 
sector indicators have softened recently but remain healthy. Unemployment 
rates continue to be near historic lows in many advanced economies.

Recent trade developments have been positive. The Phase One trade agree-
ment between the United States and China cancelled previously scheduled 
tariff increases and reduced some other existing tariffs. As well, ratifica-
tion of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) is pending. 
Nonetheless, disruptions to supply chains from past trade actions, elevated 
uncertainty and ongoing geopolitical tensions continue to weigh on global 
economic activity.1

Last observation: December 2019

Global growth is expected to increase modestly to around 3 1/4 percent by 
2021, with some divergence across regions. Growth in the United States 
and China is projected to continue to slow, while growth in other major 
emerging-market economies (EMEs) should pick up. Although the US 
economy is anticipated to slow, business investment and industrial produc-
tion—important sources of demand for Canadian exports—are expected to 
strengthen later in the projection horizon. Overall, accommodative monetary 
policy and favourable financial conditions will continue to support global 
economic activity.

Global trade and investment to improve
After slowing sharply in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, 
growth of global trade and business investment seems to be bottoming out. 
Notably, global sales of motor vehicles and semiconductors have steadied 
after contracting abruptly in late 2018 (Chart 2). Moreover, new orders of 
manufactured goods have begun to increase.

Global trade and investment are expected to strengthen over the projection 
horizon, although only modestly. This is because past increases in tariffs 
and ongoing uncertainty will continue to take a toll on activity. This drag on 
global growth is expected to gradually dissipate. However, the total impact 
of these trade tensions leaves the level of global gross domestic product 
(GDP) 1.2 percent lower by the end of 2021.2 The impact of trade tensions is 
marginally smaller than what had been incorporated in the October projec-
tion, reflecting the recent Phase One trade agreement between the United 
States and China.3

2  Escalating trade measures and related uncertainty have been a drag on the global economy since 2017. 

The Bank estimates that about half of the effect on the level of global GDP reported here occurred by 
the end of 2019.

3  The estimated impact of trade tensions was 1.3 percent in the October Report.

Positive financial market reaction to trade developments
Market sentiment has improved in recent months, reflecting the percep-
tion that risks related to trade tensions and global growth have diminished. 
Equity prices have continued to strengthen to record highs, and credit 
spreads have narrowed. The US dollar has edged lower as safe-haven flows 
have abated. Following a period of widespread central bank easing, expect-
ations of additional policy stimulus by major central banks have moderated. 
Overall, investors continue to search for yield in a global environment of low 
interest rates, and the appetite for high-quality assets remains robust. In this 
context, yields of government bonds globally have increased only modestly 
and yield curves have steepened. The Canadian dollar has generally traded 
in a narrow range against the US dollar.

The recent escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East has injected 
some additional uncertainty into financial markets and temporarily pushed 
up the price of some assets, such as gold and oil.

Overall, financial market indicators are consistent with the view that global 
growth has bottomed out and global economic activity should gradually 
improve.

US economy to grow at about potential
The US economy continued to grow faster than potential in 2019, although 
it slowed from the strong pace in 2018. The slowing was broad-based, 
reflecting in part the combination of waning stimulus from the 2018 tax cuts 
and a growing drag from trade tensions. Business investment, trade and 
industrial production were affected by the trade conflict with China and 
lower production at Boeing. Investment in construction and oil structures 
also contracted. As well, the manufacturing sector was held back by weak 
production of motor vehicles. Growth of consumer spending and activity in

the service sector also slowed. However, they remained solid, supported by 
the strong labour market. Spending on consumer durable goods and activity 
in the housing market have picked up in recent months, partly in response 
to lower borrowing costs.

US growth is expected to slow toward potential over the next two years as 
the fiscal stance of the United States shifts from expansionary to broadly 
neutral. Nonetheless, growth of US business investment is projected to pick 
up in response to the recent improvement in financial conditions (Chart 3). 
Along with easier financial conditions, the economic outlook is margin-
ally stronger than in October, reflecting the effects of the Phase One trade 
agreement with China.

Core inflation remains below target largely due to several temporary factors 
affecting prices of financial services and clothing. As the effects of these 
factors dissipate, core inflation is expected to gradually return to target over 
the projection horizon.

Other advanced economies to post modest growth
Economic activity has remained subdued in the euro area. Headwinds asso-
ciated with Brexit, trade policy uncertainty and regulatory changes affecting 
the auto sector continue to weigh on firms. However, recent survey data 
indicate that business sentiment has stopped deteriorating and that the 
manufacturing sector is stabilizing. The labour market remains solid. Growth 
is expected to continue hovering around 1 percent in early 2020. It should 
then pick up modestly as foreign demand improves and the monetary 
measures implemented in 2019 by the European Central Bank support the 
economy. Core inflation has risen somewhat in recent months but remains 
well below target.

While the outlook for growth in Japan remains modest, it has been revised 
up materially since October, driven by the announcement of new fiscal 
measures.

Growth to continue slowing in China
Growth in China continues to moderate, largely as anticipated in the 
October Report. Over much of 2019, growth was constrained by trade ten-
sions, regulatory efforts to contain financial system vulnerabilities and high 
food prices. Nonetheless, financial vulnerabilities remain elevated amid 
high debt and concerns over risk exposure. Growth is projected to mod-
erate from about 6 percent in 2019 to about 5 3/4 percent in 2021, given 
the expected easing of potential growth and ongoing efforts to stabilize 
leverage. Economic growth should nevertheless be supported by reduced 
drag from trade tensions.

Growth in other oil-importing EMEs slowed in 2019, partly as a result of 
 geopolitical and trade tensions. Financial conditions also weighed on 
activity in several EMEs, notably India. Growth is projected to pick up as 
policy provides support and financial conditions improve. Nonetheless, the 
outlook is marked down from the October Report, reflecting a larger drag 
from financial stress in India.

In oil-exporting economies, oil production cuts by member countries of 
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some 
other oil producers hampered economic growth over 2019. New cuts were 
announced by these countries in December. Growth for these countries is 
nevertheless expected to gradually increase, supported in part by recent 
policy easing.

Oil prices have moved higher
The recent average prices of Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil 
are US$65 and US$60 per barrel, respectively—each US$5 higher than 
assumed in the October Report (Box 1, page 10). While the recent improve-
ment in market sentiment contributed to the increase, heightened geopolit-
ical tensions in the Middle East and further oil production cuts announced 
by OPEC members also played a role. Despite these cuts, global oil output 
is expected to increase in 2020, supported by solid, albeit slowing, produc-
tion growth in the United States (Chart 4).

The main risks to the Bank’s assumption for oil prices relate to geopolit-
ical tensions and global supply. Prices could increase further if tensions 
between the United States and Iran escalate. In contrast, stronger produc-
tion by non-OPEC countries, including the United States, would put down-
ward pressure on prices.

The spread between the prices of WTI and Western Canadian Select has 
widened since the October Report, recently averaging about US$20. This 
widening reflects an unexpected increase in oil inventories following the 
Keystone oil spill and the Canadian National Railway strike, both of which 
disrupted oil transportation. Looking ahead, oil production should increase 
along with improved transportation capacity.

Prices of some base metals have risen modestly since the October Report, 
consistent with improved sentiment about global growth prospects. Prices 
of lumber and agricultural products have changed little since October.

Canadian Economy

The Canadian economy has been operating relatively close to potential, with 
a healthy labour market and inflation near 2 percent. However, economic 
activity in Canada slowed in the last quarter of 2019, and recent data sug-
gest that some of this loss of momentum will spill over into early 2020. The 
pace of activity is expected to pick up through the first half of 2020 and then 
remain just above the rate of potential thereafter.

The recent slowdown reflects global and domestic factors. Global trade 
conflicts and related uncertainty have been weighing on business invest-
ment and exports. Some temporary factors have also been holding back 
exports. In response to weaker demand, manufacturers have reduced pro-
duction to lessen the buildup of their inventories. In this environment, growth 
of employment and household spending softened.

Over the projection horizon, business investment and exports are antici-
pated to improve as oil transportation capacity expands and the impact of 
trade policy headwinds on global growth diminishes. Household spending 
is projected to strengthen, driven by solid growth of both the population and 
household disposable income.

Growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2019 and 2020. The pace of activity 
is anticipated to strengthen to 2.0 percent in 2021 (Table 2).

Compared with the October Report, the estimate for growth in 2019 has 
been revised up, mainly because of historical data revisions to both busi-
ness and government investment. The outlook for growth has been revised 
down in 2020 and up in 2021. The markdown for 2020 reflects weaker 
growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 than previ-
ously forecast. Beyond the near term, higher estimates for the working-age 
population and reductions in federal income tax support growth through the 
projection horizon. Overall, the level of GDP is anticipated to be higher by 
the end of 2021 than projected in October.

The Bank’s core measures of inflation are around 2 percent, although with 
some increase in dispersion. The core measures are consistent with an 
economy that has been operating close to potential. Consumer price index 
(CPI) inflation is expected to remain close to the 2 percent target over the 
projection horizon.

Growth softened at the end of 2019
The Bank estimates that growth in the fourth quarter slowed to 0.3 percent. 
Growth is forecast to rebound in the first quarter of 2020 but remain mod-
erate at 1.3 percent (Table 2, Table 3 and Chart 5). This outlook is about 
three-quarters of a percentage point lower on average than in the October 
projection. Weakness in global economic activity is contributing to a larger 
adjustment of inventories than previously anticipated. Consumption and 
housing are also weaker than forecast. As well, special factors, including 
labour disputes, production disruptions and adverse weather, are affecting 
near-term growth dynamics.

Challenges in the oil and gas sector and the difficult global environment 
continue to weigh on business investment and exports. There are early 
indications that the level of investment in the oil and gas sector is stabil-
izing.4 Outside the oil and gas sector, business investment is estimated 
to be growing modestly amid ongoing global uncertainty. In particular, 
spending on machinery and equipment is likely to remain soft in the near 
term. Exports continued to contract in the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting 
weak global demand and the end of motor vehicle production at the General 
Motors plant in Oshawa. In addition, exports were affected by temporary 
factors, including the Keystone pipeline outage and the Canadian National 
Railway strike. Exports are expected to expand in the first quarter of 2020 
as the impact of these factors fades.

Household spending softened in late 2019. The effects of global trade con-
flicts and elevated uncertainty may have spread beyond investment and 
exports, contributing to the slowdown in the labour market and weighing 
on confidence. This may have contributed to more cautious behaviour by 
households. Weakness in the manufacturing sector and fiscal tightening in 

4  Historical data on engineering investment in the oil and gas sector have been revised up. This, together 

with recent survey data, indicates that capital spending in that sector contracted by less in 2019 than 
anticipated in the October Report. It is, however, about 55 percent below where it was before the 
2014–16 drop in oil prices.

some provinces have also likely dampened sentiment. Consumption growth 
is expected to pick up in the first quarter of 2020, in keeping with a healthy 
labour market and firm income growth.

The level of housing activity remains solid across most of Canada, although 
recent indicators suggest that residential investment growth has slowed 
from its previously strong pace. Demand remains robust in Quebec, where 
the labour market has been strong. In Ontario and British Columbia, popu-
lation growth is boosting housing demand. In contrast, Alberta’s housing 
market continues to adjust to challenges in the oil and gas sector. Nationally, 
house prices have continued to increase and should strengthen slightly in 
the near term, consistent with the responses to the Bank’s recent Canadian 
Survey of Consumer Expectations.

Excess capacity has increased modestly
The Bank estimates that the output gap was between -1.25 and -0.25 per-
cent in the fourth quarter of 2019. This range implies more spare  capacity 
than in the third quarter, reflecting slower growth in the fourth quarter 
(Box 1).

Excess capacity remains concentrated primarily in energy-producing 
regions. Elsewhere, indicators of capacity pressures and labour shortages 
have suggested little slack. In the winter Business Outlook Survey, firms out-
side the Prairies reported that labour-related capacity pressures have con-
tinued to increase (Chart 6).

Overall, the labour market continues to be healthy. Job gains were strong 
through 2019. These new jobs were concentrated in the service sector and 
were largely full-time. Job vacancies remain elevated, and the unemploy-
ment rate is close to a historically low level. In recent months, however, job 
growth has slowed, mainly in manufacturing and public administration. The 
average number of hours worked has decreased somewhat in the manufac-
turing sector, consistent with softer demand conditions, but has fallen by 
more in the service sector and in regions with little slack. This could in part 
be because tight conditions are drawing into the labour market more young 
and older workers, who typically work fewer hours.5 In contrast, labour 
market conditions are soft in the Prairies and job growth is slower than in 
other regions.

Wage growth has been firm through 2019, with a broad-based pickup 
across regions. The Bank’s composite measure of wage growth, the wage-
common, is estimated to have remained at 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter, 
nearly a percentage point higher than in the first quarter of 2019 (Chart 7).

The Bank estimates that CPI inflation was close to the 2 percent target in 
the fourth quarter (Table 3). In November, CPI inflation increased to 2.2 per-
cent from 1.9 percent in previous months and likely remained slightly above 
target in December, driven largely by higher gasoline prices. Core inflation 
measures have been around 2 percent, although the dispersion of these 
measures has increased (Chart 8).6 Measures of core inflation are consistent 
with an economy that has been operating close to capacity.

5  As part of the Bank’s annual assessment of potential output, staff will examine the implications for 

trend labour input of the evolution of average hours worked and new population estimates, including 
data on immigration. New estimates will be provided in the April 2020 Report.

6  This dispersion is likely related to volatility in goods prices and should prove temporary. More generally, 

each measure provides an alternative and complementary evaluation of underlying inflation. Together, 
they provide an indication of the evolution of the output gap. The Bank considers the full range of 
measures in the conduct of monetary policy. For details, see the Bank of Canada website.

Economic growth to increase to around potential
The Bank anticipates that economic activity will improve through 2020 and 
grow just above the rate of potential in 2021 (Chart 9 and Box 1). Household 
spending is expected to strengthen and grow at a moderate pace. The 
contribution to growth from business investment and exports should also 
increase as foreign demand improves, the impact from trade policy uncer-
tainty diminishes and oil transportation capacity expands. In this context, 
activity in the goods sector should strengthen, and the pace of  inventory 
investment is projected to improve. Meanwhile, growth of government 
spending is expected to slow, consistent with fiscal measures announced 
in provincial budgets.

Household spending growth to pick up
Household spending growth over 2020 and 2021 should be supported by a 
rising working-age population, solid labour income growth and reductions in 
federal income tax.7

Consumption growth is expected to strengthen in 2020, following a period of 
softness. However, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the degree 
of persistence of the recent softness. In the context of elevated indebted-
ness, households are expected to remain somewhat more cautious in their 
consumption decisions, and the savings rate is anticipated to rise mod-
estly. However, a healthy labour market and rising wealth should lift house-
hold demand over the projection horizon. Considering these factors, in the 
Bank’s base-case projection, consumer spending gradually strengthens and 
then grows at a pace in line with disposable income (Chart 10).

Housing activity is projected to continue its recovery in 2020, then evolve 
roughly in line with the underlying fundamentals. With resales having 
rebounded in 2019, new construction is expected to be the main driver of 
growth in residential investment over the projection horizon. The share of 
multiples in housing starts should continue to trend upward, due to their 
relative affordability and to growing demand in urban areas.

Business investment and exports to expand at a moderate 
pace
Growth of both business investment and exports is expected to increase 
over the projection horizon. This is in line with a steady rise in the growth of 
foreign demand after a period of weakness. As well, the Phase One trade 
agreement between the United States and China and the pending ratifica-
tion of CUSMA should be positive for growth. While trade policy uncer-
tainty will continue to restrain the level of business investment and exports, 
its effect on growth should diminish gradually over the next two years 
(Chart 11a).8

Business investment outside the oil and gas sector is expected to grow at 
a moderate pace in 2020 and 2021 (Chart 11b). This outlook is consistent 
with the responses to the winter Business Outlook Survey. Business senti-
ment remained healthy, particularly outside oil-producing regions (Chart 12). 
Investment intentions are positive in the service sector, notably for spending 
on new technology. Overall, the strength of the service sector and the digit-
alization of the economy will continue to support business investment. 
In addition, large infrastructure projects, such as LNG Canada and Trans 
Mountain, will boost capital spending in the transportation sector.

Non-energy exports are expected to expand over the projection horizon, 
supported by firming foreign demand. However, motor vehicle exports are a 
notable exception. They are forecast to decline as production mandates for 
Canadian motor vehicle assemblers are reduced and US sales growth slows 
(Chart 13).

After slowing in 2019, import growth should pick up in 2020 and 2021, in line 
with strengthening domestic demand and export growth.

8  The Bank estimates that trade tensions and the related uncertainty will remove about 1.8 percent from 

the level of GDP by the end of 2021 through their direct and indirect effects on business investment 
and exports. This impact is 0.2 percentage points smaller than what was incorporated in the October 
projection. The modest reduction reflects recent positive trade policy developments.

Last observation: 2019Q4

In the oil and gas sector, improving transportation capacity and the easing 
of production constraints are expected to support stronger production.9 
As a result, growth of energy exports should pick up in 2020 and 2021 
(Chart 14). As business sentiment improves with the expansion of transpor-
tation capacity, investment in the sector should expand in 2021.

9  New transportation capacity will come from ongoing and upcoming pipeline optimization and expan-
sion projects; from Enbridge Line 3, expected to be completed by mid-2021; and from growing use of 
rail for shipments of crude. The Alberta government recently eliminated mandated production limits for

be phased out through 2020 for producers still subject to production constraints.

CPI inflation to remain close to 2 percent
The Bank forecasts CPI inflation will be around the 2 percent inflation target 
over the projection horizon (Table 2), with small fluctuations in 2020 resulting 
from volatility in energy prices. The boost from the federal carbon pollution 
charge is expected to roughly offset modest downward pressures from eco-
nomic slack (Chart 15).

The projection is consistent with medium- and long-term inflation expecta-
tions remaining well anchored. Almost all firms responding to the Business 
Outlook Survey anticipate that inflation will remain within the Bank’s target 
range of 1 to 3 percent over the next two years. Most respondents to the 
Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations anticipate inflation will be

within that range or just above it over the next two years.10 The December 
2019 Consensus Economics forecast for CPI inflation is 2.0 percent in 2019 
and 1.9 percent in 2020. Responses to a quarterly question on long-term 
inflation expectations show an average of 2.0 percent through 2029.

The base-case projection provides the Bank’s view of the most likely out-
come for inflation, although any projection is subject to considerable 
uncertainty. Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, a 
reasonable range around the projection for CPI inflation is ±0.3 percentage 
points. A complementary perspective using statistical analysis of the Bank’s 
forecast errors suggests that a 50 percent confidence interval around the 
base-case projection widens from ±0.2 percentage points in the first quarter 
of 2020 to ±0.6 percentage points by the end of 2021. Over the same period, 
a 90 percent confidence band widens from ±0.6 to ±1.4 percentage points.

10  As in other countries, household inflation expectations in Canada tend to be somewhat higher than 

observed inflation. For more details, see the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations.

RisKs to thE inFlation outlooK  19 

Risks to the inflation outlook

The outlook for inflation is subject to several upside and downside risks. 
In recent reports, the Bank identified trade policy tensions and the asso-
ciated uncertainty as the most important risk to the Canadian economy. 
The pending ratification of CUSMA and the Phase One trade agree-
ment between the United States and China have been positive develop-
ments. In this context, the Bank judges that a more extreme downside 
scenario related to trade tensions has become less likely over the projec-
tion horizon.11 Nonetheless, the risks associated with trade policies remain 
important, as discussed below.

However, geopolitical tensions centred in the Middle East have recently 
intensified, with tragic consequences. Further sharp escalation of tensions 
could have significant negative macroeconomic impacts on the global 
economy. The Bank’s base-case projection assumes that this risk will not 
materialize.

Aside from geopolitical risk, the Bank assesses that risks to the projected 
path for inflation are roughly balanced. As in past reports, the Bank pre-
sents a selection of risks identified as most important to the projected path 
for inflation, drawing from a larger set of risks considered in the base-case 
projection. Table 4 summarizes the evolution of some of the key risks since 
October. Historical data revisions show that the savings rate has been 
higher in recent years than previously estimated. This has helped balance 
the risk of stronger consumption in Canada that was identified in October. 
As a result, this risk is no longer listed below.

(i)  Global trade tensions ( and )

This risk relates to trade policy tensions between the United States 
and its trading partners. Because the Bank’s base-case projection 
incorporates the adverse effects of announced tariffs and elevated 
trade policy uncertainty, the trade policy risk is two-sided.

If current trade tensions were resolved and increases in tariffs intro-
duced over the past two years reversed, economic activity and infla-
tion in Canada would be stronger. Alternatively, trade conflicts could 
escalate again or become more widespread, which would negatively 
affect global and Canadian GDP. The net effect of increased trade 
tensions on Canadian inflation would depend on several factors. While 
weaker aggregate demand would reduce inflationary pressures, a 
weaker Canadian dollar and lower productivity would push inflation up.

11  Box 2 of the July 2019 Report considered two extreme risk scenarios, a positive one and a negative 

one, to illustrate the forces that would come into play.

(ii)  Stronger residential investment ( in the near term) 

and rising household vulnerabilities in Canada ( in the 
medium term)
The rebound in housing could be stronger than anticipated in the 
base-case projection. Stronger housing demand could put additional 
pressure on already-elevated house prices in some regions, increase 
borrowing and exacerbate household vulnerabilities. This would 
particularly be the case if growth in housing outpaces fundamentals, 
especially if speculative activity re-emerges.

(iii)  Sharp tightening of global financial conditions ()

Recent movements in equity prices and risk premiums generally 
embody optimistic views about corporate earnings and economic 
growth. Financial conditions could tighten suddenly if growth in major 
economies were to fall short of market expectations or tail risks were 
to re-emerge. Similarly, an upward shift in inflation expectations could 
raise global interest rates, leading to higher debt-service burdens and 
reduced activity in sectors sensitive to the interest rate. In both cases, 
global and Canadian growth would weaken.

(iv)  Weaker growth in emerging-market economies ()

China’s efforts to stimulate its economy to offset trade tensions or 
other headwinds, while constraining credit growth, could be chal-
lenging. As well, credit growth could fall by more than expected as 
authorities allow an increase in defaults of private sector bonds. In 
other oil-importing EMEs, the recovery could be more sluggish than 
expected in the base-case projection. In particular, the financial stress 
in India and ongoing political challenges in some EMEs could have 
larger and more persistent effects. Such developments could put 
downward pressure on global growth and commodity prices.

(v)  Stronger potential output growth in the United States ()

Potential output could be higher than currently embedded in the 
Bank’s base-case projection. This could be due to digitalization or a 
lower natural rate of unemployment.12 Stronger growth in the struc-
tural drivers of the US economy would result in higher US household 
spending and private investment. This would boost demand for 
Canadian exports and exert upward pressure on Canadian inflation.

12  See S. S. Poloz, “Technological Progress and Monetary Policy: Managing the Fourth Industrial 

Revolution,” Bank of Canada Staff Discussion Paper No. 2019-11 (November 2019), for a discussion on 
the implications of digitalization for potential output.

Canada’s Inflation-Control Strategy1
Inflation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote 

the economic and financial well-being of Canadians.

pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s 
outlook, including risks to the projection, are published four 
times per year in the Monetary Policy Report.

  Canada’s experience with inflation targeting since 1991 has 

shown that the best way to foster confidence in the value 
of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth, 
employment gains and improved living standards is by keeping 
inflation low, stable and predictable.

Inflation targeting is symmetric and flexible
  Canada’s inflation-targeting approach is symmetric, which 

means that the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising 
above or falling below the 2 per cent target.

  In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 

Canada’s inflation-control target for a further five-year period, 
ending December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the 
consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 per cent midpoint 
of the control range of 1 to 3 per cent.

  Canada’s inflation-targeting framework is flexible. Typically, 

the Bank seeks to return inflation to target over a horizon of six 
to eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for 
returning inflation to target will vary depending on the nature 
and persistence of the shocks buffeting the economy.

The monetary policy instrument
  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes in the 

target for the overnight rate of interest.2 These changes are 
transmitted to the economy through their influence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate, 
which affect total demand for Canadian goods and services. 
The balance between this demand and the economy’s 
production capacity is, over time, the primary determinant of 
inflation pressures in the economy.

  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight 
quarters—to work their way through the economy and have 
their full effect on inflation. For this reason, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent com-
munications, the Bank regularly reports its perspective on 
the forces at work on the economy and their implications for 
inflation. The Monetary Policy Report is a key element of this 
approach. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight 

Monitoring inflation
  In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in 
indirect taxes such as GST, can cause sizable fluctuations in 
CPI.

  In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through 

such transitory movements in CPI inflation and focuses on a 
set of “core” inflation measures that better reflect the under-
lying trend of inflation. In this sense, these measures act as an 
operational guide to help the Bank achieve the CPI inflation 
target. They are not a replacement for CPI inflation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core inflation are CPI-
trim, which excludes CPI components whose rates of change 
in a given month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which 
corresponds to the price change located at the 50th percentile 
(in terms of basket weight) of the distribution of price changes; 
and CPI-common, which uses a statistical procedure to track 
common price changes across categories in the CPI basket.

1  See Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target (October 24, 2016) and Renewal of the 

Inflation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide additional  monetary 

stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website, 
describes these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Global Economy

The global economic expansion continues to strengthen and broaden 
across countries (Chart 1a). Growth in the United States rebounded in the 
second quarter, and the expansion in the euro area appears to have firmed 
(Chart 1b). Economic activity is also showing signs of improvement in 
some oil-exporting countries and emerging-market economies (EMEs) that 
were previously in recession. Global growth is projected to average around 
3 1/2 per cent over the 2017–19 period, in line with the projections in the July 
Monetary Policy Report (Table 1).

Inflation has remained below target across most advanced economies, 
reflecting past excess capacity, still-weak wage growth and, in some cases, 
temporary factors. Inflation in wages and prices is expected to rise gradually 
as existing slack is absorbed.

The global outlook remains subject to substantial uncertainty, notably 
around US trade policy as well as geopolitical developments. The Bank’s 
base-case projection continues to include some judgment that acknow-
ledges the potential adverse effects of uncertainty on investment.

Accommodative global financial conditions are 
supporting growth
Global financial conditions remain accommodative. Yields on long-term 
sovereign bonds have changed little on average since July; in particular, 
in the United States, Germany and Japan, yields have fluctuated within a 
narrow range. Stock market indexes in advanced economies have con-
tinued to climb amid improving economic sentiment and conditions. The 
US Federal Reserve’s process of normalizing its balance sheet that began 
in October is expected to contribute to a modest and gradual steepening 
of the US yield curve. However, the announcement of these plans in 
September had a minimal impact on yields.

Partly reflecting increased uncertainty over US trade and fiscal policy, as 
well as softer inflation prospects, the US dollar had been weakening in 
2017 against a basket of currencies, although it has regained some strength 
recently.

The US economy is projected to expand at a moderate pace
Economic growth in the United States rebounded in the second quarter, as 
anticipated in the July Report. Consumption growth improved after a weak 
first quarter. Business investment growth remained robust, supported by, 
but not limited to, the ongoing recovery in energy investment (Chart 2). In 
contrast, residential investment contracted following two quarters of strong 
growth, as spending on renovations and commissions on sales of existing 
homes declined.

The outlook for economic growth for the second half of 2017 is roughly 
unchanged from July. The recent hurricanes had a devastating impact on 
affected communities, with significant albeit transitory aggregate economic 
effects. Consumption, housing and business investment are likely to be 
negatively affected, resulting in a lower outlook for growth in gross domestic 
product (GDP) in the third quarter. Recovery and reconstruction efforts are 
expected to provide a modest boost to economic activity starting in the 
fourth quarter.

Overall, economic fundamentals remain consistent with projected GDP 
growth of about 2 per cent on average over 2017–19. Business investment is 
expected to expand at a solid pace. Consumption growth is anticipated to 
stay firm, supported by strong labour market conditions. Net exports, how-
ever, will likely continue to be a drag on growth.

As in July, the Bank’s base-case projection does not incorporate any new 
fiscal or trade measures. While sizable tax cuts are under active considera-
tion, material uncertainty remains about whether agreement will be reached 
on such a package and, if so, its size, timing and design. If stimulative fiscal 
measures were enacted, growth could be higher than projected. Likewise, 
growth could be lower if protectionist trade policies led to a generalized 
decline in cross-border co-operation.

The euro area economy has gained momentum
Second-quarter growth in the euro area was stronger than expected and 
remained broad-based across member countries. Data since the July 
Report also point to more momentum in economic activity than previ-
ously anticipated. As a result, the growth outlook for 2017 is now above 
2 per cent. Growth should moderate gradually in 2018, reaching about 
1 1/2 per cent in 2019, roughly in line with the pace of expansion of potential 
output.

In Japan, economic activity in the second quarter strengthened significantly 
more than expected, resulting in an improved economic outlook for 2017. 
Growth was driven by a boost to public investment and a pickup in con-
sumption. Overall, growth should slow to around 1 per cent over 2018–19, 
reflecting demographics and other structural factors, and a sluggish pace of 
nominal wage increases.

Inflation continues to track below target in advanced 
economies
Inflation has remained soft and generally below target in several advanced 
economies (Chart 3). Given the lag between economic activity and inflation, 
the ongoing strength in growth can be expected to contribute to improve-
ments in labour market conditions and, therefore, a gradual firming in wage 
and price inflation.

The softness in core inflation in advanced economies has mainly been 
due to past excess capacity. However, in contrast to the United States, 
the decline in many countries that started in 2016 was likely associated 
with prior appreciation of their currencies and with falling prices of goods 
imported from emerging markets, notably China.1 The effects of these fac-
tors appear to have largely dissipated, as suggested by the uptick in infla-
tion in the euro area and Japan in recent months.

In the United States, core inflation started declining in 2017 despite the 
depreciation of the US dollar. A large part of this slowdown can be attributed 
to lower prices for services, such as telecommunications. Looking ahead, 
core inflation in the United States is expected to reach 2 per cent by 2019 as 
a tight labour market exerts upward pressure on wage inflation. 

While the Bank assesses inflation dynamics through the lens of economic 
slack and inflation expectations, the continuing softness in inflation across 
a number of advanced economies calls for further analysis. One possible 
explanation is that the behaviour of inflation in advanced economies has 
changed, and inflation is now less responsive to changes in economic slack

than in the past.2 Another possibility is that technological advances, such 
as the rise of e-commerce and the digital economy, may be playing a role. 
So far, available evidence suggests that the overall effects of these techno-
logical factors on inflation are small, but the Bank will continue to examine 
the potential role of these and other factors (Box 1, page 8).

Emerging markets continue to drive global growth
Economic activity in China has been somewhat stronger than anticipated, 
with GDP expanding robustly in the third quarter. Nevertheless, growth is 
expected to soften in the coming quarters, mainly as a result of earlier policy 
measures targeting the housing and financial sectors and a smaller contri-
bution from fiscal policy. Despite some progress on financial sector delever-
aging, financial stability risks remain elevated as total credit continues to 
expand at a strong pace. Looking ahead, economic growth is expected to 
moderate from 6.8 per cent in 2017 to 6.3 per cent in 2019 as it continues to 
shift toward a more sustainable pace and composition.

For oil-importing EMEs, the economic environment has remained gener-
ally favourable, with narrow credit spreads and sustained capital inflows. 
GDP growth should average about 4 per cent over 2017–19, supported by 
ongoing recoveries in countries previously in recession and progress on 
growth-enhancing reforms. In India, economic growth has been dragged 
down by the lingering adverse effects of the currency exchange initiative 
launched in late 2016 as well as by the transitory costs associated with the 
introduction of the national goods and services tax in July. Notwithstanding 
the effects on near-term growth, these and other major reforms are 
expected to support medium-term growth in India.

Growth in the “rest of the world” grouping is expected to increase from 
about 1 1/2 per cent in 2017 to around 2 3/4 per cent in 2019. The economic 
adjustment in oil-exporting countries is progressing as the impact from past 
declines in oil prices eases.

Prices of oil and industrial commodities have risen
By convention, oil prices are assumed to remain close to their recent 
average of about US$55 per barrel (Brent), roughly US$5 higher than 
assumed in July (Box 2, page 9). Prices have been supported by stronger-
than-expected demand over the summer, with US demand for gasoline 
reaching a five-year high. Declines in US crude oil inventories over the last 
six months and a recent stabilization in the number of active US oil rigs sug-
gest that the oil market is rebalancing (Chart 4).

Over the near term, risks to the oil price assumption are tilted to the down-
side. Prices could be lower if excess supply results from a pickup in shale 
drilling activity in the United States or from a deterioration in compliance 
with agreed production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting 
Countries and some other oil producers.

Prices of some non-energy commodities have also increased since July. 
Spot prices for base metals have risen by about 12 per cent in response to a 
combination of stronger global demand and commodity-specific supply fac-
tors. Strong steel production in China over the summer supported the rise 

2  For example, the IMF’s April 2013 World Economic Outlook finds evidence that the responsiveness of 

inflation to unemployment has been declining gradually since the mid-1970s. This flattening of the Phillips 
curve was found to hold throughout a sample of more than 20 advanced economies. These findings 
suggest that the inflation consequences of changes in economic slack are much smaller than in the past.

in prices of certain base metals, such as iron, nickel and zinc. In addition, 
higher aluminum prices have been supported by cuts to capacity in China, 
while concerns over further disruptions to mining activity in the Philippines 
have boosted nickel prices. Lumber prices have increased, driven mainly 
by wildfires in British Columbia and the western United States and poten-
tial supply disruptions caused by the hurricanes in the United States and 
the Caribbean. In contrast, agricultural prices have declined following a 
seasonal drop in livestock prices and expectations of stronger global crop 
yields.

Agricultural prices are expected to stay near current lows, while some 
modest growth in prices of base metals, excluding iron, should be sup-
ported by strong demand and ongoing declines in inventories. The Bank 
of Canada’s non-energy commodity price index is therefore expected to 
remain roughly flat over the projection horizon, given these contrasting 
underlying outlooks.

Canadian Economy

Economic activity continued to grow rapidly in the second quarter of 2017, 
exceeding expectations at the time of the July Report. Growth continued to 
be broadly based across regions and industries and has become more bal-
anced across components of aggregate demand (Chart 5). In the first half of 
the year, growth was very strong. Consumption and residential investment 
were robust, and growth in exports and business investment picked up. In 
this context, excess capacity has declined more rapidly than expected, and 
the Bank now estimates the output gap to be between -0.5 and 0.5 per cent 
in the third quarter.

Looking ahead, the level of economic activity will be supported by rising  foreign 
demand and the recent firming of commodity prices, still-accommodative 
 monetary and financial conditions, and public infrastructure spending. The 
economy is expected to progress on a more sustainable path: the total 
 contribution to growth from consumption and residential investment is 
projected to decline, in part because of recent interest rate increases, while 
the contribution from exports is expected to improve and that from business 
investment to remain steady.

The Bank’s projection incorporates the effects of three important develop-
ments since July, namely, the policy rate increases in July and September, 
the appreciation of the Canadian dollar and the increase in commodity 
prices. It also reflects the Bank’s current assessment of the following key 
issues: the level and future growth rates of potential output; the evolution of

Box 1

Canadian Infl ation: The Role of Globalization and Digitalization
The role of globalization and digitalization has received 
increasing attention among policy-makers as a potential 
explanation for soft infl ation across a number of advanced 
economies . In this context, the Bank has investigated 
whether such global factors might shed light on unexplained 
softness in Canadian infl ation in recent years .1, 2

Globalization is likely not a signifi cant contributor 
to infl ation softness
Given that Canada is a small open economy, there is con-
siderable scope for globalization to aﬀ ect Canadian infl ation . 
For example, increased imports of goods from China in the 
2000s were estimated to have reduced infl ation in Canada .3 
Globalization may infl uence infl ation through several 
channels . New analysis examining the recent unexplained 
softness in infl ation considered the impact coming through 
import prices, including the implications of global slack . 
It also explored the eﬀ ect of the integration of Canada in 
global value chains on domestic wages and price setting . 
This analysis did not detect a signifi cant link between these 
factors and the unexplained softness, although over time 
the factors could become more relevant .

The eﬀ ect of digitalization on Canadian infl ation 
appears to be small, but this could change
As noted in the July Report and in Poloz (2017), structural 
changes related to technological advances and digitalization 
could also be aﬀ ecting consumer price index (CPI) infl ation 
globally .4 Bank staﬀ  have reviewed the literature on the 
implications of digitalization for infl ation and reported on 
consultations with fi rms on the digital transformation in 
some service industries .5
This analysis reviews three key channels through which 
digital technologies may aﬀ ect infl ation:

1  See D . Brouillette and L . Savoie-Chabot, “Global Factors and Infl ation in Canada,” 

Bank of Canada Staﬀ  Analytical Note No . 2017-17 (October 2017) .

2  The Bank bases its analysis on a Phillips curve framework, where infl ation 

dynamics are explained by a measure of economic slack, infl ation expectations, 
movements in commodity prices and movements in the exchange rate .

Empirical Assessment,” Bank of Canada Staﬀ  Discussion Paper No . 2007-10

5  See W . Dong, J . Fudurich and L . Suchanek, “Digital Transformation in the Service 

•  Falling prices of goods and services related to informa-
tion and communications technology (ICT) can aﬀ ect 
the CPI. The prices of some ICT products have rapidly 
decreased since the 1990s as a result of technological 
improvements . However, the trend in Canada appears to 
be somewhat diﬀ erent, refl ecting in part limited compe-
tition in the Canadian telecommunications sector, which 
has oﬀ set some of the downward pressure on prices 
relative to other countries .6

•  Digital technologies can change market structure. 

Digital technologies can allow certain “superstar” fi rms 
to become dominant, but they can also increase com-
petition, especially through e-commerce, which may 
infl uence how retailers set prices . Evidence for Canada 
suggests the latter impact is likely limited so far because 
of the very small share of online retail sales held by 
Canadian fi rms and the similarity between the behaviour 
of online and oﬄ  ine prices .7 To the extent that technol-
ogies are substitutes for labour, they may reduce the 
bargaining power of workers and weigh on wage growth .
•  Cost-eﬃ  cient technologies lead to increases in produc-
tivity. Digital innovation can create disinfl ationary pres-
sure through a reduction in production costs . However, 
productivity eﬀ ects from digitalization are diﬃ  cult to 
identify in oﬃ  cial statistics .8 Results from the Bank’s 
consultations suggest that, on balance, fi rms have seen 
some reduction in operational costs, but eﬃ  ciencies are 
yet to be realized for many .

There is some evidence that digitalization has had a damp-
ening eﬀ ect on infl ation in advanced economies .9 However, 
its eﬀ ect on Canadian infl ation appears to be small . The 
relatively low adoption rate of e-commerce and other digital 
technologies in Canada compared with other advanced econ-
omies could be one explanation for smaller eﬀ ects in Canada .
The Bank will continue to explore the evolving role of global 
factors, particularly digitalization .

Key Inputs to the Base-Case Projection
The Bank’s projection is always conditional on several key 
assumptions, and changes to them will aﬀ ect the outlook 
for the global and Canadian economies . The Bank regularly 
reviews these assumptions and assesses the sensitivity of 
the economic projection to them .
•  Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent average 

levels . The per-barrel prices in US dollars for Brent, West 
Texas Intermediate and Western Canada Select are 
about $55, $50 and $40, respectively, about $5 higher 
than assumed in the July Report .

•  By convention, the Bank does not attempt to forecast 

the exchange rate in the base-case projection . Over the 
projection horizon, the Canadian dollar is assumed to 
remain close to its recent average of 81 cents, compared 
with the 76 cents assumed in July .

•  The Bank estimates that the output gap is in a range of -0 .5 

to 0 .5 per cent in the third quarter . For the projection, the 
output gap is assumed to be at the midpoint of this range .1 

1  The level of potential output is estimated to be about 0 .1 per cent higher in the 

second quarter than projected in the July Report, while the level of GDP is higher 
by 0 .3 per cent .

This compares with the July assumption that the output 
gap was -0 .5 per cent, the midpoint of a -1 to 0 range, in 
the second quarter of 2017 .

•  Business investment in the second quarter of 2017 
was more robust than expected, and this increased 
strength is expected to persist over the projection 
horizon . Thus, the annual growth of potential output is 
now assumed to be 1 .5 per cent over 2018–19, which 
is slightly above the assumption since April 2017 
(Table 2) . Further details on the Bank’s assessment 
of potential output are provided in the Appendix to 
the April 2017 Report, and a full reassessment will be 
presented in April 2018 .

•  The neutral nominal policy rate is defi ned as the real 

rate that is consistent with output at its potential level 
and with infl ation equal to target after the eﬀ ects of 
all cyclical shocks have dissipated, plus 2 per cent 
for the infl ation target . For Canada, the neutral rate 
is estimated to be between 2 .5 and 3 .5 per cent . The 
economic projection is based on the midpoint of this 
range, which remains unchanged . 

wages and inflation, together with the potential implications of globalization 
and technology (Box 1); and the sensitivity of the economy to interest rates 
given elevated household indebtedness.3 Over time, the Bank will update its 
judgment as appropriate with additional data. 

Largely as a result of the robust pace of growth in the first half of the year, 
real GDP is forecast to grow at 3.1 per cent in 2017. Relative to the July 
projection, growth for the year is revised up, mainly because of unexpected 
strength in household consumption and business investment in the second 
quarter. After moderating in the second half of 2017, GDP is expected to 
grow by 2.1 per cent in 2018 and 1.5 per cent in 2019 (Table 2 and Box 2). 
As such, economic activity is forecast to remain close to full capacity and 
at times possibly modestly above, depending on how the supply side of the 
economy evolves.

Consumer price index (CPI) inflation has recently picked up from low levels, 
reflecting higher gasoline prices, dissipating drag from food inflation, and 
improving economic conditions. Inflation is expected to continue to rise 
toward 2 per cent as the temporary effects of past fluctuations in food 
and electricity prices fade. Compared with the July inflation projection, the 
stronger Canadian dollar is expected to have a dampening impact in 2018, 
while the more rapid absorption of economic slack is expected to have 
an opposite, albeit smaller, effect. In this context, inflation is projected to 
increase to close to 2 per cent over the course of 2018 and to remain around 
2 per cent until the end of 2019.

Growth is still expected to moderate in the second half 
of 2017
The economy grew at a rapid pace in the first half of 2017, averaging just 
over 4 per cent growth at an annual rate (Table 3, Chart 6). This exceptional 
strength reflected robust growth in consumer spending, underpinned by 
favourable financial conditions and rising household employment and 
income. Consumption growth has become more widespread across 
regions, since the rebound in incomes in energy-producing provinces is now 
more entrenched. A broad-based expansion in business investment and a 
surge in energy exports were also contributors to growth. However, after a 
strong first quarter, housing activity pulled back in the second quarter. The 
housing decline was driven by a contraction of resale activity in the Toronto 
market, which was partly in response to the measures introduced by the 
Ontario government in April (Chart 7). Overall, real GDP growth in the first 
half of the year was widespread, with more than two-thirds of industries and 
most major demand components contributing to the expansion.

Last observation: September 2017 

Real GDP growth is expected to moderate to a still-solid pace close to 
2 per cent at an annual rate over the second half of the year as growth in 
consumption and investment slows and exports temporarily decline in the 
third quarter. Still, consumption growth is expected to remain solid, sup-
ported by ongoing growth in employment and income and elevated con-
sumer confidence. The Canada child benefit introduced in 2016 will continue 
to support the level of consumption, although the effects on growth have 
dissipated. Recent data show a decline in drilling rig activity and weakness

in imports of machinery and equipment. Nonetheless, business investment 
growth is expected to pick up later in the year, buoyed in part by the launch 
of some large projects.4

The temporary decline in exports in the third quarter is largely due to sched-
uled reductions in motor vehicle production and the unwinding of temporary 
factors that boosted growth in the spring.5 However, with the reversal of 
these temporary effects, export growth is anticipated to rebound in the 
fourth quarter, in line with foreign demand. Housing activity is estimated to 
have declined further in the third quarter, dampened by the slowdown in 
Ontario, but is expected to increase in the fourth quarter, as resales have 
recently started to pick up.

The economy is operating close to capacity
Robust growth over recent quarters has contributed to a rapid narrowing of 
the output gap, and the Bank estimates that the Canadian economy is now 
operating close to capacity (Box 2).6 This estimate incorporates an assess-
ment of the impact of strong recent investment on potential output growth. 
The robust growth of demand, combined with declining excess capacity, 
is providing an important incentive for businesses to invest and hire more 
workers. New firms could also be created, and workers could increase their 
hours worked or participation in the labour force.7 

Growth in employment has remained strong at the national level and has 
been broad-based across sectors and regions. The unemployment rate has 
continued to fall, but its decline likely overstates the degree of improvement 
in the labour market (Chart 8). In particular, the Bank’s labour market indi-
cator, a composite indicator, is still relatively high. Its current level reflects

Wage Dynamics and Infl ationary Pressures
Infl ationary pressures coming from wages are muted
The Canadian economy has benefi ted from impressive 
employment gains over the past year . Nonetheless, there 
is evidence of slack remaining in the labour market; for 
example, average hours worked, although improving, are 
still below trend .1 Other evidence of labour market slack 
comes from the Bank of Canada labour market indicator, 
which remains high relative to its level before the Great 
Recession, and from the labour force participation rate of 
youth, which remains low .
The growth of compensation per hour worked and various 
measures of wage growth also remain below their histor-
ical averages . For example, unit labour costs for both the 
total economy and the resource sector have been declining 
since 2016 (Chart 3-A) . Unit labour cost (ULC)—defi ned 
as labour compensation per hour worked divided by labour 
productivity—is viewed as a useful way to measure infl a-
tionary pressure coming from the labour market . ULC has 
declined recently because labour productivity has grown 
faster than hourly compensation (Chart 3-B) . Overall, labour 
cost pressur es are growing at a moderate pace and are 
below what would be expected at this stage of the cycle . 
Consequently, infl ationary pressures from wages remain 
muted .
Another factor that could explain the absence of wage pres-
sures is globalization .2 The possibility of relocating produc-
tion activities to low-wage countries may have reduced the 
bargaining power of workers in advanced economies and 
lowered their wage expectations . In turn, more-integrated 
global activity and openness to trade could also increase 
competition in domestic markets, which could further 
restrain the growth of domestic wages .

Labour market slack is weighing on wage growth 
Based on estimates from a wage-equation regression 
model, past labour market slack appears to be the key factor 
weighing on wage growth since 2011, with the peak impact 
of labour market slack on wage infl ation being felt after

roughly one year .3 The drag from weak labour produc-
tivity in 2015 has now dissipated, owing to the rebound 
of labour productivity over the fi rst half of 2017 . But other 
factors could also be at play . For example, workers formerly 
employed in the relatively high-paying oil and gas sector 
may have moved to lower-paid jobs in other sectors . Bank 
staﬀ  estimate that the decline in commodity prices may 
have reduced wage growth by about 0 .5 percentage points 
by mid-2016 . However, these reallocation eﬀ ects, and other 
factors holding down wage growth, appear to be fading .

3  See D . Brouillette, J . Ketcheson, O . Kostyshyna and J . Lachaine, “Wage Growth in 
Canada and the United States: Factors Behind Recent Weakness,” Bank of Canada 
Staﬀ  Analytical Note No . 2017-8 (July 2017) . Labour market slack is measured 
by the labour gap—the percentage diﬀ erence between actual total hours worked 
and trend total hours worked, based on the integrated framework approach 
to estimating potential output and the output gap . See L . Pichette, P . St-Amant, 
B . Tomlin and K . Anoma, “Measuring Potential Output at the Bank of Canada: The 
Extended Multivariate Filter and the Integrated Framework,” Bank of Canada Staﬀ  
Discussion Paper No . 2015-1 (January 2015) . 

Wage growth is expected to pick up as labour market 
slack dissipates
Wage growth is projected to increase as the eﬀ ects of past 
labour market slack continue to dissipate in coming quar-
ters . Moreover, if productivity growth remains strong, it 
could lead to higher wages, especially as the labour market 
tightens . Wage growth could potentially accelerate if labour 
shortages were to become more pervasive since, historically, 
strong wage growth has been associated with signifi cant 
excess demand in the labour market .
The recently announced increases to the minimum wage in 
Ontario and Alberta could have disproportionately higher 
eﬀ ects on the wages of younger workers . However, they are 
expected to have only a small positive impact on aggregate 
national wages .
Looking ahead, stronger wage growth should contribute to 
the expected gradual increase in infl ation over the projec-
tion horizon .

the fact that the long-term unemployment rate remains elevated, average 
hours worked remain low and wage growth continues to be modest (for 
details on wage growth dynamics, see Box 3). With recent productivity 
gains exceeding wage increases, labour cost pressures have been relatively 
low. Moreover, according to the autumn Business Outlook Survey, there 
is clear evidence of ongoing slack in energy-producing regions. As well, 
binding labour shortages appear to be prevalent only in British Columbia 
and in specific sectors.

Taken together, these developments indicate that labour markets are not yet 
a source of inflationary pressures and that opportunities for further expan-
sions of employment remain.

Inflation has increased as expected and remains below 
2 per cent
CPI inflation has increased in recent months, largely as expected. CPI inflation 
rose from a trough of 1 per cent in June to 1.6 per cent in September, mostly 
reflecting dynamics in gasoline prices. Hurricane Harvey’s disruption of refining 
capacity temporarily boosted gasoline prices and, thus, inflation by 0.2 per-
centage points in September. Additional contributors to the recent rise in CPI 
inflation were the fading effects of factors such as weak inflation in food prices 
and dissipating economic slack. However, these two factors, together with the 
electricity rebates in Ontario, still contribute to keeping CPI inflation below the 
2 per cent target. Moreover, the recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar is 
estimated to reduce projected inflation. Several other factors, including digital-
ization, may be having some dampening impact on inflation (Box 1).

Inflation in the second half of 2017 is expected to be similar on average 
to that forecast in July. The impact of the change in the exchange rate is 
slightly greater, while that from economic slack is slightly less.

Core inflation measures also started to drift upward in recent months, 
consistent with declining slack in the past and the diminishing drag from 
weak food inflation. The range of core measures was 1.5 to 1.8 per cent in 
September (Chart 9). These levels are roughly consistent with estimates of 
the evolution of excess capacity over previous quarters.

Monetary and financial conditions are somewhat less 
stimulative
Financial conditions for both households and businesses remain broadly 
stimulative but have become less so since the middle of this year (Chart 10). 
Market interest rates have risen, partly reflecting improvements in economic 
conditions in Canada and related increases in the Bank’s policy rate in July 
and September.

The rise in bank funding costs prompted financial institutions to raise 
mortgage and consumer credit rates. For example, five-year fixed mortgage 
rates have increased by about 50 basis points since the July Report. The 
estimated effective rate for businesses has increased by about 50 basis 
points since early June, in line with business prime rates. In that context, 
the Bank’s Business Outlook Survey and Senior Loan Officer Survey both 
report that, aside from the overall increase in interest rates, business lending 
conditions were broadly unchanged during the third quarter of 2017.8 The 
surveys noted that recent healthy firm performance and competition among 
lenders helped ease non-price borrowing conditions for businesses, while 
some firms in commodity and related industries saw a modest rise in bor-
rowing costs.

The Canadian dollar has appreciated against the US dollar, reflecting higher 
commodity prices, narrower US–Canada interest rate spreads and the 
weaker US dollar. The US dollar remains somewhat lower than it was in July, 
despite firming in recent weeks.

8  Both surveys define the cost of credit as spreads over base rates rather than as the level of rates.

GDP growth is expected to moderate to a more 
sustainable pace
The Bank projects that economic growth will slow and quarterly growth 
rates will average close to potential growth over 2018–19 (Table 3). The 
composition of GDP growth is anticipated to remain relatively balanced. 
Solid growth of foreign demand is expected to support export growth and 
promote business investment. Consumption and residential investment 
are projected to moderate as households respond to less-accommodative 
financial conditions and as macroprudential and other housing policy 
measures continue to weigh on activity in the housing market. Government 
spending is expected to boost growth over the coming quarters, reflecting 
previously announced fiscal measures.9

Economic growth is expected to remain broad-based across sectors. The 
solid expansion of the service sector is projected to continue, and the recent 
strength in goods-producing industries is now more entrenched (Chart 11). 
Results from the Business Outlook Survey also suggest that strong indica-
tors of future sales remain widespread across regions and sectors (Chart 12).

9  The Bank’s scenario also incorporates measures announced since the July 2017 Report, including the 
new spending measures contained in the British Columbia budget update. Moreover, the persistently 
weaker-than-expected data for government infrastructure spending suggest a more modest pickup in 
the current year and, therefore, a smaller payback thereafter than was projected in July.

The recovery in business investment is becoming more 
entrenched
After rebounding in the first part of 2017, business investment is expected to 
grow at a more moderate, but steady, pace over the projection period. With 
the economy operating close to capacity, ongoing increases in household 
and foreign demand, solid profit margins and robust business confidence 
are expected to support growth in business investment (Chart 13 and 
Chart 14). Results from the autumn Business Outlook Survey indicate that 
while intentions to increase investment spending have come down from 
recent high levels, they remain widespread across sectors and regions.10

Data on business investment may not fully capture firm expenditures to 
increase capacity and productivity. For example, spending on cloud com-
puting or other information technology infrastructure services is often treated 
as an operating expense rather than as an investment per se. Yet, such 
innovation may lead to stronger productivity and potential output for a given 
level of investment spending. The results of both the Business Outlook Survey 
and consultations conducted by the Bank indicate that businesses expect to 
continue to focus on digital technologies to grow their productive capacity.11

The firming of global commodity prices and the improvement in the bal-
ance sheets of oil and gas companies will support a gradual expansion of 
commodity-related investment, but growth prospects are limited, given the 
assumed outlook for oil prices (Box 2). Non-commodity business investment 
is expected to expand with the growth of demand in Canada’s major trading 
partners. Nevertheless, uncertainty about US trade policy and structural

challenges, including expected low trend labour force and productivity 
growth in Canada relative to history, are expected to continue to restrain 
investment growth.12

Exports are anticipated to grow in line with foreign demand
As expected in July, Canadian export growth has shown temporary 
weakness in recent months, partly due to the expected retrenchment in 
automobile production in the third quarter. Over the projection, exports 
are anticipated to grow roughly in line with strengthening foreign demand 
(Chart 15). The growth of imports is expected to slow with decelerating 
domestic demand. However, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth 
over 2018 and 2019 is slightly weaker than anticipated in the July Report 
following the recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar.

Over the past year, the growth of exports of services, driven by transporta-
tion and travel services, has been solid and should continue at a similar 
pace. Non-commodity goods exports have also picked up recently, and 
several goods components, including industrial machinery and equip-
ment, plastics and rubber products, and food and beverage products, are 
expected to benefit from global growth.

As a result of several ongoing challenges, the growth of non-commodity 
goods exports is expected to remain moderate. Deteriorating competitive-
ness and the relocation of production outside Canada by some multinational 
firms have contributed to a loss of productive capacity and a reduction 
in the global market share of Canadian goods exporters. An important 

12  The effect of this uncertainty is projected to reduce investment growth by about 0.7 percentage points 

and subtract about 0.2 percentage points from Canadian export growth in both 2017 and 2018.

example is recent developments in the auto industry. Uncertainty about pro-
posed trade measures and the status of trade agreements is also assumed 
to be hindering Canada’s ability to benefit from an improving global outlook.

Growth of commodity exports is expected to be modest over the next two 
years, since production and exports have been restrained by limited invest-
ment in new capacity in the sector in recent years. Over the longer term, 
these exports could grow more strongly if commodity prices increased 
further and investment and productive capacity expand.

Household spending is expected to slow
Consumption growth is projected to moderate and residential investment is 
expected to contract modestly over 2018–19. Several factors are expected 
to weigh on household spending, notably, an anticipated slowdown in the 
growth of disposable income (Chart 16). Moreover, while financial condi-
tions remain broadly stimulative, higher interest rates have increased 
the cost of new borrowing and of servicing outstanding debt. The higher 
borrowing costs are likely to dampen household spending, particularly on 
durable goods and housing. Given higher overall debt levels, such spending 
is expected to be more sensitive to interest rate changes than in previous 
cycles (see the Appendix for a description of recent changes to the model-
ling of household consumption and debt). While higher interest rates on con-
sumer credit, home equity lines of credit and variable-rate mortgages affect 
borrowers immediately, the impact of the recent rate increases on holders 
of fixed-rate mortgages will be gradual. Mortgages with fixed rates of three 
to five years represent a large share of the total debt of households, and 
income gains should help fixed-rate mortgage holders to continue servicing 
their debt at renewal.13

13  In particular, at current interest rates, households with five-year fixed-rate mortgages can renegotiate 
at a lower rate than at origination, and most of those renewing over the projection horizon are likely to 
experience a lower debt-service ratio, mostly because of cumulative income gains. These mortgage-
holders are thus well positioned to adapt to higher mortgage rates.

Other factors are also expected to weigh on housing activity. The level of 
housing starts is projected to decrease in the coming years, in line with 
an anticipated gradual slowing of population growth. Moreover, macro-
prudential and other housing policy measures, while contributing to more 
sustainable debt profiles going forward, are also expected to weigh on 
housing demand. In particular, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions (OSFI) recently announced new guidelines aimed at reinforcing 
residential mortgage underwriting practices. These guidelines are expected 
to subtract about 0.2 per cent from the level of GDP by the end of 2019.14 
Taken together, recent interest rate increases and macroprudential policy 
changes are likely to have a moderating influence on residential investment 
as some prospective homebuyers respond by taking on smaller mortgages 
while others delay purchases.

CPI inflation is expected to increase to around 2 per cent
CPI inflation is anticipated to average 1.4 per cent in the fourth quarter and 
to move up to around 2 per cent in the second half of 2018, staying close to 
the target thereafter (Table 3 and Chart 17).

In the base-case projection, the gradual increase in projected inflation 
primarily reflects the unwinding of temporary factors. Downward pressures 
from below-average growth in food prices should completely dissipate by 
the beginning of 2018, while those from the electricity rebates in Ontario 
should last until the middle of the year. After subtracting an estimated 
0.2 percentage points from inflation in the second half of 2017, pass-through 
effects of the stronger Canadian dollar are expected to become stronger, 
with a peak impact on inflation of -0.5 percentage points in the second 
quarter of 2018, before fading by the end of 2018.

14  OSFI published its review of Guideline B20, Residential Mortgage Underwriting Practices and 

Procedures, on October 17. The new guidelines take effect January 1, 2018. The Bank’s estimate of the 
effects of these guidelines incorporates model simulations and historical experience following changes 
to housing regulations. There is considerable uncertainty around the overall impact of these measures 
on the economy because it is difficult to forecast the change in behaviour of borrowers and lenders.

This projection is consistent with medium- and long-term inflation expecta-
tions remaining well anchored. The September 2017 Consensus Economics 
forecast for CPI inflation is 1.6 per cent in 2017 and 1.9 per cent in 2018. A 
quarterly question on long-term inflation expectations shows an average of 
2 per cent through 2027.

Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, a reasonable range 
around the base-case projection for CPI inflation is ±0.3 percentage points. 
This range is intended to convey a sense of forecast uncertainty. A comple-
mentary perspective is provided using statistical analysis of the Bank’s fore-
cast errors, which suggests that a 50 per cent confidence interval around 
the base-case projection widens from ±0.3 percentage points in the fourth 
quarter of 2017 to ±0.6 percentage points by the end of 2019. Over the same 
period, a 90 per cent confidence band widens from ±0.6 to ±1.5 percentage 
points.

Summary of key projection issues
The Canadian economy is operating close to capacity, and inflation is 
expected to increase to close to 2 per cent over the next several quarters. In 
this context, the Bank is focusing on assessing the importance of four key 
issues.

  The Bank is assessing the extent to which potential growth increases with 

strong demand, given that the economy is close to capacity. The base-
case projection incorporates some effect of strong demand growth on 
potential.

  Global and technological factors have lowered inflation in advanced 

economies in recent years. Their impact on Canadian inflation to date 
does not appear to be significant, but work in this area continues. In the 
Bank’s projection, the dynamics of inflation in Canada reflect the tem-
porary effects of sector-specific factors, exchange rate pass-through and 
the evolution of economic slack.

  Despite recent labour market improvements, wage gains remain subdued 

and are likely to increase only gradually. The projection builds in scope 
for greater labour market participation and hours worked before wage 
increases would add meaningful upward pressure on inflation. 

  Finally, household spending is being influenced by high levels of house-

hold debt and various macroprudential and other measures targeting the 
housing market. The Bank’s main policy model has been revised to reflect 
that households are more responsive to interest rates when they are 
carrying elevated debt loads. The projection also incorporates estimates 
of the effects of the new housing measures. 

The Bank will continue to monitor all of these issues, given their significance 
for the inflation outlook.

Appendix: Recent changes to ToTEM
The Terms-of-Trade Economic Model (ToTEM) is the Bank of Canada’s main 
policy model. Since its creation in 2005, ToTEM has undergone two large-
scale updates to incorporate advances in economic modelling, effectively 
expanding the range of policy questions that can be answered with the 
model. The first update (ToTEM II) was completed in 2011 and included the 
introduction of multiple interest rates and a more general structure of price- 
and wage-setting behaviour.15 The second update (ToTEM III) is taking place 
this year. The new elements of the model consistently link higher levels of 
household indebtedness with a stronger response of output and consump-
tion to interest rate changes, mainly because of variations in borrowers’ 
consumption. This appendix briefly describes the most important changes 
included in ToTEM III.

Improved modelling of household debt
While the Bank has already incorporated household debt into two of its 
models that focus on financial stability issues (MP2, the Macroprudential 
and Monetary Policy Model, and HRAM, the Household Risk Assessment 
Model), ToTEM III represents the first effort to incorporate household debt 
into the Bank’s main policy model.16 More specifically, ToTEM III integrates 
the following key elements related to household debt.17

Households that borrow: In previous versions of ToTEM, a prominent role 
was given to a group of households that have accumulated wealth and use 
their savings to smooth their consumption (savers). ToTEM III now includes 
borrower households whose importance is roughly similar to that of savers. 
Borrowers differ from savers in their degree of impatience, with the former 
placing a relatively greater weight on present consumption than on future 
consumption. In equilibrium, this leads to a situation where borrowers 
finance some of their spending by receiving loans from savers.

Stock-flow dynamics: Household debt is assumed to evolve with principal 
payments and new loans. Principal payments are based on a constant 
amortization rate of loans over a horizon that is in line with the data.

Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and home equity extraction: A collateral con-
straint in ToTEM III establishes that new loans to borrowers are equal to 
the sum of two components: (i) the value of their new housing investments 
multiplied by the current LTV ratio, plus (ii) a given share of their current 
home equity. The first component is meant to capture mortgages, while the 
second aims to capture home equity lines of credit. The model thus incor-
porates most forms of collateralized household debt observed in the data, 
which together account for more than 80 per cent of total household debt in 
Canada.

15  See J. Dorich, M. K. Johnston, R. R. Mendes, S. Murchison and Y. Zhang, “ToTEM II: An Updated 

Version of the Bank of Canada’s Quarterly Projection Model,” Bank of Canada Technical Report 
No. 100 (October 2013). 

16  Information about MP2 and HRAM can be found in S. Alpanda, G. Cateau and C. Meh, “A Policy Model 

to Analyze Macroprudential Regulations and Monetary Policy,” Bank of Canada Staff Working Paper 
No. 2014-6 (February 2014); and B. Peterson and T. Roberts, “Household Risk Assessment Model,” 
Bank of Canada Technical Report No. 106 (September 2016).

17  ToTEM II did not incorporate borrower activity. As a result, there was no treatment of stock-flow 

dynamics, loan-to-value ratio or home equity extraction, or of a mix of fixed and variable rates on 
outstanding debt.

 
 

banK oF CanaDa  •  MonEtaRy PoliCy REPoRt  •  oCtobER 2017

CanaDian EConoMy  25 

Mix of fixed and variable rates: The effective interest rate for borrowers is 
a weighted average of the effective rate for the previous period and the rate 
paid on new loans. This feature allows the model to capture the mix of fixed- 
and variable-rate collateralized debt observed in the data.

A more detailed modelling of the housing market
ToTEM III also features a more elaborate structure of the housing market. On 
the demand side, the main innovation is that borrowers now contribute to 
overall housing demand, allowing mortgage debt to influence house prices. 
Moreover, since house prices affect the collateral constraint through their 
impact on housing investment and home equity, the model also incorporates 
a channel through which house prices affect household debt.

At the same time, the supply side of the model now includes a sector spe-
cifically for producing residential investment goods. This modification allows 
the model to track the residential investment price deflator, which was not 
the case in ToTEM II.18 Further, housing in ToTEM III is constructed by com-
bining residential structures and land. This assumption helps to establish a 
relationship linking house prices with the price of residential investment and 
the price of land.19

Enhanced estimation method
Most parameters in ToTEM III have been estimated using Bayesian meth-
odology, which allows Bank staff to incorporate information from microdata 
and other sources. In contrast, the majority of parameters in ToTEM II were 
estimated using classical maximum likelihood methods.

Improved measures of the determinants of non-commodity 
exports
Canadian non-commodity exports are influenced by the real exchange rate 
and the level of foreign activity. Over the last two years, Bank staff have 
developed improved measures of these variables—the CEER (Canadian 
effective exchange rate) and GRACE (global real activity for Canadian 
exports).20 With these new measures now included in ToTEM III, the model 
better explains the recent dynamics of non-commodity exports.

18  In ToTEM II, residential investment goods were produced and supplied by the consumption sector, so 
there was no difference in the consumption price deflator and the residential investment price deflator. 
19  In contrast, in ToTEM II, house prices were set by using a reduced-form equation that aimed to capture 

the supply side.

RisKs to thE inFlation outlooK  27 

Risks to the inflation outlook

The prospect of a notable shift toward protectionist global trade policies 
is the most important source of uncertainty affecting the outlook. Recent 
developments, such as the use of targeted discretionary measures by the 
United States, are increasing uncertainty about the status of current and 
future trade agreements. However, the Bank has chosen not to fully quantify 
the implications of more-protectionist policies. More clarity is needed in 
order to narrow the range of possibilities, particularly regarding the specific 
details and timing of any policy changes. Nevertheless, as in July, the Bank 
attempts to better balance the risks around the outlook by incorporating at 
least some of the adverse impact of the elevated global uncertainty into the 
base case.

Aside from the uncertainty around global trade policies, the Bank’s outlook 
for inflation is subject to several upside and downside risks originating from 
both the external environment and the domestic economy. Overall, the 
Bank assesses that the risks to the projected path for Canadian inflation 
are roughly balanced. As in past reports, the focus is on a selection of risks 
identified as the most important, drawing from a larger set of risks con-
sidered in the forecast.

The evolution of risks since July is summarized in Table 4. The risk of 
weaker exports and sluggish business investment in Canada has been 
modified to focus on the possibility of increased protectionist pressures and 
competitiveness challenges. As in July, the risk of higher potential output 
is discussed in conjunction with the risk of persistent weakness in inflation, 
highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the effects of structural factors and 
prolonged excess supply on inflation.21

(i)  A shift toward protectionist trade policies and weaker 

Canadian exports
While the future of US trade policy is still unknown, a protectionist 
shift in the United States is already evident in several discretionary 
decisions. For example, the US administration has imposed 
countervailing duties on Canadian aircraft, and uncertainty around 
the outcome of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) 
renegotiations is elevated. Other negative effects are also possible 
if additional US measures are implemented.22 Although the Bank’s 
projection for exports is cautious, there is a risk that exports will fall 
short of expectations, given the growing protectionist pressures and 

21  The risks of higher global long-term interest rates and higher commodity prices mentioned in past 

reports are not highlighted here but are still being monitored.

22  The range of possibilities is wide, and the channels through which the measures would affect the 

economy are complex. See Box 1 of the April 2017 Monetary Policy Report.

continuing competitiveness challenges.23 In this context, firms may 
respond to the growth of foreign demand by expanding their offshore 
production capacity rather than exporting from Canada. This move-
ment offshore could lead to an additional drag on Canadian exports 
and business investment, since firms would hold back on expanding 
domestic capacity.

(ii)  A larger impact of structural factors and prolonged excess 

supply on inflation
While many of the tame inflationary pressures in Canada and most 
advanced economies in recent years can be accounted for by eco-
nomic slack and temporary factors, global structural factors may 
be playing a larger role than currently believed (Box 1). As well, the 
trajectory of potential output could be higher than anticipated. As 
the economy approaches full capacity, business investment could 
rise by more than expected, and stronger economic activity could 
lead to the return of workers who had left the labour force or were 
underemployed. While significant uncertainty surrounds these effects, 
the level of potential output could be as much as 1 per cent higher 
than expected by the end of 2020.24 The stronger these effects are, 
the more likely firmer economic growth could be generated without 
creating additional inflationary pressures relative to the base case.

Uncertainty also surrounds the persistence of the effect of past 
excess supply on inflation and whether the relationship between the 
output gap and inflation has weakened.

(iii)  Stronger real GDP growth in the United States

Efforts toward deregulation and prospects for sizable federal cor-
porate and personal tax cuts in the United States could boost US 
economic growth. Deregulation, if it enhances competitiveness in 
an environment of accommodative financial conditions, elevated 
equity prices and corporate profits, could help trigger “animal spirits.” 
A further improvement in business confidence could lead to an 
acceleration in the pace of investment, firm creation, innovation and 
productivity growth. In addition, potential tax cuts could provide a 
modest boost to consumption and investment growth, although the 
precise effects will depend on the timing, magnitude and distribution 
of any cuts. Stronger US household spending and public and private 
investment would have positive spillovers for Canadian business con-
fidence, investment and exports.

(iv)  Stronger consumption and rising household debt in Canada

Strong spending, combined with elevated consumer confidence, 
points to underlying strength. While recent data on motor vehicle and 
retail sales indicate a slowdown in the coming quarters, the recent 
strength of consumption could persist if growth in wages and house-
hold incomes were to increase faster than expected as the labour 
market approaches full employment. Moreover, the recent robust 
credit growth could last longer than anticipated. This would provide a 

23  For example, the impact of trade restrictions on softwood lumber exports is incorporated into the 

base case.

boost to economic activity, but it could further exacerbate the macro-
economic and financial vulnerabilities associated with high household 
indebtedness.

(v)  A pronounced drop in house prices in overheated markets
Imbalances in the Canadian housing market remain an important vul-
nerability, particularly in the greater Toronto and Vancouver areas.25 In 
the context of elevated levels of consumer indebtedness, households 
could be even more sensitive to interest rate increases than assumed 
in the base case, which could trigger an adjustment in house prices 
in regions with elevated valuations. A large regional decline in house 
prices would have important adverse effects on residential invest-
ment and on related consumption and real estate services in the 
affected regions. Such a fall in house prices could further weigh on 
consumption through negative wealth and collateral effects. Overall, 
a pronounced decline in house prices in some regions could have a 
material negative impact on the economic outlook in those regions, 
with modest direct spillovers to the rest of the country.

Monetary Policy Report

– April 2020 –

“ This Report will provide an account of our 

stewardship of monetary policy and will be useful for 
those who want to know more about monetary policy 
for their own decision-making.”

—former Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen

On March 30, 1995, Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen delivered 
the HERMES-Glendon Lecture, entitled “Uncertainty and the Transmission 
of Monetary Policy in Canada.” In it, Governor Thiessen argued, “Given its 
importance, uncertainty deserves much greater prominence than it typically 
receives.”

He also announced that the Bank of Canada would publish a biannual 
Monetary Policy Report starting in May 1995. This was part of a series of 
efforts to “reduce one kind of uncertainty—the uncertainty that may exist 
about the Bank’s behaviour—with the objective of improving the operation of 
financial markets and of the economy more generally.” 

He stated simply, “This Report will provide an account of our stewardship of 
monetary policy and will be useful for those who want to know more about 
monetary policy for their own decision-making.”

In the introduction of that first Monetary Policy Report, the Bank wrote, “The 
ultimate objective of Canadian monetary policy is to promote good overall 
economic performance. Monetary policy can contribute to this goal by 
preserving confidence in the value of money through price stability.”

Twenty-five years later, despite the unprecedented uncertainty we are living 
through today, the Bank’s commitment to that objective has not wavered. 
And the Monetary Policy Report stays true to its simple goal, even in the 
most difficult of times.

To commemorate 25 years of the Monetary Policy Report, we have repro-
duced the original May 1995 cover, showing Canada’s first silver dollar, 
struck in 1935 and featuring the evocative design of sculptor Emanuel Hahn.

Canada’s Inﬂ ation-Control Strategy1
Inﬂ ation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote 

the economic and fi nancial well-being of Canadians.

pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s 
outlook, including risks to the projection, are published four 
times per year in the Monetary Policy Report.

  Canada’s experience with infl ation targeting since 1991 has 

shown that the best way to foster confi dence in the value 
of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth, 
employment gains and improved living standards is by keeping 
infl ation low, stable and predictable.

Inﬂ ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible
  Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which 

means that the Bank is equally concerned about infl ation rising 
above or falling below the 2 percent target.

  In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 

Canada’s infl ation-control target for a further fi ve-year period, 
ending December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the 
consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 percent midpoint 
of the control range of 1 to 3 percent.

  Canada’s infl ation-targeting framework is fl exible. Typically, 

the Bank seeks to return infl ation to target over a horizon of six 
to eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for 
returning infl ation to target will vary depending on the nature 
and persistence of the shocks buffeting the economy.

The monetary policy instrument
  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes in the 

target for the overnight rate of interest.2 These changes are 
transmitted to the economy through their infl uence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate, 
which affect total demand for Canadian goods and services. 
The balance between this demand and the economy’s 
production capacity is, over time, the primary determinant of 
infl ation pressures in the economy.

  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight 
quarters—to work their way through the economy and have 
their full effect on infl ation. For this reason, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent com-
munications, the Bank regularly reports its perspective on 
the forces at work on the economy and their implications for 
infl ation. The Monetary Policy Report is a key element of this 
approach. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight 

Monitoring inﬂ ation
  In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in 
indirect taxes such as GST, can cause sizable fl uctuations in 
CPI.

  In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through 

such transitory movements in CPI infl ation and focuses on a 
set of “core” infl ation measures that better refl ect the under-
lying trend of infl ation. In this sense, these measures act as an 
operational guide to help the Bank achieve the CPI infl ation 
target. They are not a replacement for CPI infl ation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl ation are CPI-
trim, which excludes CPI components whose rates of change 
in a given month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which 
corresponds to the price change located at the 50th percentile 
(in terms of basket weight) of the distribution of price changes; 
and CPI-common, which uses a statistical procedure to track 
common price changes across categories in the CPI basket.

Infl ation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide additional  monetary 

stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website, 
describes these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Overview 

The COVID-19 pandemic presents an extremely serious, worldwide threat 

to human health and well-being. It has already had tragic consequences 

for many thousands of people. The measures required to limit the spread 

of the virus mean that a large share of economic activity has been shut 

down or scaled back. This deep contraction has brought widespread hard-

ship through losses in jobs and business incomes. Until the outbreak is 

contained, a substantial proportion of economic activity will be affected.     

The suddenness of these effects has created shockwaves in financial mar-

kets, leading to a general flight to safety, a sharp repricing of risky assets 

and a breakdown in the functioning of many markets. The fall in commod-

ity prices, particularly the plunge in the global price of oil, is also weighing 

significantly on the Canadian economy. 

In the face of these adverse economic and financial shocks, which are un-

precedented in scale, the uncertainty surrounding the outlook is excep-

tionally high. While the global and Canadian economies are expected to 

rebound once the medical emergency ends, the timing and strength of the 

recovery will depend heavily on how the pandemic unfolds and what 

measures are required to contain it. The recovery will also depend on how 

households and businesses behave in response. None of these can be 

forecast with any degree of confidence.   

In the current environment, decisive and timely policy actions, as well as 

clear communications, are critical. Policy-makers globally have rapidly de-

ployed bold measures to mitigate the economic fallout. Governments have 

announced massive fiscal packages to provide resources to fight the pan-

demic and help households and businesses navigate the economic down-

turn. Central banks have taken measures to support the functioning of 

core financial markets and provide liquidity to financial institutions, includ-

ing making large-scale asset purchases and sharply lowering interest rates. 

This support has helped address immediate liquidity problems globally. 

Still, credit conditions are likely to remain strained for some time due to 

heightened uncertainty and concerns about credit risk. These aggressive 

fiscal, monetary and financial measures, however, are laying the 

OVERVIEW

foundation for a sustained economic recovery as the virus recedes and au-

thorities relax control measures.   

Given the rapidly evolving situation and high degree of uncertainty, the 

Bank of Canada has departed from the usual format for the Monetary 

Policy Report. This special edition examines critical international develop-

ments in light of the COVID-19 crisis, rather than providing a compre-

hensive overview of recent economic data. The focus is on assessing the 

overall economic impact of the pandemic for Canada and identifying the 

channels through which it is likely to affect the economy. Given the un-

certainty surrounding the outlook, the Bank has decided not to present a 

base-case projection in this Report. As a result, the standard tables the 

Bank normally includes to present the breakdown of the projection for 

global economic growth and the contributions to the growth of Canada’s 

annual real gross domestic product (GDP) are also omitted from this Re-

port. In addition, the regular April updates of estimates of potential out-

put growth and the neutral nominal policy rate are deferred to the Octo-

ber 2020 Report. 

Instead, this Report presents analysis of the factors that could favour or 

hamper the eventual recovery. It also discusses how the recovery, when it 

comes, may play out and how it can be influenced by policy actions. Since 

the path of the virus and the length and breadth of the containment ef-

forts are highly uncertain, illustrative scenarios are used to represent a 

range of possibilities.

GLOBAL ECONOMY 
BANK OF CANADA | MONETARY POLICY REPORT | APRIL 2020 

Global Economy 

The global economy is experiencing a sharp and 
sudden contraction 
COVID-19 began disrupting global economic activity just as growth was 
stabilizing. In the months before the outbreak, the Phase One trade agree-
ment between the United States and China had sparked modest optimism. 
Survey data suggested that growth in the manufacturing sector was im-
proving in the United States and China. Supported by strong labour mar-
kets, the service sector had been growing at a healthy pace worldwide.     

Measures required to control the spread of COVID-19 have caused a se-
vere reduction in economic activity. The sudden closure of many busi-
nesses and the sharp fall in trade have prompted major disruptions to 
global supply chains (Chart 1). The resulting increase in unemployment has 
been unprecedented and has contributed to a drop in income. This, com-
bined with elevated indebtedness and the abrupt deterioration in business 
and household confidence, is weighing heavily on a wide range of eco-
nomic activities. A sharp contraction in the global economy in the first half 
of the year is unavoidable. 

4 GLOBAL ECONOMY 

BANK OF CANADA | MONETARY POLICY REPORT | APRIL 2020 

Timing of the recovery will vary across regions 

COVID-19 has spread over time around the world, and not all countries 
are at the same stage of the outbreak (Chart 2). Likewise, different regions 
are expected to recover at different points in time. This asynchronous pro-
cess will likely make the global recovery gradual. 

In China, the first country affected by COVID-19, the spread of the virus 
had slowed markedly by early March due to strict measures to control it. 
China has since relaxed some of these measures, and economic activity is 
improving. The virus is still spreading in Europe, North America and many 
other regions. The timing of the recovery will vary across economies ac-
cording to the severity of the outbreak and the measures taken to control 
it. 

In all economies, activity is expected to partially rebound once measures 
to control the virus are relaxed, but a full recovery will take time. Business 
will restart in stages, and people will gradually return to work. However, 
the loss of income and the hit to confidence are anticipated to slow the 
recovery. In the goods-producing sectors, production lines will likely oper-
ate below capacity for some time due to disruptions in supply chains. Sim-
ilarly, global trade is expected to remain weak until COVID-19 is under 
control around the world. The rebound in many service sectors—particu-
larly travel, tourism and entertainment—could be tempered by ongoing 
concerns about any activity that involves large gatherings. 

5

GLOBAL ECONOMY 
BANK OF CANADA | MONETARY POLICY REPORT | APRIL 2020 

The nascent recovery in China will serve as a case study for the expected 
upturn in other regions. The recent reopening of factories should lead to a 
rebound in China’s industrial production in the second quarter. However, 
while road and subway traffic is recovering on weekdays, it is well below 
normal levels on weekends. This suggests that households are still cau-
tious about resuming normal activities. 

The actions policy-makers around the world are taking will have an im-
portant influence on the pace and durability of the global recovery. Policy 
actions have varied across countries but have had the common goals of 
helping households and businesses weather the pandemic and minimizing 
any long-term damage to their respective domestic economies.1 

The global financial system is under extreme stress 
The prospect of a severe contraction in global growth has led investors 
to sell risky assets and purchase only the safest financial products or in-
crease cash buffers. Volatility has spiked to very high levels, and there 
have been signs of stress in core funding markets. Investment funds have 
seen significant outflows, particularly those related to equities, emerg-
ing-market assets and corporate bonds. Further, there is increased pres-
sure on the supply of US-dollar funding in foreign markets. This has con-
tributed to sharp declines in equity prices, impaired functioning of many 
financial markets and a widening in corporate and emerging-market 
credit spreads (Chart 3). While the tightening of corporate credit condi-
tions is broad-based, it has been particularly pronounced in the North 
American energy sector given the steep decline in oil prices. Persistently 
tight credit conditions could significantly limit the pace of recovery for 
highly indebted businesses and vulnerable emerging-market economies 
even after COVID-19 is under control. 

The search for safer assets, primarily in US dollars, has resulted in a sharp 
drop in the government bond yields of many economies and an apprecia-
tion of the US dollar against other currencies, including the Canadian dol-
lar. The fall in commodity prices has also contributed to the depreciation 
of the Canadian dollar.   

To alleviate pressures in market functioning, increase liquidity in core 
funding markets and help maintain the flow of credit, central banks have 
taken actions that have been unprecedented in both their scale and speed. 
These include measures to ease short-term funding costs, such as in-
creased repo operations against a wider set of eligible collateral, large-
scale purchases of government bonds to reduce pressure on long-term 
funding costs, and targeted programs to purchase assets. In addition, 

1  For a full set of government policy responses around the world, see Policy Responses to COVID-19, 

International Monetary Fund. 

6

GLOBAL ECONOMY 
BANK OF CANADA | MONETARY POLICY REPORT | APRIL 2020 

there has been a coordinated response from major central banks, includ-
ing the Bank of Canada, to improve the provision of liquidity by expanding 
standing US-dollar swap arrangements.     

Commodity prices have decreased sharply, espe-
cially for oil   
Commodity prices have decreased sharply as global growth prospects 
have worsened. The declines were largest for energy commodities and 
were significant across base metals, forestry and agriculture products 
(Chart 4). 

Prices of global crude oil have fallen 50 to 60 percent since the middle of 
January. Most of the decline in prices reflects actual or expected reduc-
tions in oil consumption due to the negative effects of COVID-19 on 
global economic activity. Competition for market share, likely prompted by 
the collapse in demand, also contributed to the decline in oil prices. In 
early March, major oil producers had announced plans to significantly in-
crease supply after members of the Organization of the Petroleum Export-
ing Countries (OPEC) and some other non-OPEC oil producers failed to 
agree to extend production limits. At the time of writing, however, these 
producers had reached an agreement to reduce supply by about 10 mil-
lion barrels per day in May and June relative to October 2018 production 
levels.   

GLOBAL ECONOMY 
BANK OF CANADA | MONETARY POLICY REPORT | APRIL 2020

Oil prices should rise as global economic activity and oil consumption nor-
malize. However, the recovery in prices is expected to be gradual given 
that oil inventories should remain elevated for some time. In particular, 
prices could stay low if oil demand for air transportation purposes remains 
persistently below its pre-pandemic level. A large reduction in supply by 
producers facing financial pressures would put oil prices on a higher path. 

The price of Western Canadian Select (WCS) has also declined dramatically 
and is close to 90 percent lower than in January. The spread between the 
per-barrel prices of West Texas Intermediate and WCS narrowed to less 
than US$15 in March but has widened more recently. Increased pipeline 
capacity, along with the anticipation of weaker supply growth in the cur-
rent low-price environment, should ease transportation constraints.2 

                                                 

2  Projects to increase pipeline capacity have been completed in recent months, including the Cana-

dian section of Enbridge’s Line 3 Replacement Program and the optimization of its Mainline system.

CANADIAN ECONOMY 
BANK OF CANADA | MONETARY POLICY REPORT | APRIL 2020 

Canadian Economy 

COVID-19 and the collapse in oil prices are having 
an unprecedented economic impact 
Before COVID-19 struck Canada, the economy had been operating close 
to potential for nearly two years and inflation was at target (Chart 5). The 
labour market was healthy: unemployment was low, and the pace of wage 
increases was picking up. While energy-intensive regions faced challenges 
and household debt was elevated, economic activity overall was on rela-
tively solid footing. That underlying resilience will help support the Cana-
dian economy through this difficult period and the subsequent recovery. 

Canada’s economy now faces two significant and related shocks. 

First, the COVID-19 pandemic is having a dramatic effect on economic ac-
tivity and employment. The near-term economic impact in Canada primar-
ily reflects the measures that authorities are implementing to control the 
spread of the virus. As in other countries, a significant amount of eco-
nomic activity in Canada has been shut down, causing sudden and sharp 
drops in both supply (e.g., closed businesses) and demand (e.g., 

CANADIAN ECONOMY 
BANK OF CANADA | MONETARY POLICY REPORT | APRIL 2020

consumers at home) as well as in income for households and firms. Uncer-
tainty about the duration and severity of the outbreak is affecting the 
spending decisions of both households and businesses. In addition, se-
verely depressed foreign activity is pulling down Canadian exports and in-
vestment, as well as our terms of trade, through lower commodity prices. 

Second, layered on top of the direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic is 
the plunge in global oil prices, which will weigh heavily on the Canadian 
economy. In particular, the recent drop in prices has dealt a major setback 
to the oil and gas sector. Production and investment in the sector have de-
clined sharply and will remain low, and could deteriorate further if prices 
remain well below levels prevailing earlier in the year (Chart 6).3 

 

The effects of COVID-19, combined with the oil price decline, have led 
businesses to reduce hours and lay off workers at an unprecedented rate 
and to cut investment, leading to self-reinforcing cuts in household in-
come and spending (Chart 7). In March, more than one million jobs were 
lost across Canada and over two million workers reported working fewer 
than usual hours or none at all. Fewer hours worked and lower productiv-
ity mean that capacity in the Canadian economy will decline sharply and 
may recover only gradually. The effects of these two shocks and related 

                                                 

3  Industry consultations conducted in March 2020 and summarized in the spring Business Outlook 

Survey indicate that investment in the oil and gas sector will decline sharply. Production and employ-
ment estimates have been revised down, and many firms are experiencing tighter financing condi-
tions. 

 

10  CANADIAN ECONOMY

uncertainty have led to a sharp fall in consumer and business confidence 
and decreased private demand (Chart 8).4   

 

 

                                                 

4  For example, consumer-oriented firms consulted in March 2020 by the Bank’s regional offices re-

ported a collapse in sales. For details, see the spring Business Outlook Survey.

Household wealth has decreased due, in part, to the steep decline in stock 
markets. This is likely to prompt consumers to increase their precautionary 
savings and restrain their spending. The Canadian financial system remains 
resilient, although volatile markets and increased financial stress have put 
pressure on financial institutions and markets as households and busi-
nesses seek to draw on their lines of credit (Chart 9). Financial institutions 
have introduced programs to help address the challenges related to 
COVID-19 that their customers are facing. These programs include com-
mitments to provide increased flexibility and payment deferrals on mort-
gages, credit cards and lines of credit. Moreover, the Bank of Canada’s nu-
merous and timely actions to increase liquidity are aimed at helping to 
keep lending channels open (Table 1). 

 

Even with all the policy actions that have been put in place, the effects of 
COVID-19 on both total supply and total demand in the near term are sig-
nificant and negative—and are amplified by the oil price shock. The Bank 
has used scenario analysis to estimate the level of real GDP to be about 1 
to 3 and 15 to 30 percent lower in the first and second quarters of 2020, 
respectively, than in the fourth quarter of 2019. Despite a high level of un-
certainty, these estimates suggest that the near-term downturn will be the 
sharpest on record. 

The direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 will weigh heavily on con-
sumer price index (CPI) inflation in the coming months, which is expected 
to slump to close to 0 percent in the second quarter of 2020. Canadians 
will see increases in prices of some items in the near term, given upward 
pressure from supply-side constraints and pass-through of the 

12  CANADIAN ECONOMY 

BANK OF CANADA | MONETARY POLICY REPORT | APRIL 2020 

depreciation of the Canadian dollar. However, the decline in gasoline 
prices and the effects of lower demand can be expected to dominate in 
the overall measure of inflation.     

Extreme economic and financial stress has been 
met with an exceptional policy response 
The severity of the current shocks has demanded a bold policy response. A 
complementary set of fiscal, monetary and financial policy measures has been 
put in place to help offset lost income, boost access to credit and lower debt-
service costs (Table 1).5  In addition to spending for the health-care sector to 
combat COVID-19, federal and provincial governments have announced di-
rect support for households and businesses. This includes the Canada Emer-
gency Response Benefit and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.6  Both 
levels of government have also introduced payment and tax deferrals that will 
leave more than $120 billion in the hands of households and businesses 
through this challenging period. All told, these measures are expected to re-
place much of the lost income for workers in the most-affected sectors and 
will significantly ease cash-flow pressures.   

One important feature of the fiscal policies is that they are elastic: they are 
designed to adjust depending on the size of the impacts on employment 
and economic activity. This additional flexibility should give households 
greater confidence that they will continue to have the support they need 
to meet their day-to-day costs of living. As a result of the wage subsidy 
program, some businesses may be able to stay open, although with re-
duced operations. In addition, those workers benefiting from the wage 
subsidy program will maintain relationships with their employers, which 
offers some comfort that they will be better able to resume work later 
even if they are not working their normal hours now. 

In addition, the federal government is supporting small and medium-sized 
enterprises through lending programs by Export Development Canada, the 
Business Development Bank of Canada and financial institutions. As well, 
initial measures taken by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial In-
stitutions have freed up additional bank lending capacity by lowering the 
Domestic Stability Buffer by 1.25 percentage points to 1 percent of risk-

5  The near-term objectives of economic policy are different in the context of COVID-19 than for a typ-

ical economic downturn. Because much of the current reduction in activity is due to the necessary 
efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19, fiscal policy has focused on helping bridge the temporary 
loss of income that many households and businesses are facing. Other policies, including those by 
the Bank of Canada, are also aimed at helping ensure these households and businesses have access 
to low-cost credit. 

6  The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy provides a wage subsidy of up to 75 percent for up to 

12 weeks to encourage employers to rehire affected workers and prevent further job losses. For 
workers who have lost their income due to COVID-19, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit 
provides a taxable benefit of $2,000 per month for up to four months. 

13  CANADIAN ECONOMY

weighted assets. Lastly, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is 
providing an additional funding option for mortgages through the Insured 
Mortgage Purchase Program. 

The Bank’s actions have been aimed at preventing a disruption in credit 
flows to support the ability of households and businesses to access the 
credit they need to get through the downturn. The Bank has introduced 
multiple programs and facilities that support the functioning of key mar-
kets and provide liquidity to financial institutions. It has also cut its key 
policy interest rate by 150 basis points.7  These actions to support the 
economy and financial system complement the measures taken by fiscal 
authorities to avoid a far worse economic outcome during the contain-
ment period and promote the subsequent recovery.

As restrictions are lifted, the economy will recover 
Canada’s economy will begin to recover as the health impacts of COVID-

19 fade, businesses begin to reopen and gradually resume their opera-

tions, and people start returning to their normal lives.   

The recovery will be supported through several channels. As measures to 
control the spread of COVID-19 are eased, non-essential businesses will 
reopen and will recall workers at a brisk pace.8  The government’s wage 
subsidy will have supported this process by keeping some workers at-
tached to their employers, making job matching less costly and time-con-
suming than otherwise. More generally, fiscal policies should help prevent 
a long-lasting decline in business and consumer confidence. Nevertheless, 
while there may be a rebound in growth, output is likely to remain below 
pre-pandemic levels for some time. 

Business confidence is expected to strengthen as demand picks up and 
many firms reactivate their investment and hiring plans. In turn, rising em-
ployment and improving consumer confidence will propel consumer 
spending, particularly given pent-up demand from the efforts to control 
COVID-19. The housing market will benefit from a rebound in household 
income and low borrowing costs. 

8  Measured growth will temporarily increase sharply because economic activity was very low during 

the containment period. Such rapid increases are mechanical and say little about the underlying 
rate of growth. 

15  CANADIAN ECONOMY 

BANK OF CANADA | MONETARY POLICY REPORT | APRIL 2020 

 

The rebound will be supported by the ongoing access to credit provided 
to Canadian firms and households by a resilient Canadian financial sys-
tem—including its banks, financial market infrastructures and non-bank fi-
nancial intermediation. That resilience is periodically assessed through the 
Bank’s top-down stress-testing exercises. While the COVID-19 shock has 
some significant differences from our past scenarios, these stress tests in-
dicate that Canada’s large lenders are well positioned to weather a severe 
economic and financial downturn.9  In addition, in the current context, fi-
nancial institutions’ continued ability to provide credit is being strongly 
supported by robust policy measures that address market functioning and 
funding liquidity issues. 

The economy may also see some positive innovations in the way services 
are delivered and work is organized, accelerating ongoing structural 
changes. For example, online sales and the digital economy could benefit 
from a sustained boost as consumers adopt new services that minimize 
disruptions to their daily lives. Increased teleworking could reduce some of 
the geographic barriers workers face, making the labour market more dy-
namic and flexible. 

Finally, although oil prices are expected to remain low, a recovery in global 
economic activity should cause a gradual improvement in prices. This 
would benefit activity in the oil and gas sector. As well, a rebound in for-
eign demand and the weaker Canadian dollar will support non-commodity 
exports. However, due to the different timing of the recovery across coun-
tries, this rebound could be uneven. 

The outlook for Canadian economic activity is highly 
uncertain 
Considerable uncertainty surrounds the timing and evolution of the recov-
ery. Its speed will depend heavily on how the pandemic and the efforts to 
control it unfold as well as on developments in global oil markets. In addi-
tion, several forces will influence the dynamic of economic activity after 
the downturn. Policy stimulus will support the recovery. However, the un-
certainty and scarring effects of the recession on confidence and produc-
tion capacity could prolong the recovery substantially (Figure 1).

range of possible outcomes, rather than one base-case projection. In this 
Report, we illustrate possible outcomes based on different, yet plausible, 
assumptions about the length of the downturn and speed of the recovery. 

First, we consider a scenario where the containment measures are relaxed 
soon and policy measures successfully limit any potential structural dam-
age to the economy, in both Canada and our major trading partners. In 
such a scenario, foreign demand would come back relatively quickly, and 
global supply chains would be up and running in short order. Consumer 
and business confidence would also recover, providing an additional boost 
to growth. Moreover, many of the most affected industries tend to have 
higher job turnover, reflecting that they typically employ younger and 
more mobile workers (Chart 10). This could help limit skill mismatches and 
search costs during the recovery.

Overall, in this less severe and less persistent scenario, the decline in eco-
nomic activity is abrupt and deep but relatively short-lived. The recession 
would be rapidly followed by a strong rebound in activity, particularly if 
the price of oil also bounced back quickly, in line with foreign demand. 

While many economic activities are expected to recover, adverse effects in 
some sectors of the economy could be more severe and persistent than in 
the first scenario. This would be the case if the impact of the pandemic 
and low oil prices were to cause long-lasting damage to the productive 
capacity of the Canadian economy, with scarring effects from persistent 
unemployment and firm destruction.   

In the second scenario, we therefore consider that the impact on house-
holds and businesses could be more severe and much more persistent. For 
example, if control measures are required for a longer period, the impact 
of the pandemic would be greater. This could, in turn, lead a significant 
number of businesses to permanently close their doors during the down-
turn, resulting in some permanent costs through the bankruptcy process. 
The productive value of the plant and equipment of these firms as well as 
that of the firm-specific human and knowledge capital could be largely 
gone. For example, Canada lost many exporters in the aftermath of the 
2008–09 recession, which weighed on exports well into the recovery. 
Moreover, workers who are let go may need to move to different indus-
tries or relocate, implying potentially longer spells of unemployment and 
an erosion of their skills and knowledge. Together, these effects could 
cause structural damage to the economy that might not be undone for 
several years, if ever.

BANK OF CANADA | MONETARY POLICY REPORT | APRIL 2020 

The recovery of foreign demand could be much slower if the global impact 
of the pandemic is larger and prolonged, which would further weigh on oil 
prices. Should prices remain weak for an extended period, businesses 
would face heightened liquidity issues, some businesses would likely shut 
down, and the contraction in activity could be substantial. 

A more prolonged downturn would also mean that households, busi-
nesses and governments could be more indebted by the time the recovery 
takes hold. A rebound in net wealth as well as a recovery in consumer con-
fidence and spending could take time. It is also possible that credit mar-
kets may be impaired and slow to recover, despite central bank support. 

Under this second scenario, future growth would be severely dampened, 
with economic activity remaining below its pre-pandemic level for an ex-
tended period. 

Many paths for the economic recovery are possible. Chart 11 shows a 
range of plausible paths based on the two scenarios described above, 
illustrating the high degree of uncertainty that households, businesses and 
policy-makers currently face. 

The weak economic outlook will weigh on inflation 
Because of the severe and adverse effects of the pandemic, there is con-
siderable uncertainty around the outlook for inflation. Determining the im-
pact of the economic contraction on future inflation is difficult because 
both supply and demand are falling. There will also likely be technical 
challenges to measuring inflation during the containment period.   

19  CANADIAN ECONOMY 

BANK OF CANADA | MONETARY POLICY REPORT | APRIL 2020 

 

CPI inflation is measured using fixed weights, so it will not capture changes 
to consumer spending patterns. For example, consumers are likely to buy 
less gasoline and book fewer flights, making price declines in these catego-
ries less relevant to them. However, consumers also are likely to spend more 
on medical products and food in stores. Given the increased demand for 
these products, they could see larger price increases. Core inflation 
measures will be helpful to look through some of this volatility.   

Overall, the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 will weigh heavily on 
near-term CPI inflation. Inflation is expected to be close to 0 percent in the 
second quarter of 2020, primarily reflecting the sharp drop in gasoline 
prices and, to a lesser extent, travel services such as hotels and travel 
tours. The impact on inflation will be partially mitigated by the lower Ca-
nadian dollar, which can be expected to result in higher import prices. Un-
der the first, more favourable scenario, inflation would increase gradually 
as the effects of past oil price declines dissipate, the economy strengthens 
and excess supply is absorbed. The gradual return to target would be facil-
itated by well-anchored inflation expectations. How quickly inflation re-
turns to target will depend on the timing and strength of the recovery.   

The various paths for the recovery illustrated in Chart 11 imply a range of 
inflation projections (Chart 12). This range understates the uncertainty in 
the outlook for inflation because there are both upside and downside risks 
to each of these projections. Moreover, uncertainty is greater than usual.10 

                                                 

10  For reference, a statistical analysis of the Bank’s forecast errors in the January 2020 Report sug-

gests that a 50 percent confidence interval around the base-case projection widens from ±0.2 per-
centage points in the current quarter to ±0.6 percentage points by the end of the projection hori-
zon. Over the same period, a 90 percent confidence band widens from ±0.6 to ±1.4 percentage 
points. Currently, uncertainty would be considerably greater than these calculations suggest. 

20  CANADIAN ECONOMY

BANK OF CANADA | MONETARY POLICY REPORT | APRIL 2020 

On the downside, there is the risk that supply recovers more quickly than 
demand. This would be the case if businesses reopen quickly but consum-
ers remain cautious for longer, perhaps because of uncertainty over 
COVID-19 or economic concerns. A shift in consumer preferences could 
also weigh on some sectors, like travel and restaurants, that have been se-
verely affected by the pandemic. A slower, more protracted recovery, as in 
the second scenario, could also lead to prolonged weakness in inflation 
through persistent excess supply. 

While the downside risks to inflation are likely larger, there are upside 
risks. If demand were to rebound faster than supply after the control 
measures are lifted, there would be a boost to inflation due to the release 
of pent-up demand and the effects of substantial fiscal and monetary 
stimulus. Disruptions to supply chains and the labour market could also 
put upward pressure on prices for specific goods and services, for exam-
ple, if fewer temporary foreign workers led to less agricultural production. 

The current economic environment has 
extraordinary implications for monetary policy 
The combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price collapse poses 
unique challenges for the conduct of monetary policy and achieving the 
Bank’s 2 percent inflation target. The pandemic and the resulting control 
measures are having profound effects on both demand and supply as well 
as causing extraordinary financial market stress. This stress is disrupting 
the flow of credit and impairing the transmission of monetary policy. 

The Bank lowered the target for the overnight rate in recent weeks by 
150 basis points to the effective lower bound of 25 basis points.11  This re-
duction reinforced other actions taken to help ensure affordable credit is 
available to households and firms. This access is critical during the con-
tainment period to facilitate the borrowing needed to bridge temporary 
shortfalls in income. Lower interest rates will help lower the cost of bor-
rowing, thereby supporting demand. These actions complement the sub-
stantial fiscal stimulus recently put in place by the federal and provincial 
governments to sustain jobs, income and businesses in Canada. 

The Bank has taken other measures to maintain access to credit by sup-
porting the functioning of key financial markets, including those for gov-
ernment debt, and by providing more access to liquidity to financial

institutions (Table 1). As a result, the Bank’s settlement balances have pas-
sively increased as the Bank’s asset purchases grew.12   

As the pandemic recedes and measures constraining the supply of goods 
and services are relaxed, the prevailing low interest rates and other 
measures to maintain access to credit will boost demand and strengthen 
the recovery.   

The Bank will closely monitor the effectiveness of its actions, as well as the 
fiscal and other policy actions taken, and will assess whether output and 
inflation are on self-sustaining paths toward the full employment level and 
the 2 percent inflation target, respectively.   

                                                 

12  Given the existence of excess settlement balances, a floor, rather than a corridor, system is being 
used to implement monetary policy at the effective lower bound. Under a floor system, the target 
for the overnight rate is equal to the deposit rate, which is normally set 25 basis points below the 
target rate under the corridor system. For further information, consult Framework for Market Opera-
tions and Liquidity Provision.

Canada’s Inflation-Control Strategy1
Inflation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to pro-
mote the economic and financial well-being of Canadians.

  Canada’s experience with inflation targeting since 

1991 has shown that the best way to foster confidence 
in the value of money and to contribute to sustained 
economic growth, employment gains and improved 
living standards is by keeping inflation low, stable and 
predictable.

  In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada 

renewed Canada’s inflation-control target for a further 
five-year period, ending December 31, 2021. The target, 
as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), remains 
at the 2 per cent midpoint of the control range of 1 to 
3 per cent.

The monetary policy instrument
  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes 

in the target for the overnight rate of interest.2 These 
changes are transmitted to the economy through their 
influence on market interest rates, domestic asset prices 
and the exchange rate, which affect total demand for 
Canadian goods and services. The balance between 
this demand and the economy’s production capacity is, 
over time, the primary determinant of inflation pressures 
in the economy.

  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to 
eight quarters—to work their way through the economy 
and have their full effect on inflation. For this reason, 
monetary policy must be forward-looking.

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent 

communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspec-
tive on the forces at work on the economy and their 
implications for inflation. The Monetary Policy Report 
is a key element of this approach. Policy decisions are 
typically announced on eight pre-set days during the 

year, and full updates of the Bank’s outlook, including 
risks to the projection, are published four times per year 
in the Monetary Policy Report.

Inflation targeting is symmetric and flexible
  Canada’s inflation-targeting approach is symmetric, 

which means that the Bank is equally concerned about 
inflation rising above or falling below the 2 per cent target.

  Canada’s inflation-targeting framework is flexible. 

Typically, the Bank seeks to return inflation to target over 
a horizon of six to eight quarters. However, the most 
appropriate horizon for returning inflation to target will 
vary depending on the nature and persistence of the 
shocks buffeting the economy.

Monitoring inflation
  In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components 
can be particularly volatile. These components, as well 
as changes in indirect taxes such as GST, can cause 
sizable fluctuations in CPI.

  In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look 

through such transitory movements in CPI inflation and 
focuses on a set of “core” inflation measures that better 
reflect the underlying trend of inflation. In this sense, 
these measures act as an operational guide to help the 
Bank achieve the CPI inflation target. They are not a 
replacement for CPI inflation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core inflation 
are CPI-trim, which excludes CPI components whose 
rates of change in a given month are the most extreme; 
CPI-median, which corresponds to the price change 
located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket weight) 
of the distribution of price changes; and CPI-common, 
which uses a statistical procedure to track common 
price changes across categories in the CPI basket.

1  See Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target (October 24, 2016) and Renewal of the 

Inflation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide additional  monetary 

stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website, describes 
these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Global Economy

Global economic growth continues to strengthen and broaden across coun-
tries and regions (Chart 1). The US economy is expanding at a moderate 
pace, and there are signs of a more consistent pickup in activity across 
the euro area. Growth has resumed in some emerging-market economies 
(EMEs) that had been in recession. Both global trade and investment growth 
have firmed, reflecting the more synchronous expansion worldwide and the 
bottoming-out of the effects of the oil price shock. Global economic growth 
is expected to reach around 3 1/2 per cent in 2017 (Table 1). Core inflation 
has eased recently in some advanced economies, owing in large part to 
temporary factors, while existing slack is being absorbed.

A number of unknowns, particularly with respect to US trade policy, still 
cloud the outlook. While the global projection continues to incorporate 
the judgment that such uncertainty will have a negative impact on trade 
and investment decisions, these unknowns remain a downside risk to the 
projection.

Global financial conditions continue to support growth
Yields on long-term sovereign bonds have edged up since April, but they 
remain low by historical standards. The increase in yields has been driven 
by stronger growth and market expectations of less accommodative mon-
etary policy in advanced economies, including the reduction of the Federal 
Reserve balance sheet that is anticipated to begin later this year. Global 
credit spreads remain near their post-crisis lows, and equity prices are close 
to past highs. The US dollar has seen a modest depreciation.

The US economy is expected to grow at a moderate pace
Economic developments in the United States have evolved largely as 
expected at the time of the April Monetary Policy Report. First-quarter 
growth slowed primarily because of transitory factors, including drag from 
inventories and a weather-related decline in the consumption of utilities. 
Meanwhile, growth was supported by an unexpectedly strong and broad 
increase in business investment, including a sharp rebound in energy invest-
ment. Recent data, including labour income and consumption, are in line 
with an expected rebound in growth in the second quarter. Inflation has 
been weaker than expected, owing in large part to temporary factors. The 
pace of job gains remains consistent with a falling unemployment rate.

The prospects of expansionary US fiscal policy are less clear than 
they appeared in April, given delays in decision-making processes. 
Consequently, the fiscal stimulus assumed in the January and April fore-
casts has been removed.1

US economic fundamentals remain supportive of anticipated growth of 
around 2 per cent over the projection horizon, slightly above estimated 
potential growth of 1 3/4 per cent. Consumption growth should remain firm, 
sustained by gains in labour income. Solid domestic demand is anticipated 
to continue to support business investment (Chart 2). Net exports, in con-
trast, are likely to remain a source of drag, driven partly by the past appre-
ciation of the US dollar.

In the April projection the assumed stimulus added 1/2 per cent to the projected level of US GDP by 
mid-2019.

Euro area growth prospects are still improving
Recent developments point to more momentum in the euro area than antici-
pated in April, and growth has become more widespread across member 
countries. In the first quarter, every member experienced positive growth, 
which was the second time this happened in the past year (Chart 1).

Recent indicators, including the Purchasing Managers’ Index and measures 
of consumer confidence, suggest above-potential growth. Policy uncer-
tainty also appears to have declined in recent months, partly reflecting the 
outcome of the election in France. Highly accommodative monetary policy 
and improved credit growth should continue to support a pace of expan-
sion of around 1 3/4 per cent over the 2017–18 period, before tapering off to 
1 1/2 per cent in 2019, as the output gap closes.

In Japan sluggish wage gains and slow potential growth suggest a pace of 
expansion of around 1 per cent over the projection horizon.

Core inflation remains subdued in advanced economies
Core inflation has been soft in a number of advanced economies (Chart 3). 
In many cases, this reflects remaining excess capacity—especially persis-
tent labour market slack, which has held back wage growth. Wage and price 
inflation in these economies should pick up over the projection horizon as 
above-potential growth continues.

However, the fact that core inflation is soft and has also drifted down 
recently in some advanced economies, despite diminishing economic slack, 
requires further analysis. In large part, this softening can be attributed to 
temporary factors. In the United States, for example, increased competi-
tion among telecommunications providers and the introduction of certain 
generic pharmaceuticals have resulted in what are likely one-time declines 
in price levels.

The slowdown in inflation in several regions, however, suggests that common 
factors may also be playing a role. One possible explanation is that infla-
tion expectations may have drifted downward resulting from a long period 
of below-target inflation in many advanced economies. Structural changes 
related to technological advances in the global economy may also be playing 
a role. Such advances may have boosted productivity in ways that are not 
readily measured, adding to global potential growth and thus implying that 
there is more excess capacity than is captured by standard estimates. The 
rise of e-commerce may also have heightened retail competition, by enabling 
retailers to compete across national borders, thus changing pricing behaviour 
and making prices more sensitive to new information and global market 
conditions. If lower inflation reflects increased global potential and heightened 
competition, it suggests higher living standards rather than signalling eco-
nomic weakness. Evidence on various factors influencing inflation is mixed, 
and further analysis will be needed to assess their relative importance.2

Emerging-market economies continue to drive global growth
The outlook for China’s economy remains consistent with the April Report. 
Growth has been uneven over the first half of the year, with a softer-than-
expected first quarter offset by signs of stronger momentum in the second 
quarter. Credit growth remains elevated but should continue to gradually 
taper. Growth in China is expected to slow modestly over the projection 
horizon, from around 6 1/2 per cent in 2017 to 6 1/4 per cent in 2018–19, 
alongside an ongoing rebalancing toward more consumption-based growth.

There is more near-term momentum in oil-importing EMEs than was 
expected at the time of the April Report, reflecting a stronger resumption of 
growth in some countries, such as Brazil. Ongoing recoveries in EMEs that 
had been in recession and progress on economic reforms in some countries 
should support a pickup in growth from about 4 per cent in 2017 to around 
4 1/4 per cent in 2019.

Productivity Slowdown or a Measurement Problem?” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (Spring 
2016) and C. Syverson, “Challenges to Mismeasurement Explanations for the U.S. Productivity 
Slowdown,” NBER Working Paper No. 21974 (February 2016).

The pace of expansion in oil-exporting countries is projected to rise as the 
impact of the past oil price decline eases. Growth in the “rest of the world” 
grouping is expected to increase from about 1 3/4 per cent in 2017 to 
around 2 3/4 per cent in 2019.

Rising US shale oil production is contributing to price declines
Benchmark prices for global crude oil have recently averaged US$50 per 
barrel (Brent), about 10 per cent lower than assumed in April. The 
announced extension of the production cut by the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other oil producers into early 
2018 has not fully relieved market anxiety over stronger-than-anticipated 
growth in US shale oil production and elevated inventories (Chart 4).

There are both upside and downside risks to oil prices. In the near term, 
risks are tilted to the downside because technological advances may 
continue to lower the costs of oil production, particularly the production of 
US shale oil. Supply could also increase quickly in 2018 if there were a dis-
orderly exit from OPEC’s current production agreement. Although techno-
logical advances may continue to exert downward pressures beyond 2018, 
upside risks are expected to dominate, since past investment cuts may lead 
to insufficient capacity to meet growing demand.

With respect to non-energy commodities, agricultural prices are higher 
than in April, partly due to weather-related disruptions in North America 
and Europe. Lumber prices are somewhat weaker as a result of softer US 
housing starts. Markets had largely priced in the additional anti-dumping 
duties on Canadian softwood lumber exports announced by the United 
States in June. Iron ore prices have declined, in part because of ongoing 
excess supply. Other base metal prices are broadly unchanged on aggre-
gate. Looking ahead, the Bank of Canada’s non-energy commodity price 
index should remain stable over the projection horizon.

Canadian Economy

Economic activity has grown strongly in recent quarters. While demand 
growth is led by robust household spending, early signs that its sources are 
becoming more balanced include recent pickups in exports and business 
investment. Growth is also broadening across regions and sectors, with 
more than two-thirds of industries expanding (Chart 5).

Over the projection horizon, the Bank expects the economy to continue to 
absorb excess capacity by expanding faster than potential output, albeit at 
a slower pace than in recent quarters. Economic activity will be supported 
by rising foreign demand, fiscal stimulus and accommodative monetary and 
financial conditions. Increased exports and investment will contribute to the 
anticipated broadening in the composition of demand, helping to sustain 
economic expansion as growth in both residential investment and house-
hold consumption slows.

Largely reflecting the surge in growth at the start of the year, real GDP 
is anticipated to expand by 2.8 per cent in 2017 before moderating to 
2.0 per cent in 2018 and 1.6 per cent in 2019 (Table 2 and Box 1). The 
output gap is expected to close around the end of 2017, earlier than pro-
jected in April.

Consumer price index (CPI) inflation has been soft recently, for the most 
part as a result of food, electricity and automobile prices. Excess supply 
in the economy has also been a factor. Inflation is forecast to pick up and 
return close to 2 per cent in the middle of 2018 as relative price movements 
dissipate and excess capacity is absorbed.

Box 1

Key Inputs to the Base-Case Projection
The Bank’s projection is always conditional on several key 
assumptions, and changes to them will aﬀ ect the outlook 
for the global and Canadian economies . The Bank regularly 
reviews these assumptions and assesses the sensitivity of 
the economic projection to them .
•  Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent average 

levels . The per-barrel prices in US dollars for Brent, 
West Texas Intermediate and Western Canada Select 
are about $50, $45 and $35, respectively, weaker than 
assumed in the April Report .

•  By convention, the Bank does not attempt to forecast 

the exchange rate in the base-case projection . Therefore, 
over the projection horizon, the Canadian dollar is 
assumed to remain close to its recent average of 76 cents . 
This assumption is broadly in line with the April Report .
•  The output gap is assumed to show excess capacity of 

1/2 per cent in the second quarter of 2017, based on the 

midpoint of the Bank’s estimate that excess capacity in 
the Canadian economy was in a range of 0 to 1 per cent .1 
This assumption compares with the April assumption of 
3/4 per cent excess capacity for the fi rst quarter of 2017 .

•  Annual potential output growth is assumed to average 
1 .4 per cent over the 2017–19 projection horizon, close 
to the midpoint of the Bank’s estimated range (Table 2) . 
This assumption is unchanged from April . Further details 
on the Bank’s assessment of potential output are pro-
vided in the Appendix to the April 2017 Report . 

•  The neutral nominal policy rate in Canada is estimated 

to be between 2 .5 and 3 .5 per cent . The current pro-
jection is based on the midpoint of this range, which is 
unchanged from the April assumption . 

1  The level of potential output in the fi rst quarter of 2017 is unchanged relative to 

the April Report .

Near-term growth is expected to remain solidly above potential
Growth in GDP in the first quarter of 2017 picked up strongly to 3.7 per cent, 
in line with expectations in the April Report (Table 3, Chart 6). Domestic 
demand was robust: consumption growth strengthened, housing activity 
rose sharply, and investment in the oil and gas sector rebounded from a 
prolonged steep decline. A large rebuilding of manufacturing inventories, 
following a drawdown in the previous quarter, also added significantly to 
growth. In contrast, outside the resource sector, the expansion of exports 
and investment spending remained subdued.

GDP growth is projected to average 2 1/2 per cent in the second and third 
quarters and remain above potential output growth. Recent monthly data 
indicate that export growth has increased while business investment growth 
has eased. In particular, relative to the first quarter, oil and gas drilling rig 
activity has levelled off, and the strong growth in imports of machinery 
and equipment has slowed. In addition, activity in the housing sector has

BANK OF CANADA  •  MonEtaRy PolICy REPoRt  •  July 2017

abated, largely as a result of sharp declines in resales in Toronto and sur-
rounding areas. At the same time, growth in consumer spending is projected 
to slow to a more sustainable pace as the temporary effect of government 
transfers and special payments on growth in household disposable income 
diminishes.3 As well, motor vehicle sales, which have been stronger than 
suggested by fundamental drivers of demand, are at an all-time high and are 
expected to moderate.

Excess capacity in the economy continues to be absorbed
Over the past year, a significant amount of excess capacity in the economy 
has been absorbed, as indicated by a narrowing in the Bank’s two measures 
of economic slack.4 Responses to the Bank’s summer Business Outlook 
Survey also suggest an increase in capacity pressures. Overall, the Bank 
judges that in the second quarter of 2017 the degree of excess capacity in 
the economy was between 0 and 1 per cent. This compares with a range of 
estimated excess capacity between 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 per cent a year earlier.5

Several labour market indicators are consistent with this assessment, sug-
gesting that labour market slack is also being absorbed, although with a lag. 
In recent months, employment growth has been solid and the unemploy-
ment rate has declined. The Business Outlook Survey also points to a 
broad-based tightening in labour market conditions, with increasing reports 
of the prevalence and intensity of labour shortages. Various wage measures 
continue to suggest modest growth, although wage growth as measured 
by the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours has risen to 2.3 per cent 
on average since the beginning of the year, up from 1.2 per cent on average 
over 2016.6, 7 Other indicators suggest slack remains, particularly in energy-
intensive sectors and regions. Slack is also reflected in elevated levels of 
long-term unemployment and below-trend average hours worked.

Temporary factors have dampened inflation in recent months
CPI inflation has fallen since the beginning of the year, reaching an estimated 
1.4 per cent on average in the second quarter, while two of the Bank’s three 
measures of core inflation have also continued to decline (Chart 7).8 The slow-
down in inflation can be explained mainly by easing consumer energy and 
automobile price inflation (Box 2). Both slower gasoline price inflation and the 
electricity rebates from the Ontario government have weighed on consumer 
energy prices. CPI inflation and the core measures are also being held down 
by current and past economic slack, but this effect has declined in recent 
quarters. In addition, it is possible that global structural factors, as discussed 
on page 4, could be contributing to low inflation in Canada.

3  While the Canada Child Benefit provided a temporary boost to consumption growth, it will continue to 

support the level of household spending going forward.

4  The Bank’s structural and statistical estimates of the output gap can be found at Statistics > 
Indicators > Indicators of Capacity and Inflation Pressures for Canada on the Bank’s website.

5  This represents our latest estimate, including historical revisions and excluding the impact of the wildfires 
in Alberta in that quarter. In the July 2016 Report, the Bank estimated that excess capacity, excluding the 
impact of the wildfires, was between 1 and 2 per cent. 

6  This increase in wage growth is observed in the variable weight measure from the Survey of 

Employment, Payrolls and Hours.

7  Bank staff estimate that the decline in commodity prices may have reduced wage growth by about 

0.5 percentage points by mid-2016. For a related discussion, see D. Brouillette, J. Ketcheson, O. 
Kostyshyna and J. Lachaine, “Wage Growth in Canada and the United States: Factors Behind Recent 
Weakness,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2017-8 (July 2017) and Box 4 of the April 2017 
Monetary Policy Report.

8  CPI inflation eased more than anticipated in recent months, primarily because of a slowing in the 

growth of automobile prices that was more pronounced than expected.

Accounting for the Recent Infl ation Slowdown in Canada 
Canadian consumer price index (CPI) infl ation has eased 
since the beginning of the year . The slowdown in year-over-
year infl ation is primarily refl ected in goods price infl ation, 
while services price infl ation has remained relatively steady . 
In particu lar, consumer energy price infl ation and auto price 
infl ation have declined . Together, these factors reduced 
infl ation by 0 .7 percentage points between the fi rst and 
second quarter of 2017 .

Consumer energy price infl ation has abated 
As expected, the strong rise in consumer energy prices 
in January 2017 has started to dissipate and has led to 
a slowdown in CPI infl ation of about 0 .5 percentage 
points between the fi rst and second quarter of this year 
(Chart 2-A) . This includes, in part, the recent decline in 
crude oil prices as well as the waning eﬀ ect of the strong 

Chart 2-A: 
CPI components, year-over-year percentage change, monthly data

Consumer energy price infl ation has abated

price increases in 2016 . In addition, Ontario government 
measures have reduced the cost of electricity to consumers . 
As of May, national CPI electricity prices were 5 .5 per cent 
lower than a year earlier . 
Auto price infl ation has slowed signifi cantly
The recent sharp decline in auto price infl ation pulled CPI 
infl ation down by about 0 .2 percentage points between the 
fi rst and second quarter of this year (Chart 2-B) . 
Between August 2015 and September 2016, auto prices 
increased substantially in Canada, likely refl ecting strong 
demand and the eﬀ ects of a lower Canadian dollar . Since 
then, auto price infl ation has receded steeply, returning 
close to its historical average in May . This dynamic appears 
specifi c to Canada, since infl ation in new cars in the United 
States has remained relatively stable .

GDP growth is expected to broaden further
The Bank projects that real GDP growth will remain above that of potential 
output and broaden further but will moderate over the projection horizon. 
Real GDP is anticipated to expand by 2.8 per cent in 2017, 2.0 per cent 
in 2018 and 1.6 per cent in 2019 (Table 2). Primarily because household 
expenditures are more robust than expected, growth is stronger in 
2017 and 2018 than projected in April. Consequently, economic slack is 
absorbed more quickly, with the output gap now anticipated to close around 
the end of 2017. Growth in 2019 is projected to approach estimated potential 
output growth.

Growth is expected to continue to broaden across sectors and regions 
because the economy has largely adjusted to the decline in oil prices that 
began in the second half of 2014. In particular, the drag on investment 
spending and economic growth from lower oil prices is mostly over, and 
growth in commodity-related activity is resuming. This economic adjustment 
has been supported by accommodative monetary and financial conditions 
and the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar. However, the adverse 
effect on incomes lingers, particularly in energy-intensive provinces.

At the same time, production in other goods industries is also picking up, 
while the solid expansion in the service sector persists (Chart 8). Results 
from the summer Business Outlook Survey also suggest that growth will 
continue to broaden. For example, forward-looking indicators of business 
activity have generally strengthened across regions and sectors (Chart 9).

Beyond 2017, GDP growth is forecast to broaden further across demand 
categories (Chart 10, Table 2). Export growth is projected to increase as 
foreign demand strengthens, leading to increased investment and an expan-
sion in productive capacity. Government spending is also expected to boost 
growth over the projection horizon, reflecting previously announced fiscal 
measures.9 In particular, public investment is expected to be a significant 

9  Furthermore, the Bank’s base-case economic scenario incorporates the fiscal measures announced since 
the April Report, including the increase in expenditures contained in the Ontario budget. These additional 
measures are estimated to provide further support to economic activity in the 2017–18 fiscal year.

contributor to economic growth over the near term.10 Meanwhile, household 
spending will continue to support growth, but its contribution is anticipated 
to moderate. Consumption growth will be restrained by elevated levels of 
household debt and higher longer-term borrowing costs as global long-term 
yields are projected to gradually rise.

Exports are anticipated to expand with foreign demand…
While Canada’s exports have experienced a structural loss of global market 
share, they have continued to recover and are expected to keep expanding 
over the projection horizon, roughly in line with the broad-based growth in 
foreign demand (Chart 11).11 In particular, overall export growth is expected 
to pick up in the coming quarters—an assessment that is consistent with the 
summer Business Outlook Survey. Many respondents noted that their posi-
tive US outlook was a good sign for sales, citing as examples solid activity 
in the US construction sector, increased demand for information technology 
services and oil, and increased tourism to Canada. However, as anticipated 
in April, changes in the production mandates of multinational auto assem-
blers mean there will be reductions in motor vehicle production later in 2017; 
as a result, exports of motor vehicles and parts will decline.

Growth in commodity exports is anticipated to increase moderately over 
the projection. Prices for oil and base metals have declined recently, limiting 
production growth in these sectors. At the same time, new trade restrictions 
are heavily constraining softwood lumber exports. Conditions are more 
favourable for some other non-energy commodities; for example, growth in 
agricultural production and exports is expected to rise over the projection.

Imports are also expected to grow modestly, supported by growth in 
domestic demand—particularly consumption and investment. The effect 
of the past depreciation of the dollar is evident in some sectors such as 

10  The 2017 federal budget confirmed that the total spending for infrastructure investment introduced in 
the 2016 federal budget and the Fall Economic Statement remains unchanged, although more of the 
spending allocation will occur in the 2018–19 fiscal year.

11  The profile for foreign demand has been revised down relative to the April Report since the projection 

no longer assumes a fiscal stimulus in the United States; see the Global Economy section of this report. 
This change in projection assumptions has an adverse effect on exports and subtracts 0.1 per cent 
from the level of Canadian GDP by the end of 2019.

tourism, since many Canadians are opting to vacation in Canada rather than 
abroad. However, there is limited evidence so far in other sectors that the 
effect of the dollar has led to domestic production replacing imports.

…while business investment is expected to contribute to 
growth
As with exports, business investment is anticipated to increase over the 
projection horizon, triggered by expanding economic activity in both the non-
resource and resource sectors. The expansion in the resource sector indicates 
that the adjustment in the level of investment in this sector in 2015 and 2016 to 
the past oil price shock is largely complete (Chart 2 on page 3).

Growth in investment outside the resource sector is expected to increase 
moderately in the near term as more firms expand their capacity to meet 
future demand.12 Nevertheless, the recovery in business investment is antici-
pated to remain below what would normally be expected based on historical 
experience, partly reflecting structural challenges such as slower labour 
force growth as well as concerns related to US policy uncertainty.13

Investment in the oil and gas sector rebounded sharply in the first quarter 
but is expected to expand gradually over the projection. The outlook is sup-
ported by an analysis of the capital expenditure plans of oil and gas firms 
and the Bank’s consultations with the energy sector. Firms expressed a 
sense of cautious optimism and are prudently implementing their investment 
plans. Investment prospects for the sector are, however, highly contingent 
on the outlook for global oil prices, which have recently declined.14

12  Rates of capacity utilization for many industries in the manufacturing sector are close to or at their 

historical highs. Examples of industries with high capacity utilization rates include chemical products, 
plastics, textiles, leather and allied products, wood products, furniture, and food and beverages.

13  For further discussion, see R. Barnett and R. R. Mendes, “A Structural Interpretation of the Recent 

Weakness in Business Investment,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2017-7 (July 2017).

14  Relative to April, oil prices have been revised down by about US$5. This leads to a downward revision 
to the level of oil and gas investment of about 5 per cent and to the level of GDP of about 0.1 per cent 
by the end of 2019.

Last observation: 2017Q2 

The summer Business Outlook Survey provides evidence that business 
sentiment continues to improve, which bodes well for investment. Intentions 
to increase spending on machinery and equipment over the next year 
remain broad-based across regions and sectors (Chart 12).

Consumer spending remains a significant contributor to 
growth…
Household expenditures are forecast to remain robust in the near term, 
supported by the expansion of employment, an increase in wage growth 
and strong credit growth. There are signs that a rebound in incomes is 
under way in energy-intensive provinces, while incomes outside these prov-
inces continue to register solid gains. Moreover, the strength in consumer 
spending seen through much of the country is spreading to energy-intensive 
provinces—a trend that is expected to continue (Table 4).

Overall, growth in consumption is expected to ease as growth in dispos-
able income gradually slows, partly as the effect of the introduction of the 
Canada Child Benefit fades. High household indebtedness and a slowdown 
in the housing market are also anticipated to weigh on consumer spending.

… while housing activity is likely to ease
Until very recently, housing market activity had been quite strong in some 
regions.15 Of note was the sharp rise in resales and starts through the early 
spring in Toronto and surrounding areas. In addition, markets appeared to 
have bottomed out in Alberta, with sales up from their levels a year ago. 
National house price growth reached 20 per cent on a year-over-year basis 
in April, led by strong price gains in Toronto and surrounding areas and, to a 
lesser extent, in the Greater Vancouver Area.16 Price growth in other parts of 
Canada was much more subdued.

However, a recent sharp decline in resales and moderation in starts in 
Toronto and surrounding areas have contributed to a slowdown in housing 
market activity since April. The Ontario Fair Housing Plan has likely played a 
role, but it is too early to assess the extent of its effect.17

Looking ahead, residential investment is anticipated to contribute less to 
overall growth. Macroprudential and housing policy measures, as well as 
higher longer-term borrowing costs resulting from the projected gradual 
rise in global long-term yields, are all expected to weigh on housing 
expenditures.18

CPI inflation is projected to ease before increasing to 
around 2 per cent
CPI inflation is anticipated to slow somewhat further in the third quarter, to 
average 1.3 per cent, owing in large part to the last installment of Ontario 
electricity rebates in July (Table 3).

Inflation is then projected to rise and reach close to 2 per cent in the middle 
of 2018 (Chart 13).19 Two key relative price movements are expected to 
together add about 0.6 percentage points to inflation. First, food price infla-
tion, which has been weak for some time, is expected to rebound as agricul-
tural prices rise and as the disinflationary effects of increased competition 

15  A more detailed discussion of the housing sector can be found in the June 2017 Bank of Canada 

Financial System Review.

16  This estimate is from the Canadian Real Estate Association MLS Home Price Index and is stronger than 

the 13 per cent national estimate from the Teranet–National Bank House Price Index Composite 11. 
This difference is partly explained by a higher weight assigned by the former to the strong price growth 
in the Greater Toronto Area outside Toronto and Hamilton.

17  In April 2017, the Province of Ontario unveiled its Fair Housing Plan, which introduced a number of 
demand- and supply-side measures. Along with the previous housing policy changes introduced in 
2016, the new measures will promote stability in the housing market and are expected to lead to weaker 
resale activity in the near term.

18  In addition, on July 6, 2017, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions released for public 
consultation draft changes that strengthen and clarify guidelines for mortgage underwriting by federally 
regulated financial institutions. For more information, see the news release.

19  By convention, the Bank assumes a constant exchange rate over the forecast horizon. Consequently, 
there is no effect from changes in the exchange rate on inflation once the effects of past movements 
have dissipated. The effect of commodity prices on inflation is positive but very small over 2019, since 
oil prices are assumed to remain near their recent average levels throughout the projection, while some 
non-energy commodity prices are forecast to increase modestly.

a. This also includes the effect on infl ation of the divergence from the typical relationship between gasoline

b. Fro m 2016Q4 to 2018Q2, on net, other factors mostly represent the expected impact of below-average 

infl ation in food products, which partly refl ects improved crop supplies and intensifi ed competition in the 
retail food sector and the expected impact on electricity prices of Ontario’s Fair Hydro Plan.

in the retail food sector fade (Chart 14).20 Second, the dampening impact 
of the electricity rebates in Ontario on inflation is anticipated to gradually 
dissipate.

In addition, the expected closing of the output gap will have an impact. In 
the third quarter of this year, the effect of excess supply subtracts 0.2 per-
centage points from inflation. As excess supply is absorbed, inflation is 
expected to return sustainably close to the 2 per cent target.

This projection is consistent with medium- and long-term inflation expecta-
tions remaining well anchored. The June 2017 Consensus Economics 
forecast for CPI inflation is 1.9 per cent in 2017 and 2.0 per cent in 2018. 
Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, a reasonable range 
around the base-case projection for CPI inflation is ±0.3 percentage points. 
This range is intended to convey a sense of forecast uncertainty. 

20  Based on global agricultural prices, weakness in food prices has been more pronounced than 

expected, suggesting that increased competition in the domestic retail food sector has also dampened 
price growth. Historically, movements in food price inflation have been broadly in line with lagged 
movements in global agricultural prices. The effect of increased competition in the retail food sector on 
inflation is assumed to dissipate by early 2018.

RISKS to thE InFlatIon outlooK  21 

Risks to the Inflation outlook

The possibility of a notable shift toward protectionist global trade policies 
remains a source of uncertainty surrounding the outlook. However, it is dif-
ficult to fully quantify the implications of this shift without more clarity about 
the actual policy measures and their timing. The Bank applied judgment to 
capture the adverse effects of this uncertainty on business investment and 
exports in the base case. As in April, this helps to better balance the risks 
around the outlook.

The Bank’s outlook for inflation is subject to several upside and downside 
risks originating from both the external environment and the domestic 
economy. Overall, the Bank assesses that the risks to the projected path for 
inflation are roughly balanced. As in past reports, the focus is on a selec-
tion of risks identified as most important for the projected path for inflation, 
drawing from a larger set of risks taken into account in the forecast. 

The evolution of the risks since April is summarized in Table 5. Two of the 
risks in the April Report have been modified. First, sluggish business invest-
ment in Canada has been incorporated into a broader risk that also includes 
weaker export growth. Second, higher potential output in Canada is now part 
of a more comprehensive risk that covers persistent weakness in global and 
Canadian inflation.21 

(i)  Persistent weakness in global and Canadian inflation

Inflation in some advanced economies, including Canada, has slowed. 
While much of the recent slowdown can be accounted for by tem-
porary factors, it is possible that global structural factors, discussed 
on page 4, may be playing a larger role than believed. Over the 
projection horizon, these structural factors could exert disinflationary 
pressure in Canada and abroad that is not fully captured in the base-
case projection. 

Also, as discussed in the April Report, the decline in the measures 
of core inflation in Canada could indicate that the current level of 
potential output is higher than estimated, resulting in more excess 
supply and less inflationary pressure. In addition, as the economy 
approaches full capacity, firm creation and business investment 
could rise by more than expected, and workers who have left the 
labour force or who were underemployed would be fully re-employed, 
boosting potential output over the projection period.22 

21  The risks of higher global long-term interest rates and higher commodity prices mentioned in the April 

Report are not highlighted in this Report but are still being monitored.

22  For background information, see J. Ketcheson, N. Kyui and B. Vincent, “Labour Force Participation: 

A Comparison of the United States and Canada,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note 2017-9 (July 2017).

BANK OF CANADA  •  MonEtaRy PolICy REPoRt  •  July 2017

 

(ii)  Stronger real GDP growth in the United States 

While the base case includes US economic growth that is above the 
rate of potential, an even stronger growth path is also possible. The 
ongoing recovery together with prospective policy changes, such 
as fiscal stimulus and deregulation, could trigger “animal spirits,” or 
a surge in business confidence that leads to an acceleration in the 
rate of investment, firm creation, innovation and productivity growth. 
Stronger US household spending and public and private investment 
would have positive spillovers for Canadian business confidence, 
investment and exports.

(iii)  Weaker exports and sluggish business investment in Canada

While the Bank’s projection for exports and business investment 
is cautious, there is a risk that competitiveness challenges may 
be stronger than anticipated. A further loss in the market share of 
Canadian exporters could postpone prospective investment projects 
or move some investment activities abroad. 

The disappointing performance of business investment since the 
2007–09 global financial crisis could also indicate that demographic 
forces or other structural factors are more relevant than previously 
estimated. 

(iv)  Stronger consumption and rising household debt in Canada

Strong motor vehicle and other retail sales combined with the high 
level of consumer confidence point to robust underlying consumption. 
While the Bank expects growth in consumption to slow in the coming 
quarters, its recent strength could persist if wage and household 
income growth were to increase faster than expected as the labour 
market approaches full employment. Moreover, the recent strength in 
credit growth could persist longer than anticipated. While this would 
provide a boost to economic activity, it could further exacerbate the 
macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities associated with high 
household indebtedness.

(v)  A house price correction in overheated markets in Canada
Imbalances in the Canadian housing market are an important vulner-
ability, particularly in areas where house prices have grown at a faster 
pace than can be readily explained by fundamentals, such as in the 
greater Toronto and Vancouver areas.23 A regional house price correc-
tion would have important adverse effects on residential investment, 
related consumption and real estate services in the affected regions. 
The fall in house prices could further weigh on consumption through 
negative wealth and collateral effects and could be amplified by the 
high levels of household indebtedness. Overall, a regional house price 
correction would most likely be localized but could have a material 
negative impact on the macroeconomic outlook.

Canada’s infl ation-control strategy
Canada’s infl ation-control strategy
Infl ation targeting and the economy
  The objective of Canada’s monetary policy is to promote the 

economic and fi nancial well-being of Canadians. Canada’s 
experience with infl ation targeting since 1991 has shown that the 
best way that monetary policy can achieve this goal is by maintaining 
a low and stable infl ation environment. Doing so fosters confi dence 
in the value of money and contributes to sustained economic growth, 
a strong and inclusive labour market and improved living standards.
In 2021, the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada 
renewed the fl exible infl ation-targeting strategy of the monetary policy 
framework for a further fi ve-year period, ending December 31, 2026.1 
  The infl ation target was renewed at the 2% midpoint of the 1%–3% 

 

control range, with infl ation measured as the 12-month rate of 
change in the consumer price index (CPI). 

  The Government and the Bank agreed that the best contribution 

monetary policy can make to the economic and fi nancial 
well-being of Canadians is to continue to focus on price stability. 
The Government and the Bank also agreed that monetary policy 
should continue to support maximum sustainable employment, 
recognizing that maximum sustainable employment is not directly 
measurable and is determined largely by non-monetary factors 
that can change through time. 

  Further, the Government and the Bank agreed that because well-
anchored infl ation expectations are critical to achieving both price 
stability and maximum sustainable employment, the primary objective 
of monetary policy is to maintain low, stable infl ation over time. 

Infl ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible
  Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means 

the Bank is equally concerned about infl ation rising above or falling 
below the 2% target. 

  Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is also ﬂ exible. Typically, 

the Bank seeks to return infl ation to target over a horizon of six to 
eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning 
infl ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence 
of the shocks buffeting the economy.

  The 2021 agreement with the Government specifi es that the 2% 

infl ation target remains the cornerstone of the framework. 

  The agreement further notes that the Bank will continue to use the 

fl exibility of the 1%–3% control range to actively seek the maximum 
sustainable level of employment, when conditions warrant. The Bank 
will also continue to leverage the fl exibility inherent in the framework 
to help address the challenges of structurally low interest rates by 
using a broad set of policy tools. The Bank will use this fl exibility only 
to an extent that is consistent with keeping medium-term infl ation 
expectations well anchored at 2%.

Monetary policy tools
  Because monetary policy actions take time to work their way through 

the economy and have their full effect on infl ation, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.

  The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes 
in the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate). The 
Bank also has a range of monetary policy tools it can use when the 
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on 
the future evolution of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases 
(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures, 
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these 
tools would depend on the economic and fi nancial market context.

  All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for 

Canadian goods and services through their infl uence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The 
balance between this demand and the economy’s production 
capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl ation 
pressures in the economy.

Communications
  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent communications, 

the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the economy and 
infl ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight pre-set 
days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s outlook are 
published four times each year in the Monetary Policy Report.

  The Bank is committed to explaining when it is using the fl exibility of 

the infl ation-targeting strategy.

  Given the uncertainty about the maximum sustainable level of 

employment, the Bank will consider a broad range of labour market 
indicators.2 The Bank will also systematically report to Canadians on 
how labour market outcomes have factored into its policy decisions.

Monitoring infl ation
 

 

In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile and can cause sizable fl uctuations in CPI infl ation.
In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such 
transitory movements in CPI infl ation and focuses on a set of “core” 
infl ation measures that better refl ect the underlying trend of infl ation. 
In this sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the 
Bank achieve the CPI infl ation target. They are not a replacement for 
CPI infl ation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl ation are CPI-trim, 
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given 
month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which corresponds to 
the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket 
weight) of the distribution of price changes; and CPI-common, which 
uses a statistical procedure to track common price changes across 
categories in the CPI basket.

Clarity and Commitment” (speech to the Empire Club of Canada, Toronto,

Overview 
Overview 

Inflation around the world has continued to rise quickly, largely due to 
increases in the prices for energy and food. Global supply chain challenges 
have also persisted, and when combined with strong demand, this has led to 
a broadening in price pressures. 
Global growth is slowing due to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and 
continued supply chain disruptions. As well, high inflation and monetary 
policy tightening in many countries are beginning to moderate demand.
With the removal of most public health restrictions in Canada, economic 
activity in hard-to-distance service sectors has rebounded strongly. With 
the rest of the economy already more than fully recovered, the Canadian 
economy is now clearly in excess demand. While high inflation in Canada 
is largely the result of international factors, domestic demand pressures are 
becoming more prominent, and price pressures have broadened. 
In response to high inflation and rising inflation expectations, the Bank of 
Canada is raising interest rates. This will temper borrowing and spending, 
slow demand growth, help anchor inflation expectations and ultimately 
reduce inflationary pressures. 

Key messages
  Inflation continues to rise, and price pressures are broadening. Consumer 
price index (CPI) inflation will average close to 8% in the middle quarters of 
2022. Survey responses show that consumer and business expectations 
about inflation over the next two years have moved higher. 

  The Canadian economy is overheated, and labour markets are tight. The 

unemployment rate is at a series low, and elevated job vacancies and 
widespread labour shortages are pushing up wage growth. With strong 
demand for their products, businesses are passing through higher input 
and labour costs to consumer prices.

  With global growth moderating and higher interest rates dampening 

domestic spending, growth in Canada is projected to slow from 3½% in 
2022 to 1¾% in 2023 and 2½% in 2024. This allows supply to catch up 
with demand, reducing domestic inflationary pressures.

  Domestic price pressures are expected to abate, global supply chain 
problems are anticipated to resolve gradually, and energy prices are 
projected to decline. Inflation in Canada is anticipated to decrease to roughly 
3% by the end of 2023 and return to the 2% target by the end of 2024.

  The Bank is guarding against the risk that high inflation becomes 

entrenched because if it does, restoring price stability will require even 
higher interest rates, leading to a weaker economy.

Global economy
Global economy

The global economy is facing multiple headwinds. Inflation is high worldwide 
and continues to increase, largely due to surging energy and food prices. 
Supply challenges are contributing to inflationary pressures as demand is 
recovering from the pandemic. Global economic activity is estimated to have 
declined in the second quarter of 2022 because of the war in Ukraine and 
the lockdown of some major cities in China to limit the spread of COVID-19. 
Growth in US private domestic demand is also estimated to have slowed 
sharply. Many central banks are tightening monetary policy to combat 
increasingly broad-based inflationary pressures. As a result, financial 
conditions have tightened, and this is weighing on global growth. 

Growth should rebound in the third quarter as restrictions ease in China, but 
higher interest rates and the war in Ukraine will continue to restrain activity. 
The Bank projects global growth to moderate to about 3¼% in 2022 and 2% 
in 2023—a slower pace than projected in the April Report mostly because 
of tighter monetary policy (Table 1 and Box 1). Global growth is expected to 
strengthen to 3% in 2024 once the war’s impact on growth subsides.

Changes to the economic projection since the April Report 
Global GDP outlook
Projected growth in global gross domestic product 
(GDP) has been revised down signifi cantly since the 
April Report. It is reduced by about ¼ of a percentage 
point in 2022, ½ a percentage point in 2023 and ¼ of a 
percentage point in 2024. Overall, the level of GDP at 
the end of 2024 is roughly ¾% lower. 

horizon (see Box 2).

The following factors explain the downward revisions to 
the outlook: 

  Given the stronger-than-expected infl ation, monetary 

policy is now expected to be tighter over the 
projection horizon in both advanced and emerging-
market economies. As well, credit conditions 
tightened more than anticipated. 

  Government spending in the United States 
is weaker, partly due to a slower rollout of 
infrastructure spending.

  China’s growth forecast for 2022 is lower because 
COVID-19 containment measures affecting major 
cities have lasted longer than anticipated.

Canadian GDP outlook
GDP growth in 2022 and 2023 has been revised down 
signifi cantly to 3½% and 1¾%, respectively. The forecast 
for growth has been lowered by about ¾ of a percentage 
point in 2022 and by about 1½ percentage points in 
2023. Growth in 2024 has been revised up by ¼ of a 
percentage point to 2½%. These revisions leave the level 
of real GDP about 1¾% lower in 2024.

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONeTARy POLICy RePORT  •  JULy 2022

GLOBAL eCONOMy  3 

The following key factors contribute to the reduced GDP 
profi le:

  Supply has been revised down over the projection 

  Infl ation is higher, fi nancial conditions are tighter, 

and household wealth is lower. As a result, the 
outlook for household expenditures has been 
revised down over the projection horizon.

  The effects of supply chain disruptions on economic 

activity—notably in the manufacturing sector—are 
lasting longer than expected.

  Foreign demand has been revised down in 2023 and 
2024 partly due to tighter global fi nancial conditions, 
leading to lower exports and business investment. 

Canadian CPI infl ation outlook
Consumer price index (CPI) infl ation is anticipated to 
be substantially higher than projected in April. The 
outlook for CPI infl ation has been revised up by almost 
2 percentage points to 7.2% in 2022, by 1.8 percentage 
points to 4.6% in 2023, and by 0.2 percentage points 
to 2.3% in 2024. These revisions mainly refl ect more 
persistent and broad-based infl ationary pressures 
than previously estimated. They also refl ect higher 
commodity prices and wider-than-usual gasoline 
refi nery margins as well as rising infl ation expectations. 
In addition, higher estimates of excess demand in 2022 
raise the infl ation forecast in 2022 and into 2023.

Still-elevated energy prices
Energy prices remain volatile (Chart 1). Since the April Report, Brent crude 
oil prices have fluctuated between about US$100 and US$125 per barrel. Oil 
prices fell in early May due to reduced demand from China in the wake of 
COVID-19 containment measures. Supply concerns, including the European 
Union’s ban on Russian oil imports, subsequently pushed prices up. Over the 
past month, prices have fallen due to concerns about a significant slowdown 
in global growth. 

Prices of natural gas have also been volatile. While they remain high in 
Europe and Asia due to concerns about Russia’s supply of natural gas, prices 
fell recently in North America. Prices of refined products, such as gasoline 
and diesel, are disproportionally higher than oil prices because of low 
inventories and reduced refining capacity as well as war-related disruptions. 

Looking ahead, Brent oil prices are assumed to fall slowly to US$100 by the 
end of 2024 (Box 2). Prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western 
Canadian Select (WCS) are assumed to follow similar patterns, remaining

US$5 and US$20 below Brent prices, respectively. With this outlook, the 
Bank assumes that the impact of war-related factors on oil prices diminishes 
gradually. 

Risks around the outlook for oil prices are two-sided. Russia may face 
additional sanctions for its invasion of Ukraine that could further reduce 
Russian oil production. This would put more upward pressure on oil prices. 
In contrast, price pressures could be lower if the war-related uncertainty 
dissipates faster than expected or if Russia exports more of its oil to Asia.

Since the April Report, the Bank’s non-energy commodity price index has 
fallen by roughly 15%. Prices for base metals have declined sharply because 
of concerns about global demand, particularly demand from China. Lumber 
prices also fell abruptly due to weakening housing activity in North America. 
Prices of agricultural products have declined, reflecting favourable weather 
that is boosting harvest prospects. Even with the recent decline, prices for 
most non-energy commodities are still likely to stay above their pre-pandemic 
levels over the projection horizon.

High and widespread inflation globally
Inflation is high and becoming more broad-based across goods and services 
in most regions. Short-term inflation expectations are elevated in many 
countries. Surging energy and food prices remain key contributors to inflation. 
Elevated demand is leading to a broadening of inflationary pressures, 
allowing high energy prices to pass through to other prices.

Key inputs to the projection
The Bank of Canada’s projection is always conditional 
on several key assumptions, and changes to these will 
affect the outlook for the Canadian economy. The Bank 
regularly reviews these assumptions and how they may 
impact the economic projection. The key inputs into the 
Bank’s projection are as follows:

  Public health restrictions have largely been removed 

in many countries. It is assumed that remaining 
measures will be lifted over the course of 2022 in 
most of the world. Containment measures in China, 
however, are expected to loosen more gradually—
and even periodically tighten—over 2022 and 2023.

  In Canada, most public health restrictions have been 
lifted. Pandemic-related effects on consumer caution 
and travel are assumed to continue to fade over the 
projection horizon.

  The projection incorporates information from all 

available provincial and federal budgets.

  Oil prices are assumed to gradually decrease over 

the projection horizon from their current elevated 
levels. The price of Brent stays near US$115 per 
barrel for the third quarter of 2022 and then declines 
to about US$100 by the end of 2024. The prices 
for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western 
Canadian Select (WCS) follow similar dynamics, 
with a constant spread below the price for Brent of 
US$5 and US$20, respectively. Brent and WTI oil 
prices are about US$10 above the level assumed in 
the April Report. The spread between WTI and WCS 
is US$5 wider than assumed in the April Report, 
refl ecting a broad-based rise in the premium of light 
oil over heavy oil.

  By convention, the Bank does not forecast the 
exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. 
The Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at 
78 cents US over the projection horizon, close to its 
recent average and slightly below the 79 cents US 
assumed in the April Report.

  The pandemic is having both temporary and lasting 
effects on the supply side of the Canadian economy. 
As in recent reports, the Bank distinguishes between 
supply and potential output to account for the 
episodic nature of some supply decreases that are 
caused by pandemic-related factors, such as public 
health measures and supply chain disruptions.

  The Bank’s assessment of potential output, a 
longer-term concept, looks through the short-
lived effects of factors related to the pandemic. 
As in the April Report, potential output growth 
(excluding temporary factors) is expected to 
average about 2% per year over 2022–24.

  The projection assumes that short-term factors, 
such as supply chain disruptions, are reducing 
the supply of goods and services. These factors 
are assumed to have a maximum negative 
impact of about 2½% on the level of supply in 
the second and third quarters of 2022. This 
effect is expected to start decreasing in the 
fourth quarter and to dissipate beyond the 
projection horizon. Both the magnitude and the 
persistence of the effects of supply disruptions 
are larger than in the April Report. Supply 
chain disruptions are estimated to have larger 
and longer-lasting implications for business 
operations than previously assumed.

  Estimates of overall growth in supply can be 
obtained by combining the estimates of the 
temporary effects of these short-term factors 
with the assessment of potential output. Supply 
growth is projected to be around ¾  % in 2022 
and to average roughly 2¾  % over 2023–24. 

  Gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to 
have grown at a stronger-than-potential pace in 
the second quarter of 2022 amid supply chain 
disruptions. As a result, the Bank estimates that 
the output gap—the difference between GDP and 
supply—was between 0.5% and 1.5% in the second 
quarter. This is further into positive territory than the 
estimate of -0.25% to 0.75% for the fi rst quarter of 
2022.

  The nominal neutral policy interest rate is defi ned as 

the real neutral rate plus 2% for infl ation. The real 
neutral rate is defi ned as the rate consistent with 
both output remaining sustainably at its potential and 
infl ation remaining at target, on an ongoing basis. It 
is a medium- to long-term equilibrium concept. For 
Canada, the projection is based on the assumption 
that the nominal neutral rate is at the midpoint of the 
estimated range of 2% to 3%. This range was last 
reassessed in the April 2022 Report.

Widespread supply shortages continue to be an important source of global 
inflationary pressure. While shipping costs have moderated and supplier 
delivery times have improved slightly in recent months (Chart 2), lockdowns 
in China and the war in Ukraine have caused new supply disruptions. The 
Bank assumes that global supply challenges will ease over the next year.

Inflation is projected to rise further and to peak in most regions in the third 
quarter of this year. It is expected to gradually decline thereafter because, 
in the projection, the effects of past increases in energy and food prices 
dissipate, energy prices decline, supply challenges ease, and demand slows. 

Tighter global financial conditions 
Global financial conditions are more restrictive than in the April Report. 
Equity prices have declined, and corporate bond spreads have widened 
(Chart 3). Global government bond yields have experienced significant 
volatility since the April Report. They initially rose as central banks in 
advanced and emerging economies continued to tighten monetary policy. 
Yields on longer-term government bonds have retreated somewhat over the 
past few weeks due to concerns about the prospects for global growth but 
remain higher than in April. The Canadian dollar depreciated against the 
US dollar, although less so than most other currencies.

Sharp slowdown after robust growth in the 
United States
The US economy is in excess demand, and the labour market is tight. Job 
openings are near record levels, and the unemployment rate is close to a 
40-year low. Wage growth has been rising rapidly over the past year, though 
not by enough to keep up with inflation. However, consumption and housing 
activity have weakened considerably in recent months as high inflation and 
the rising path of interest rates reduce demand. 

To combat high inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased the target range 
for the federal funds rate by 150 basis points since the start of 2022. In June, 
the Federal Reserve also started reducing the size of its balance sheet—a 
process known as quantitative tightening. 

The US economy is on track to grow by about 2% in 2022, supported by the 
ongoing recovery and households spending their previously accumulated 
savings. Consumption and business investment are expected to slow as 
higher interest rates work their way through the economy. GDP growth in the 
United States is anticipated to moderate to about 1% in 2023 and in 2024.

War disruptions and rising inflation in the euro area
The war in Ukraine and associated uncertainty are weighing heavily on 
the euro area economy. Surging energy prices and trade disruptions are 
dampening production. High inflation is eroding household purchasing power 
and hurting consumer confidence. In response to elevated inflation, the 
European Central Bank ended its net asset purchases and announced plans to 
raise its policy rates in the coming months. Overall, growth is projected to slow 
from 2¾% in 2022 to 1% in 2023. Growth is expected to pick up in 2024 as the 
effects of the war and elevated energy prices fade.

Lockdowns in China 
China’s economy likely contracted in the second quarter because of strict 
measures to contain outbreaks of COVID-19. Lockdowns in important 
manufacturing and trading hubs temporarily hampered production and 
trade and have compounded challenges with global supply chains. Mobility 
restrictions and the ongoing correction in the property sector are weighing on 
domestic demand. 

Authorities have introduced several policies to stimulate growth, including 
additional infrastructure spending, targeted tax cuts and lower mortgage 
rates. China’s economy should rebound in the third quarter of 2022 because 
of this policy stimulus and the recent easing of lockdown measures. 
Uncertainty about the growth outlook remains high, given the fragility of the 
property sector and the risk of even more intense lockdowns if another wave 
of COVID-19 occurs.

Multiple headwinds in emerging-market economies 
The war in Ukraine, high energy prices and, to a lesser extent, China’s 
lockdowns are hampering growth in oil-importing emerging-market 
economies (EMEs), particularly in Europe and Asia. The sharp tightening of 
financial conditions in many EMEs is also weighing on domestic demand. As 
a result, growth is expected to moderate in 2022 and 2023 before picking up 
in 2024 as the effects of these headwinds dissipate. 

Activity in the rest-of-the-world group is held back by tighter global financial 
conditions and by the sharp contraction of the Russian economy due to 
economic sanctions. However, other oil-exporting countries are expected to 
benefit from increased oil revenues.

Canadian economy
Canadian economy

Inflation continues to rise and broaden in Canada, reflecting widespread 
cost pressures. Global factors—including high prices for energy, food and 
tradable goods—are driving most of the surge. In addition, excess demand 
in the Canadian economy is playing a more significant role. It is making firms 
more likely to pass cost increases on to consumers, leading to a broadening 
of inflationary pressures.

Businesses and consumers increasingly think that inflation will be higher for 
longer, and they are more uncertain about the future path of inflation. This 
points to an increasing risk that elevated inflation will become entrenched.

CPI inflation is forecast to average around 8% in the middle quarters of 2022. 
It is then projected to ease to roughly 3% by the end of 2023 and return to 
target by the end of 2024. Inflation declines as the impact of higher energy 
prices dissipates, supply challenges recede, and monetary policy in Canada 
and abroad reduces domestic and foreign demand. In this projection, inflation 
is considerably higher and more persistent than in the April Report (see 
Box 1 on page 3 and the Appendix on page 26).
Growth has been robust over the past year as the Canadian economy 
recovered from the worst effects of the pandemic. Strong housing markets, 
high commodity prices and the easing of public health restrictions have 
boosted economic activity. However, economic growth is now showing signs 
of slowing. The effects of higher prices and interest rates have begun to 
weigh on household spending. In particular, a sharp slowdown in the housing 
market is underway. 

Overall, economic growth is forecast to be strong in 2022 at about 3½% and 
to moderate to about 1¾% in 2023 and 2½% in 2024 (Table 2). Growth slows 
largely due to the impact of high inflation and tighter financial conditions on 
consumption and housing activity. A weaker outlook for global growth also 
weighs on exports and business investment. The Canadian growth outlook is 
revised down in 2022 and 2023 relative to the April Report.

CPI inflation at a 40-year high 
CPI inflation has continued to rise and is now expected to reach about 8% in 
the third quarter of 2022 (Chart 4). Global factors remain the largest drivers. 
These include Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has further pushed up 
food and gasoline prices. As well, tradable goods prices, including high 
freight costs, continue to put pressure on global costs.

Domestic demand conditions are also contributing to elevated inflation. The 
pandemic saw a profound shift in consumer preferences toward goods and 
low-contact services. In addition to the strength in goods prices, shelter 
prices, which include rent, have risen significantly over the past year. With 
the recent removal of health restrictions, prices for hard-to-distance services, 
such as traveller accommodations, have also been increasing. 

Overall, demand remains robust. It has enabled many firms to raise prices—
passing on to consumers higher costs, including the recent spike in energy 
prices. As a result, inflation has broadened, with almost three-quarters of 
CPI categories growing above 3% and more than half growing above 5% 
(Chart 5). 
Measures of core inflation have increased further since the April Report. CPI-
trim, CPI-median and CPI-common are at 5.4%, 4.9% and 3.9%, respectively. 
The rise in CPI-common—which puts more weight on services and domestic 
conditions—reflects growing excess demand in Canada.

Higher and more dispersed inflation expectations
Inflation expectations have a direct impact on inflation because they 
are factored in when firms set wages and prices. To assess inflation 
expectations, the Bank relies on various survey results and market-based 
information. Consumer and business surveys indicate that median inflation 
expectations over the next two years have increased (Chart 6). Inflation 
expectations of professional forecasters have also increased at the two-year 
horizon, albeit much more modestly than those of households and firms. 
Household and business surveys also show a wider distribution of inflation 
expectations among respondents. In particular, a large number of participants 
in the Business Outlook Survey (BOS) for the second quarter of 2022—
considerably more than in previous surveys—now think that inflation will be 
at or well above 4% over the next two years (Chart 7).1 These survey results 
suggest greater uncertainty about the future path of inflation, increasing the 
risk that inflation expectations become de-anchored.

1  As well, the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations shows that the distribution among household 

survey respondents has also widened. However, the increase in dispersion for households is less 
clear-cut than that of businesses.

Survey participants continue to point to global factors as the primary reason 
for higher expected inflation. However, they increasingly mention domestic 
factors, such as strong demand and persistent labour shortages. 

The surveys show that inflation expectations at longer horizons have increased 
but remain in line with their pre-pandemic levels. While BOS results indicate 
that businesses now think inflation will remain above 2% for longer, the majority 
of respondents still expect inflation to return to target within the next three 
years. Market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are also in 
line with the Bank’s inflation target. The five-year break-even inflation rate has 
decreased recently to about 2¼%. At this level, it is consistent with a rise in 
inflation over the near term followed by a decline toward the 2% target.

Tighter financial conditions 
The Bank has tightened monetary policy in response to the strength of 
inflationary pressures, beginning to increase its policy rate in March and 
initiating quantitative tightening on April 25.2

Higher policy rates, market expectations of further rate increases, and 
quantitative tightening in Canada and elsewhere have contributed to rapid 
increases in borrowing costs for businesses and households (Chart 8). 
Households seeking to renew or take on a new mortgage now face five-
year fixed mortgage rates at their highest level since 2010. According to the 
Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations for the second quarter of 2022, 
consumers expect that accessing credit 12 months from now will be more 
difficult.

2  Under quantitative tightening, the Bank is shrinking its balance sheet by letting maturing bonds roll off. By 
July 8, the Bank’s holdings of Government of Canada bonds had declined from around $425 billion at the 
time of the last Report to about $400 billion, and settlement balances had dropped from around $230 billion 
to about $175 billion during the same period. Quantitative tightening complements the increase in the policy 
rate by reducing the degree of monetary stimulus. This occurs in a predictable way because information 
about the Bank’s holdings of maturing bonds is available to the public.

Slower growth in the third quarter  
Following several robust quarters, economic growth is expected to slow 
from about 4% in the second quarter to about 2% in the third (Table 3 and 
Chart 9). Consumption growth moderates as the boost from pent-up demand 
for in-person services eases. High inflation is also squeezing household 
budgets, and rising interest rates are increasing the cost to finance 
purchases of big-ticket items and making savings more attractive.

Last observation: May 2022

Housing market activity is weakening substantially from its unsustainable 
pace during the pandemic (Chart 10). Resales are falling across most 
regions and prices are declining in some markets as borrowing rates rise and 
household confidence declines. Some areas outside downtown cores, which 
had previously seen large price increases, are now experiencing a decline in 
prices.3

Exports and business investment continue to grow strongly, with the latter 
expected to reach pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter. Recent strength 
in US industrial production and an easing of travel restrictions should provide 
support for exports over the near term. As well, elevated energy prices are 
boosting exports and investment in the energy sector as firms seek to make 
full use of existing production capacity. Near-term business investment is 
also supported by a ramping up of work at LNG Canada’s Kitimat site and 
continued work modernizing electric vehicle manufacturing.

Canadian economy in excess demand
A broad set of measures indicates that the economy is operating beyond its 
productive capacity. 

The labour market is tight along all dimensions.4 Most indicators suggest the 
labour market has surpassed maximum sustainable employment (Chart 11), 
including the unemployment rate, which is at a series low. In turn, labour 
shortages are pushing wages higher. In the BOS for the second quarter of 
2022, a near-record number of firms see labour shortages as more intense 
than they were a year ago. The ratios of vacancies and job postings to 

3  The move to remote work in many sectors of the economy, combined with a desire for more living space, 

likely encouraged many households to seek properties away from downtown areas. For more details,

pandemic,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2022-7 (June 2022).

unemployed workers have also risen to record levels. As a result of this 
tightness, wage growth is strengthening and broadening across sectors 
(Chart 12).  
Businesses continue to report capacity constraints, including labour 
shortages and supply chain challenges (Chart 13). Supply constraints are 
still weighing on production and sales. This is particularly acute in the auto 
sector, where it continues to be difficult to source semiconductors and get 
motor vehicles to retailers. 

The Bank estimates that the output gap—the difference between GDP and 
supply—has risen further into positive territory in the second quarter of 2022, 
to between 0.5% and 1.5%. This is up from the estimate of -0.25% to 0.75% 
for the first quarter (Box 2). With economic growth anticipated to be roughly 
in line with supply growth in the third quarter, the economy remains in excess 
demand.

Slower demand coupled with pickup in supply 
The Canadian economy is anticipated to grow by about 3½% over 2022, 
boosted by pent-up domestic demand. Growth then slows to about 1¾% 
in 2023 in response to higher interest rates, lower commodity prices and 
declining foreign demand. Economic growth reaches 2½% in 2024 as 
household spending improves.

Supply growth is forecast to rebound from about ¾% in 2022 to about 2¾% 
on average over 2023–24. It strengthens over the projection horizon as global 
transportation bottlenecks and shortages of critical inputs ease. The easing 
of supply constraints, together with robust business investment, drives a 
rebound in productivity from its recent lows. Meanwhile, higher immigration 
will boost labour supply.

Excess demand in the Canadian economy eases over the projection horizon 
as demand moderates and supply strengthens. The output gap is expected 
to close in 2023 and move into modest excess supply in 2024.

Inflation lower in late 2022 and at target by the end of 
2024
Inflation is expected to decline over the projection horizon (Chart 14 and 
Chart 15). Inflation falls from about 8% in the third quarter of 2022 to roughly 
3% by the end of 2023. A decline in oil prices and lower house prices pull 
down quarter-over-quarter inflation in the second half of 2022. This helps lay 
the foundation for the decline in inflation. Inflation returns to the 2% target by 
the end of 2024 as global price pressures and domestic demand ease.

Inflation is forecast to ease, reflecting several forces. Oil prices are projected 
to fall gradually, with the Brent price back down to $100 by the end of 2024. 
Global supply bottlenecks abate, and the tightening of monetary policy 
abroad weighs on foreign demand. Consequently, inflation of tradable goods 
prices declines. 

Higher interest rates in Canada will soften demand, reducing domestic 
inflationary pressures. Inflation of services prices, including shelter price 
inflation, eases. Considerable uncertainty continues to surround this outlook, 
as has been the case throughout the pandemic (see the Appendix on 
page 26). 

Sizable pullback in housing activity 
The contraction in housing activity is expected to continue in the second 
half of 2022 and into 2023. Resales and house prices decline as borrowing 
rates rise and the pandemic-induced boost in demand wanes. Residential 
construction, including renovations, is also predicted to drop over the 
next year. Housing activity and prices are forecast to stabilize later in the 
projection horizon as both population and income growth boost housing 
demand.  

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONeTARy POLICy RePORT  •  JULy 2022

CANADIAN eCONOMy  20 

Softer consumption growth 
Consumption grows at a modest pace over the projection horizon. 
Spending on travel and other hard-to-distance services rises as consumers 
become less concerned about physical distancing. This will contribute to 
a rebalancing of the consumption of goods and services (Chart 16). A 
drawdown in some of the savings accumulated during the pandemic also 
supports household spending.5 For example, motor vehicle purchases are 
expected to pick up as supply shortages resolve and pent-up demand is met.

However, consumption growth is anticipated to slow from its current strong 
pace. High inflation means that households will allocate more of their 
disposable income to necessities such as food and gasoline, leaving them 
with less money to spend on other items. And higher interest rates mean that 
some households will postpone major purchases, pay down debt or save 
more.6 As well, some households—particularly those that took on a sizable 
mortgage when rates were lower—will face significantly larger payments 
when they renew their mortgages. The slowdown in housing activity will also 
weigh on the consumption of goods such as furniture and appliances.

Moderate export growth
Export growth is expected to remain strong throughout the remainder of 2022, 
boosted by elevated commodity prices and a pickup in international travel. 
Later in the projection horizon, export growth slows as foreign demand declines 
(Chart 17).
Non-energy exports should grow solidly as global supply disruptions 
dissipate. However, exports of motor vehicles will slow growth in the 
second half of 2023 and in 2024 when some manufacturing facilities close 
temporarily to retool for the production of electric vehicles. Exports and 
imports of services strengthen and reach pre-pandemic levels in 2024 while 
international travel continues to recover.

5  However, consumers are incentivized to save more than previously expected given increased 

uncertainty and higher interest rates offering better returns.

6  These assessments are consistent with results from the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations—

Second Quarter 2022.

Energy exports are projected to grow strongly due to high prices and 
increased transportation capacity. Expected expansions in pipeline 
capacity—including the Trans Mountain Expansion project—and in volumes 
of crude-by-rail will support growth later in the projection horizon.

Imports are anticipated to remain solid, backed by robust business 
investment, ongoing restocking by businesses, and firms’ desire to hold more 
inventory to buffer themselves against future supply disruptions.

Robust business investment 
Outside the oil and gas sector, the investment outlook is bolstered by solid 
demand, robust business confidence and a push to alleviate capacity 
constraints (Chart 18). This outlook is consistent with the results of the BOS, 
with firms planning investments in digital technologies to improve productivity 
given tight labour markets and high input costs.  

Investment growth in the oil and gas sector is anticipated to be robust, 
though more muted than during past periods of high prices. Producers 
of conventional oil and natural gas are expected to focus on expanding 
production capacity in fields where infrastructure is readily available. 
Investment in the oil sands is expected to be limited to improving the use of 
existing capacity and expanding current projects. Oil sands projects tend to 
require more capital and emit higher levels of greenhouse gases, making 
them sensitive to uncertainty about long-term demand and the transition to a 
low-carbon economy.

RISKS TO THe INFLATION OUTLOOK  23 

Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook

The global economy faces many challenges. The pace of monetary policy 
tightening has accelerated in many countries as inflationary pressures have 
continued to rise and broaden. These pressures are contributing to greater 
volatility in financial markets and growing concerns about the path for the 
global recovery. Also, even as disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic 
have continued to ease, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine remains a major source 
of uncertainty. 

Some of the risks identified in previous reports have been partially 
incorporated into the projection. The base-case scenario includes more 
persistent supply challenges, greater pass-through of cost increases, tighter 
global financial conditions and the impact of higher inflation expectations.

The Bank sees two main risks to the outlook for inflation. On the upside, if 
left unchecked, persistently high inflation could result in a wage-price spiral. 
On the downside, the slowdown in the global economy could be more severe 
than expected, especially if the US economy slows more than expected. 

Drawing from a larger set of risks, this section discusses other risks that 
may affect the projected path of inflation. The upside risks are of greater 
concern because inflation is persistently high, and evidence is mounting that 
expectations of inflation are drifting upward.

(i)  Main upside risk: Higher inflation becomes entrenched (↑)
Until inflation drops significantly, the risk is greater that Canadians will 
believe it will stay high over the long term. Higher inflation expectations 
could lead to more pervasive increases in prices and labour costs, 
and these in turn could become embedded in higher inflation. Box 3 
provides a scenario of what could happen if longer-term inflation 
expectations become de-anchored and a wage-price spiral takes 
hold. In this case, mutually reinforcing wage and price pressures 
would amplify high inflation, and a greater degree of monetary policy 
tightening and a more pronounced slowdown of the economy would be 
needed to bring inflation back to target. 

(ii)  Main downside risk: More severe global slowdown (↓)
The global economy could slow more than anticipated. The euro 
area is at risk of recession as energy shortages lead to even higher 
prices, undermining consumer demand. Economy-wide disruptions 
could occur if rationing is implemented. At the same time, the impact 
of tighter financial conditions on household confidence and spending 
could be greater than expected. This could lead to slower growth in 
many regions. If more forceful actions are required to restrain inflation 

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONeTARy POLICy RePORT  •  JULy 2022

RISKS TO THe INFLATION OUTLOOK  24 

in the United States, US growth could slow more than projected. As 
well, lockdowns in China could be more frequent and have a larger 
negative impact on growth than currently assumed. These shocks 
would be transmitted to the Canadian economy through weaker foreign 
demand, lower commodity prices and a deterioration in the terms of 
trade.

Other risks
(iii)  Stronger household spending in Canada (↑)

In the base-case scenario, consumption grows at a modest pace 
and housing activity sees a sizable pullback. For many households, 
higher inflation and interest rates are squeezing budgets. However, 
a considerable proportion of households have accumulated large 
excess savings and are therefore more capable of absorbing higher 
prices. With the reopening of the economy, the boost from pent-up 
demand could be more sustained than anticipated if this group spends 
even more of its accumulated savings. Consumption and residential 
investment would then be stronger than projected and would contribute 
to greater inflationary pressures.

(iv)  Reversal of increases in goods prices (↓)

The base-case scenario assumes that the spike in goods prices since 
the beginning of the pandemic will persist. However, these prices could 
decline as supply chain bottlenecks dissipate and demand moderates. 
Oil prices and transportation costs could decrease more sharply 
than expected or growth in goods consumption could slow more than 
projected, particularly in the United States. If either of these scenarios 
occurs, inflation would be lower than projected.

Some large global retailers are reporting high levels of inventory after 
building up their stocks to avoid shortages. This could suggest some 
downside risk if retailers offer deep discounts to clear excess inventory.

(v)  Sharper decline in housing activity and consumption in 

Canada (↓)
While the base case projects a significant decline in housing 
activity, a steep drop in homebuyer sentiment could amplify the 
decline in house prices. Significant drops in house prices would 
reduce household wealth and access to credit as well as undermine 
consumer confidence. This would weigh on demand, especially from 
highly indebted households that have taken out sizable mortgages to 
purchase a home. Higher borrowing rates and reduced access to credit 
could also have larger-than-expected dampening effects on household 
spending, business investment and employment.

 
 

Box 3

Scenario with a wage-price spiral
With infl ation high and broadening, infl ation expectations 
have moved upward. These rising infl ation expectations 
are occurring while the labour market is tight and wage 
growth is strong. This increases the risk that a self-
reinforcing wage-price spiral could ensue—a key upside 
risk to the infl ation outlook.

In this risk scenario, when infl ation remains persistently 
high, more households and fi rms base their infl ation 
expectations only on the most recent infl ation data. 
As a result, longer-term infl ation expectations become 
de-anchored and stay above the target.1 

De-anchored infl ation expectations lead fi rms to set 
prices even higher. Similarly, in response to higher 
expected infl ation, workers bargain for persistently 
higher wage growth to protect against anticipated losses 
in purchasing power. The resulting stronger wage 
growth feeds into production costs and prompts fi rms to 
raise prices even further. This process boosts infl ation 
expectations, perpetuating the spiral.

The longer infl ation remains well above target, the 
more likely it is that a wage-price spiral will occur. This 
likelihood also increases if fi rms have multi-year wage 
agreements in place with high wage increases in every 
year. 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONeTARy POLICy RePORT  •  JULy 2022

RISKS TO THe INFLATION OUTLOOK  25 

Increased risk of recession
This risk scenario examines what could happen if a 
wage-price spiral occurred. The spiral prompts infl ation 
expectations, wages and prices to ratchet upward. 
With de-anchored expectations, infl ation stays higher 
than it would have been with easing demand and fl at or 
declining commodity prices.

To break the vicious circle, monetary policy works 
to re-anchor long-term infl ation expectations to the 
2% target. This is done by setting monetary policy much 
tighter than in the base case and creating additional 
excess supply. 

Chart 3-A (panel a) shows that, in this illustrative risk 
scenario, overall infl ation peaks at 8.6%, higher than in 
the base case. By the end of 2023, infl ation is at 6%, 
about 3 percentage points higher than in the base case. 
Growth of real gross domestic product is signifi cantly 
weaker, reaching a trough of about -2.5%, and Canada 
experiences a four-quarter recession (Chart 3-A, 
panel b). 

The Bank of Canada is keenly aware of the possibility of 
a wage-price spiral and is fi rmly committed to ensuring 
that this dynamic does not set in. This requires setting 
monetary policy much tighter than in the base case to 
ensure that long-run infl ation expectations remain well 
anchored. With infl ation expectations fi rmly anchored to 
the infl ation target, the likelihood of a wage-price spiral 
is greatly diminished. 

1  This contrasts with the base case, which has long-run infl ation expectations 

remaining well anchored to the infl ation target.

The Bank of Canada, like other central banks, has underpredicted inflation 
since spring 2021 (Chart A-1). Precisely quantifying the sources of inflation 
forecast errors is complex because many factors influence inflation at the 
same time, making it difficult to fully disentangle them. That said, global 
factors appear to explain about two-thirds of missed inflation through higher 
commodity prices, increased supply shortages and rising shipping costs 
(Chart A-2). The faster-than-expected recovery in the Canadian economy 
added to the Bank’s forecast errors but cannot explain most of the surprise: 
about one-quarter of the miss on inflation is explained by domestic factors, 
mostly housing costs.

Global shocks behind most errors
Higher-than-expected commodity prices 
The Bank typically uses a flat assumption about oil prices over its two- to 
three-year projection horizon. This assumption is based on work by Alquist 
et al. (2013), which shows that this approach was providing more accurate 
forecasts than other methods.7

Since 2020, however, the flat assumption has consistently underpredicted 
oil prices (Chart A-3). Commodity price effects alone account for over 40% 
of the Bank’s total underprediction of inflation. Refinery margins recently 
deviated unexpectedly from their historical levels, leading to higher gasoline 
prices. And the Russian invasion of Ukraine has driven prices for oil and 
natural gas even higher.

In the past, a strong correlation existed between oil prices and the Canadian 
dollar: as oil prices rose, the dollar appreciated. This helped offset the 
inflationary impact of higher energy prices by making imports into Canada 
cheaper. But recently, this relationship has not held, which means that higher 
oil prices have had an even greater effect on inflation.8 

In addition, other commodity prices have been unexpectedly high. For 
example, agricultural commodity prices have surged since 2021, largely due 
to unpredictable severe weather events. And the war in Ukraine has spiked 
wheat prices in particular.

As well, higher energy prices affected shipping costs, contributing to the 
steep rise in the price of goods globally.

7  See R. Alquist, L. Kilian and R. J. Vigfusson, “Forecasting the Price of Oil,” in Handbook of Economic 

Forecasting, 2A, edited by G. Elliott and A. Timmermann (Amsterdam: North-Holland, 2013): 427–507. In 
recent reports, the Bank has deviated from the flat assumption about oil prices given the high volatility of 
oil prices due to the war in Ukraine.

8  This relationship may have broken down in part because of uncertainty about demand for oil and natural 

gas in the long term. See T. Gravelle, “The perfect storm” (speech to the Association des économistes 
québécois, Montréal, Quebec, May 12, 2022).

Stronger-than-anticipated tradable goods prices 
Instead of weakening as in past downturns, US consumer demand for 
goods unexpectedly surged well beyond pre-pandemic levels (Chart A-4).9 
Supported by fiscal policy measures, US household incomes turned out to be 
higher than anticipated. As well, the extent to which households shifted their 
spending into low-contact sectors was unexpected. Overall, strong foreign 
demand for tradable goods, such as appliances and furniture, has pushed up 
prices globally, including for Canadian consumers.

At the same time, the pandemic led to factory and port shutdowns around 
the world, upending supply chains for goods. The Bank had expected supply 
chains to be restored quickly once initial lockdown measures were lifted. 
However, further waves of the virus have caused continued disruptions, 
both globally and in Canada. In addition, the impact of supply challenges on 
consumer prices has been greater than anticipated. All told, roughly 20% of 
the forecast errors are related to global supply chain pressures.  

9  Because the US economy is roughly 10 times larger than the Canadian economy, the impact of strong 

US demand on goods inventory is much larger than would have been the case if Canadian demand had 
rebounded by as much.

Faster-than-expected recovery in Canada
The fiscal and monetary policy response to the pandemic had stronger 
effects than initially anticipated.10 Instead of declining, household disposable 
incomes and consumer confidence rose. The inability to spend on in-person 
services also meant that savings soared for some households. These factors 
contributed to more robust demand for goods than anticipated.

The large accumulation of savings, low mortgage rates and changes in 
homebuyer preferences led to house prices growing by more than had been 
expected given the amount of slack in the economy. The sharp rise in house 
prices has boosted consumer price index inflation by 1.2 percentage points 
on average since the middle of 2021.

The early arrival of vaccines in spring 2021 sped up the economic recovery. 
This was evident in the labour market because people were able to return to 
work faster than anticipated.

In 2022, with the lifting of most public health restrictions, consumer 
cautiousness faded more quickly than in past downturns, and pent-up 
demand led to robust consumption growth. With the economy already in 
excess demand, the effects of domestic demand on inflation became more 
important. These effects are contributing to a broadening of high inflation into 
non-shelter services such as traveller accommodation and transportation.

Overall, commodity prices are the largest factor, explaining about 45% of 
the forecast errors over the past year. Global supply shortages and shipping 
costs as well as domestic factors are also important, each contributing over 
20%. That said, it is important to note that these are rough estimates that will 
evolve over time.

Canada’s Inflation-Control Strategy1
Inflation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote 

the economic and financial well-being of Canadians.

pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s 
outlook, including risks to the projection, are published four 
times per year in the Monetary Policy Report.

  Canada’s experience with inflation targeting since 1991 has 

shown that the best way to foster confidence in the value 
of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth, 
employment gains and improved living standards is by keeping 
inflation low, stable and predictable.

Inflation targeting is symmetric and flexible
  Canada’s inflation-targeting approach is symmetric, which 

means that the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising 
above or falling below the 2 percent target.

  In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 

Canada’s inflation-control target for a further five-year period, 
ending December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the 
consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 percent midpoint 
of the control range of 1 to 3 percent.

  Canada’s inflation-targeting framework is flexible. Typically, 

the Bank seeks to return inflation to target over a horizon of six 
to eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for 
returning inflation to target will vary depending on the nature 
and persistence of the shocks buffeting the economy.

The monetary policy instrument
  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes in the 

target for the overnight rate of interest.2 These changes are 
transmitted to the economy through their influence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate, 
which affect total demand for Canadian goods and services. 
The balance between this demand and the economy’s 
production capacity is, over time, the primary determinant of 
inflation pressures in the economy.

  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight 
quarters—to work their way through the economy and have 
their full effect on inflation. For this reason, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent com-
munications, the Bank regularly reports its perspective on 
the forces at work on the economy and their implications for 
inflation. The Monetary Policy Report is a key element of this 
approach. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight 

Monitoring inflation
  In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in 
indirect taxes such as GST, can cause sizable fluctuations in 
CPI.

  In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through 

such transitory movements in CPI inflation and focuses on a 
set of “core” inflation measures that better reflect the under-
lying trend of inflation. In this sense, these measures act as an 
operational guide to help the Bank achieve the CPI inflation 
target. They are not a replacement for CPI inflation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core inflation are CPI-
trim, which excludes CPI components whose rates of change 
in a given month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which 
corresponds to the price change located at the 50th percentile 
(in terms of basket weight) of the distribution of price changes; 
and CPI-common, which uses a statistical procedure to track 
common price changes across categories in the CPI basket.

Inflation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide additional  monetary 

stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website, 
describes these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Global Economy

Trade conflicts are weakening the world economy. Global economic growth 
is expected to slow to below 3 percent in 2019, its weakest pace since 
the 2007–09 global economic and financial crisis (Table 1). The slowdown 
has been most pronounced in business investment and the manufac-
turing sector and has coincided with a contraction in global trade (Chart 1). 
Despite the manufacturing slowdown, unemployment rates continue to be 
near historical lows in many advanced economies, as growth in employment 
in service sectors has remained resilient.

The United States and China have announced additional trade actions since 
the July Monetary Policy Report. Although negotiations have recently shown 
some signs of progress, global uncertainty has been increasing. These fac-
tors have contributed to a further deterioration in growth prospects and a 
fall in commodity prices. In response to weaker outlooks and lower inflation 
expectations, many central banks have eased monetary policy. These central 
bank actions have helped maintain financial conditions that support growth.

Last observation: 2019Q2

Growth is projected to strengthen modestly to around 31/4 percent by 2021, 
with a pickup in some emerging-market economies (EMEs) more than off-
setting slower growth in the United States and China (Table 1).1

Trade conflicts hurting global investment
A slowdown in business investment and trade was expected following an 
unsustainably strong performance in 2017 and early 2018, but trade con-
flicts have been a further drag. Tariff increases and retaliatory measures 
have raised firms’ costs, disrupted global supply chains, created uncertainty 
about future trade relationships and reduced business confidence (Chart 2).

The Bank estimates that trade measures and related uncertainty would 
remove about 1.3 percent from the level of global gross domestic product 
(GDP) by the end of 2021 in the absence of any monetary policy actions.2 This 
estimate is about 0.5 percentage points larger than it was in the July Report.3

Sector-specific developments, notably in auto and consumer electronics 
industries, have also contributed to the underperformance of global busi-
ness investment. 

1  The Bank’s base-case scenario continues to assume an orderly Brexit, with modest negative effects from 
uncertainty. It also includes the effects of the additional tariff increases imposed by the United States and 
China since the July Report, which are assumed to remain in place over the projection horizon. 

2  Escalating trade measures and related uncertainty have been a drag on the global economy since 2017. 

The Bank estimates that about one-third of the total effect on global GDP reported above has already 
occurred.

3  The upside scenario in Box 2 of the July Report can be used as an estimate of the total drag on the 

global economy resulting from trade policy and related uncertainty. Differences between what is 
reported in the current base-case scenario and what is implied in the box are due to new trade actions, 
additional uncertainty and rounding.

Financial markets reacting to weakening global growth
More than 35 central banks in advanced economies and EMEs have eased 
monetary policy since the July Report in reaction to weakening growth pros-
pects and soft inflation expectations. Markets are expecting further mon-
etary policy easing in upcoming months.

The ongoing trade war between the United States and China has raised 
investor appetite for high-quality assets since July. At the same time, 
investors continue to search for yield in the global low interest rate environ-
ment. As a result, the demand for US government bonds has increased. 
US bond yields are, on balance, down but have increased from their recent 
lows. Yields in other major jurisdictions are about the same as in July. The 
higher demand for US assets has also contributed to the ongoing strength 
of the US dollar against other major currencies. Meanwhile, the Canadian 
dollar has traded in a narrow range against the US dollar while appreciating 
against other currencies.

Other financial indicators, including equity prices and credit spreads, remain 
close to their July levels even though global growth prospects have deteri-
orated. This may reflect the effects of additional monetary policy stimulus. 
Overall, financial market indicators are consistent with a modest cyclical 
slowing of global activity.

US economy to grow at about potential
The US economy has been growing at a moderate pace, supported by 
robust consumer spending, a strong labour market and healthy wage gains. 
In addition, after a prolonged period of weakness, the housing market is 
showing signs of improvement. However, rising trade protectionism has 
increased uncertainty in the business environment. Growth in manufacturing 
production, an important source of demand for Canadian exports, has 
decreased over the past year, and business investment has slowed sharply 
(Chart 3). The decline in manufacturing production has been broad-based,

including significant weakness in sectors that rely on Chinese imports, such 
as chemicals and machinery. Activity in sectors that are less affected by the 
trade conflict, such as services, has remained relatively resilient.

Core personal consumption expenditure price inflation rose to 1.8 percent in 
August, from about 1.5 percent earlier in the year. Looking ahead, the tariff 
increases on Chinese imports announced in August target a larger share of 
consumer products than previous rounds did. These increases are therefore 
expected to have a greater impact on consumer prices.

The US Federal Reserve provided additional monetary stimulus to mitigate 
the adverse impacts of global developments amid muted inflation expecta-
tions. As well, the new US federal budget agreement raises the level of gov-
ernment spending relative to what was assumed in the July Report. Overall, 
the outlook for GDP growth is little changed from July, with growth moder-
ating toward potential over the projection horizon.

Euro area losing momentum
Recent indicators point to weaker growth in the euro area than anticipated in 
the July Report. Global trade developments and other geopolitical risks are 
weighing on business confidence and on exports. A contraction in manufac-
turing output, and particularly disruptions in the auto sector, has raised the 
risk of a recession in Germany. So far, household spending and employment 
in the non-manufacturing sector have been relatively resilient, particularly in 
regions less dependent on exports.

Core inflation and inflation expectations remain tepid. In response to the 
modest growth outlook and persistent weakness in inflation, the European 
Central Bank has cut its deposit facility rate and restarted asset purchases 
(quantitative easing). In this context, GDP growth is expected to average 
about 1 percent in 2019 and 2020, before rising to close to 11/2 percent in 
2021.

Growth to continue slowing in China
The Chinese economy has been facing important domestic and external 
headwinds. Financial system vulnerabilities from high debt levels remain a 
concern. Regulatory efforts to address them have dampened growth. This 
drag has been exacerbated by the escalating trade dispute with the United 
States. Although policy support has provided some offset, industrial pro-
duction and investment in private fixed assets have slowed over the past 
year. This has led to a contraction in imports of manufactured products and 
non-petroleum raw materials (Chart 4). The increase in tariffs since July, as 
well as related uncertainty, will likely have a further adverse effect on China’s 
economy.

GDP growth remains subdued in other oil-importing EMEs. Economic activity 
in emerging Asia has been restrained by the manufacturing slowdown in 
China and by weak demand for electronic goods. India’s economy is being 
constrained by a credit crunch, and growth remains weak in Latin America. 
Growth in EMEs is nonetheless expected to improve modestly over the pro-
jection horizon as economic activity normalizes in India and Latin America.

In oil-exporting countries, growth is expected to pick up over the projection 
horizon. Oil production should stabilize following cuts implemented by some 
members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) 
at the start of 2019.4

Growth concerns weighing on commodity prices
Many commodity prices have decreased since July due to concerns over 
global demand (Chart 5). Changing market perceptions about the status 
of US–China trade talks also drove sharp fluctuations in some commodity 
prices. The recent average for the price of Brent crude oil, the global bench-
mark, is US$5 per barrel lower than assumed in the July Report (Box 1, 
page 8). The decrease occurred despite the attacks on processing facilities 

4  The current OPEC production agreement is effective through March 2020. The base-case projection 

assumes roughly the same level of OPEC oil production in 2020 as in 2019.

in Saudi Arabia, which temporarily disrupted production and increased 
regional tensions. Meanwhile, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil 
has remained relatively unchanged, as new pipeline capacity in the United 
States improved access to markets.

Uncertainty around future oil prices remains elevated. Prices could fall fur-
ther if OPEC members decide to relax production cuts in 2020. However, 
an escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East would put upward 
pressure on prices.

The spread between WTI and Western Canadian Select has remained close 
to US$15 since July. Oil inventories in Western Canada have fallen over the 
past six months despite an easing in the mandatory production curtailments 
in Alberta. This drop is due to a pickup in shipments by rail.

Global growth concerns have also put downward pressure on the prices of 
many base metals. One exception is the price of nickel, which has risen by 
about 40 percent since July. This change reflects more restrictive export 
policies from Indonesia, a key supplier.

Canadian Economy

The Canadian economy grew at a moderate pace over the past year, sup-
ported by a healthy labour market and the recent turnaround in housing. 
However, global trade conflicts and related uncertainty dampened busi-
ness investment and export activities, and investment in the energy sector 
continued to decline. The impact on growth of both global headwinds and 
energy transportation constraints is expected to diminish, and the pace of 
economic expansion should gradually pick up in 2020 and 2021.

The overall picture masks volatility across quarters. Growth in the second 
quarter was particularly strong. The Bank estimates, however, that it is being 
pulled down in the second half of 2019 by an outright decline in exports and 
business investment.

In 2020 and 2021, Canada’s economy is anticipated to grow near potential. 
Consumer spending is projected to increase at a steady pace, and housing 
activity to continue its ongoing recovery. Overall, investment and exports 
are anticipated to grow moderately. In the energy sector, investment is fore-
cast to stabilize, and oil exports should improve as pipeline and rail capacity 
gradually expands.

Compared with the projection in the July Report, economic growth has 
been revised up for 2019, but revised down for 2020 and 2021 (Table 2 
and Box 1). Altogether, the level of GDP is slightly lower at the end of 2021. 
The adjustment for 2019 reflects a surprise surge in exports in the second 
quarter, which resulted largely from temporary factors. In 2020 and 2021, 
weaker foreign demand, additional trade policy uncertainty and the lower 
spending profile in the new Alberta budget weigh on growth. Lower mort-
gage rates and the larger working-age population provide a partial offset. 

Consistent with an economy that, outside the oil-producing regions, 
appears to have been operating close to potential, measures of core infla-
tion have been hovering near 2 percent. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation 
is also expected to remain close to target over the projection horizon.

Box 1

Key inputs to the base-case projection
The Bank’s projection is always conditional on several key 
assumptions, and changes to them aﬀ ect the outlook for 
the Canadian economy . The Bank regularly reviews these 
assumptions and assesses the sensitivity of the economic 
projection to them . The Bank’s current assumptions are as 
follows:
•  Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent average 
levels . The per-barrel prices in US dollars for Brent and 
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) have recently averaged 
close to $60 and $55, respectively . Brent is about $5 
lower than assumed in the July Report, while WTI is 
about the same . The Bank’s projections for production 
and exports of Canadian oil are linked to transportation 
capacity rather than based on an assumption about the 
price of Western Canadian Select .

•  By convention, the Bank does not forecast the exchange 

rate in its base-case projection . The Canadian dollar 
is assumed to remain at 76 cents over the projection 
horizon, close to its recent average and broadly in line 
with the 75 cents assumed in the July Report .

•  The Bank estimates that the output gap was between 
0 and -1 p ercent in the third quarter of 2019, slightly 
smaller than assumed for the second quarter in July .

•  Canadian potential output growth is assumed to 

decrease from 1 .9 percent in 2019 to 1 .7 percent on 
average over 2020–22 . These assumed growth rates are 
close to the midpoints of the Bank’s estimated ranges 
(Table 2) . This proﬁ le is, on average, slightly weaker than 
in the July scenario, mainly refl ecting a weaker business 
investment proﬁ le over the projection horizon that is 
only partly oﬀ set by a larger working-age population . 
Details on the Bank’s assessment of potential output are 
provided in the Appendix to the April Report .

•  The neutral nominal policy rate is deﬁ ned as the real rate 
consistent with output remaining sustainably at its poten-
tial and with infl ation at target, on an ongoing basis, plus 
2 percent for infl ation . It is a medium- to long-term equi-
librium concept . For Canada, the economic projection 
is based on an assumption that the neutral rate is at the 
midpoint of the estimated range of 2 .25 to 3 .25 percent . 
This range was last reassessed in the April Report .

Growth softening in the second half of 2019
The economy grew by 3.7 percent in the second quarter of 2019, after 
two weak quarters. This rebound was driven by a temporary surge in both 
energy and some non-energy exports. In contrast, final domestic demand 
shrank, and the pace of inventory accumulation slowed, both subtracting 
significantly from growth.

The Bank estimates that real GDP will expand by only about 11/4 percent 
in the second half of 2019 (Table 3 and Chart 6). The oil sector continues 
to face transportation challenges and production constraints. Outside this 
sector, weakness in foreign demand, escalating global trade conflicts and 
geopolitical tensions are weighing heavily on business investment and 
exports. Further, the strike of autoworkers in the United States and the 
scheduled end of vehicle production at the General Motors plant in Oshawa, 
Ontario, are suppressing activity in the auto industry.

 Resales

 Fundamental level*

* The estimated fundamental level of resales is determined by full-time employment, housing affordability 

and migration. For more information, see T. Webley, “Fundamental Drivers of Existing Home Sales in 
Canada,” Bank of Canada Staff Discussion Paper No. 2018-16 (December 2018).

Last data plotted: December 2019

In contrast, employment and wage gains have been and are expected 
to remain resilient, supported by robust activity in the service sector. 
Consumer spending is estimated to increase by about 1¾ percent, near its 
average pace over the past four quarters. In addition, housing starts and 
resales are growing strongly as housing recovers from a period of adjust-
ment to policies introduced in 2016–18 (Chart 7).

Housing markets generally reflect regional economic conditions. Housing 
starts and resales have been particularly robust in Quebec and Ontario, 
where labour markets have been strong. These provinces will likely continue 
to be the main drivers of the growth in residential investment. In Alberta, 
where the oil industry is expected to stabilize, modest improvements in 
housing are expected. In British Columbia, residential investment has 
recovered in recent months and should remain near current levels, reflecting 
the creation of new households.

A modest degree of excess capacity
The Bank estimates that the Canadian output gap was between 0 and 
-1 percent in the third quarter (Box 1). Evidence of excess capacity per-
sists in energy-producing regions. Elsewhere, indicators of capacity pres-
sures and labour shortages show few signs of slack. In the autumn Business 
Outlook Survey, firms reported that capacity pressures were mostly labour-
related and that labour markets tightened in most regions (Chart 8).

National measures of labour market conditions continue to be healthy. The 
unemployment rate stands near its historical low, and the participation rate 
of prime-age workers is near its historical high. Job creation remains robust, 
especially in the service sector (Chart 9). Employment gains have been 
strongest for full-time jobs, particularly in mid- and high-paying positions.5 
However, regional differences are evident in the Canadian labour market. 

5  Mid-paying positions are defined as those paying 85 percent up to 115 percent of the median full-time 

wage, and high-paying as 115 percent or more.

For example, in Alberta, conditions have been weak—the unemployment 
rate remains relatively elevated, and job growth is slower than in other 
regions.

In line with national labour market conditions, growth of wages has picked 
up. Overall, the Bank’s composite measure of wages, the wage-common, 
is estimated to have risen further in the third quarter to 3 percent, from 
2.3 percent in the first half of the year. In energy-producing regions, wage 
growth has increased recently and is now in line with the national average 
(Chart 10).

Core and CPI inflation have remained near 2 percent (Chart 11). CPI infla-
tion in the third quarter was 1.9 percent, higher than expected in the July 
Report, largely reflecting higher airfare and prices of vegetables and cell-
phones (Table 3). The Bank estimates that CPI inflation will remain close to 
the 2 percent target in the fourth quarter.

Economic growth to increase to around potential
The Bank anticipates that economic growth will gradually improve in 
2020 and 2021 to around potential (Table 2 and Box 1). Rising incomes 
and the recent decline in mortgage interest rates are expected to support 
growth in consumer spending and housing. Businesses are anticipated 
to adjust to an environment of elevated uncertainty, and oil transportation 
capacity is forecast to increase. With these developments, growth in busi-
ness investment and exports is expected to re-emerge at a moderate pace. 
Nevertheless, investment as a share of GDP should remain low. 

Trade tensions and the related uncertainty are affecting the Canadian 
economy both directly and indirectly. They are adding directly to the drag 
on investment and exports through greater uncertainty and lower business 
confidence in Canada. The indirect impacts are stemming from international 
sources, which affect the Canadian economy primarily through weaker for-
eign demand for Canadian exports and lower commodity prices. The Bank 
estimates that, together, the direct and indirect impacts would remove about 
2 percent from the level of Canadian GDP by the end of 2021 in the absence 
of any policy actions.6 This impact is about 0.4 percentage points larger 
than was estimated in July.

Business investment and exports to grow moderately
Both business investment and exports are expected to resume their expan-
sion in 2020. The projection for business investment and exports reflects 
soft growth in foreign demand and is restrained by trade policy uncertainty 
and competitiveness challenges.

6  These factors started weighing on the Canadian economy in 2017 and have been intensifying since. 

The Bank estimates that they have already pulled down GDP by more than half of the impact estimated 
for 2021. As is the case in the global section, the upside scenario in Box 2 of the July Report can be 
used as an estimate of the total drag on the Canadian economy resulting from trade policy and related 
uncertainty. Differences between what is reported in the current base-case scenario and what is 
implied in the box are due to new trade actions, additional uncertainty and rounding.

In the oil and gas sector, improving transportation capacity, along with the 
easing of production constraints, is expected to support a rebound in pro-
duction.7 Thus, energy exports are expected to pick up in 2020 and 2021 
(Chart 12). Moreover, as business sentiment gradually improves in line with 
the expansion of transportation capacity, investment is anticipated to sta-
bilize in 2020 and expand in 2021. The sector’s share in total business 
investment is anticipated to remain at about half of what it was in 2014, 
before the sharp decline in oil prices (Chart 13).

7  New pipeline capacity will come from several optimization and expansion projects, starting at the end 

of 2019, as well as Enbridge Line 3, expected to be completed by mid-2021. Taken together, these 
developments are expected to increase pipeline capacity by up to 640,000 barrels per day.

Outside the oil and gas sector, the drag on growth of business investment 
from trade policy uncertainty, as well as from delays in the delivery of the 
Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, is expected to dissipate.8 The strength of the ser-
vice sector and the digitalization of the economy will continue to support 
investment. For instance, recent announcements of new direct investments 
suggest that Canada is attracting investments by foreign firms in knowledge-
intensive fields, including software and digital services (e.g., video games, 
smartphone applications, web content and custom computer programming 
services) and related business services. In addition, the LNG Canada pro-
ject will continue to boost spending in the transportation sector.

This gradual improvement is consistent with the responses to the autumn 
Business Outlook Survey. Almost half the firms reported intentions to 
increase investment spending, often in technologies that improve produc-
tivity. Nonetheless, exporters had modest investment intentions, with fewer 
firms than in recent surveys saying foreign demand supports their capital 
spending plans.

The outlook for non-energy exports is mixed across categories. Overall 
growth in non-energy commodity exports is projected to remain subdued, 
despite a rebound in exports of steel and aluminum products following 
the end of the North American tariffs. Among non-commodity categories, 
growth of exports of services and consumer goods excluding automobiles 
should remain strong, while that of machinery and equipment is expected 
to be soft. In addition, motor vehicle production and exports are likely to 
decline further because Canadian motor vehicle assemblers are reducing 
production in response to both mandate changes and softening sales.

After slowing in the second half of 2019, import growth should recover in 
2020 and 2021, in line with the rise in business investment and exports.

A resilient labour market to support household spending
Over the projection horizon, household spending is expected to be sup-
ported by solid growth of disposable income, lower rates for mortgages and 
a larger working-age population. With the lower mortgage rates, households 
renewing their mortgages are no longer facing sizable increases in interest 
payments (Box 2).

However, given their high levels of debt, households are expected to be cau-
tious in their spending decisions. Consumer spending is therefore projected 
to grow at a somewhat slower pace than disposable income. As a result, the 
projection includes a gradual increase in the savings rate from current low 
levels (Chart 14), and the ratio of household debt to disposable income is 
anticipated to edge down. Nonetheless, while household sector vulnerabil-
ities are expected to ease, they should remain elevated over the projection 
horizon.

Housing activity is anticipated to continue to recover toward a level con-
sistent with solid income, low borrowing costs and a growing population. 
This recovery should result in strong growth of residential investment of 
about 5 percent in 2020. Subsequently, housing activity is expected to slow 
to a pace roughly in line with underlying housing demand. In 2021, residen-
tial investment is expected to expand by about 1 percent.

8  Canadian airlines are expected to resume their imports of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft once regulators 

approve the plane for service. Air Canada and WestJet have so far received roughly half and one-
quarter of their total order of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, respectively. The Bank estimates that, had the 
grounding not occurred, investment in machinery and equipment could have been about 3 percent 
higher in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Mortgage rate increases at renewal declined

over 2019
Monthly data

Mortgage renewals in the current interest rate environment
Canadian ﬁ xed mortgage rates have been falling throughout 
2019, in line with global market interest rates . The mortgage 
payments of households recently renewing their mortgages 
are therefore unlikely to have risen by as much as indicated 
in the simulation described in Box 3 of the July 2018 Report .1
Analysis of microdata reveals that the average household 
renewing a mortgage so far in 2019 faced a rate increase 
of about 35 basis points relative to the rate at origination . 
However, these increases have been diminishing throughout 
the year, peaking at 80 basis points in January and falling to 
just 10 basis points in August (Chart 2-A) .
The magnitude of rate increases also varied with the choice 
of mortgage product . For instance, those renewing variable-
rate mortgages faced an average rate increase of about 
65 basis points . This resulted in a noticeable shift away from 
variable- to ﬁ xed-rate mortgages (Chart 2-B) .
In addition to changes in mortgage rates, changes in debt- 
servicing costs at renewal would have depended on (1) the 
extent to which households paid down their mortgages 
faster than they were obligated to, and (2) income growth 
realized between origination and renewal . About 20 percent 
of households made mortgage prepayments, which helped 
oﬀ set the impact of higher interest rates on mortgage pay-
ments .2 In addition, assuming that income between origin-
ation and renewal grew in line with economy-wide income 
per worker, mortgage debt-service ratios of households 
renewing mortgages in 2019 would have fallen by 1 .2 per-
centage points, on average .
If mortgage rates were to remain near current levels, house-
holds renewing mortgages in 2020 and 2021 would not 
face materially higher rates . For illustrative purposes, con-
sider households whose ﬁ ve-year ﬁ xed rates are coming 
up for renewal in 2020 and 2021 and who opt for another 
ﬁ ve-year ﬁ xed rate . These households would face rate 
increases of only about 10 and 25 basis points, respectively . 
Of course, other renewal options are also possible, with 
some shorter -term ﬁ xed rates potentially leading to rate 
decreases .
Overall, mortgage debt-service ratios at renewal are likely 
to continue to decline on average .

2  Calculations are based on the assumption that households do not change their 
eﬀ ective amortization schedule upon renewal . In principle, prepayments can be 
used to lower the amortization period, so the required mortgage payment remains 
unchanged at renewal .

The Bank forecasts CPI inflation will be around the 2 percent target over 
the projection horizon (Table 2). Economic slack is expected to be a source 
of modest downward pressure on inflation that is largely offset by a small 
boost from the federal carbon pollution charge (Chart 15). In 2020, infla-
tion is expected to decrease temporarily due to a renewed drag from energy 
prices.

The base-case projection provides the Bank’s view of the most likely out-
come for inflation, although any projection is subject to considerable 
uncertainty. Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, a 
reasonable range around the projection for CPI inflation is ±0.3 percentage 
points. A complementary perspective is provided using statistical analysis 
of the Bank’s forecast errors, which suggests that a 50 percent confidence 
interval around the base-case projection widens from ±0.2 percentage 
points in the fourth quarter of 2019 to ±0.6 percentage points by the end 
of 2021. Over the same period, a 90 percent confidence band widens from 
±0.6 to ±1.4 percentage points.

The projection is consistent with medium- and long-term inflation expecta-
tions remaining well anchored. Almost all firms responding to the Business 
Outlook Survey anticipate that inflation will remain within the Bank’s target 
range of 1 to 3 percent over the next two years. Most respondents expect 
inflation to be in the bottom half of the target range. The September 
2019 Consensus Economics forecast for CPI inflation is 2.0 percent in 
2019 and 2020. Responses to a quarterly question on long-term inflation 
expectations show an average of 1.9 percent through 2029.

RisKs to thE inFlation outlooK  19 

Risks to the inflation outlook

The outlook for inflation is subject to several upside and downside risks. 
The most important risk to the Canadian economy continues to be around 
global trade policies and related uncertainty. Because the Bank’s base-case 
scenario incorporates the adverse effects of announced tariffs and elevated 
uncertainty, the trade policy risk is two-sided but tilted to the downside.

If current trade disputes were resolved and if increases in tariffs introduced 
over the past two years were reversed, economic activity and inflation would 
be stronger. Alternatively, trade conflicts could escalate further or become 
widespread, which would negatively affect Canadian GDP. The net effect of 
increased trade tensions on Canadian inflation would depend on a number 
of factors. While weaker aggregate demand would reduce inflationary pres-
sures, a weaker Canadian dollar and lower productivity would push up infla-
tion. Moreover, any tariff increases would also have a direct effect on import 
prices.9

Protectionist trade policies work through the supply side by limiting cap-
acity and pushing up prices. The recent experience of a marked slowdown 
in real activity and soft inflation suggests the uncertainty associated with 
trade conflict and unresolved negotiations are also weighing importantly 
on demand. This Report considers an illustrative scenario with greater 
global uncertainty driving additional global weakness than in the base case 
(Box 3). The scenario illustrates the channels through which economic 
activity and inflation in Canada would be affected.

Aside from trade policy, the Bank assesses that the risks to the projected 
path for inflation are roughly balanced. As in past reports, the focus is on 
those risks identified as the most important to the projected path for infla-
tion, drawing from a larger set of risks considered in the projection. Table 4 
summarizes the evolution of some of the key risks since July.

(i)  Sharp tightening of global financial conditions ()

Risk premiums have remained tight even as growth concerns have 
increased. Given the growing evidence that global trade conflicts 
and related uncertainty are taking a toll on economic activity, market 
prices could adjust rapidly. A sharp increase of risk premiums and 
tightening of other financial conditions could also lead to capital out-
flows from stressed EMEs. These developments could translate into 
weaker global and Canadian growth.

9  Box 2 of the July 2019 Report considered two extreme risk scenarios, a positive one and a negative 

one, to illustrate the forces that would come into play.

(ii)  Stronger consumption in Canada ()

The base-case projection incorporates cautious behaviour on the part 
of consumers, with a gradual increase in the savings rate. However, the 
recent strength in wages and employment could boost consumer confi-
dence and lead to stronger consumption over the projection horizon.

(iii)  Stronger residential investment and rising household 

vulnerabilities in Canada ( and )
Recent strong growth in employment and the decrease in mortgage 
rates could spur more demand for housing than in the base-case 
scenario. Stronger housing demand could put additional pressures on 
already elevated house prices, increase borrowing and raise house-
hold vulnerabilities.

(iv)  Weaker growth in emerging-market economies ()

In China, implementing further policy stimulus to offset the negative 
effects of ongoing trade conflicts without causing a pickup in private 
credit growth could be challenging. Additionally, recovery in other 
oil-importing EMEs could be more sluggish than in the base case. In 
particular, the credit crunch in India and ongoing political challenges 
in some EMEs could have larger and more persistent effects. Such 
developments could put downward pressure on commodity prices.

(v)  Global disinflation ()

Inflation has been persistently below target in many countries. In this 
context, import prices may contribute to a softer outlook for Canadian 
inflation than in the base-case projection.

Box 3

Scenario with more pronounced global slowdown
In this alternative scenario, a plausibly higher degree of 
global uncertainty than in the base case gives rise to a 
more pronounced global slowdown .1 The extra uncertainty 
assumed in the scenario is roughly consistent with the 
additional future reductions in the US federal funds rate 
expected by ﬁ nancial markets .2 A combination of model-
ling and judgment was used to capture and quantify the 
key channels through which this higher level of uncertainty 
is likely to aﬀ ect the Canadian economy . Throughout, the 
scenario assumes that monetary and ﬁ scal policies in 

1  The uncertainty in question can take many forms, including geopolitical and trade 
policy uncertainty . However, unlike in Box 2 of the July Report, the scenario does 
not involve the imposition of tariﬀ s above and beyond those already incorporated 
into the base-case projection .

2  Speciﬁ cally, an empirical model was used to estimate the increase in uncertainty 
needed to generate a shift in the path of the federal funds rate roughly equivalent 
to the diﬀ erence between the path implied by futures markets as of October 21, 
2019, and a proﬁ le in line with the Federal Open Market Committee’s most recent 
Summary of Economic Projections, published on September 18, 2019 .

Canada and the rest of the world do not respond to the 
additional weakness in economic outcomes . In this way, 
the scenario isolates the eﬀ ects of greater global uncer-
tainty and more clearly identiﬁ es the extent of the potential 
challenge facing policy-makers .

The global outlook would be considerably weaker
Greater uncertainty would lead to decreased business and 
consumer conﬁ dence globally . Moreover, it would generate 
tighter ﬁ nancial conditions, refl ecting the response of ﬁ nan-
cial markets to greater macroeconomic risk . While ﬁ nancial 
conditions are tighter, the scenario assumes that there 
are no ﬁ nancial crises that would contribute to a further 
worsening of economic outcomes . Deterioration of conﬁ -
dence and ﬁ nancial conditions would result in lower global 
business investment and household spending .

Box 3 (continued)

Global growth would be considerably slower than in the 
base-case projection in both 2020 and 2021 (Chart 3-A) . 
By the end of 2021, the level of global GDP would be 
about 2 1/4 percent lower than in the base-case projection . 
Commodity prices would be approximately 20 to 25 percent 
lower, refl ecting the weaker global demand .

Eﬀ ects on Canada could be signifi cant
The more pronounced global slowdown would be trans-
mitted to Canada through several channels . For example, 
weaker global demand would lower Canada’s terms of trade 
and exports . Income eﬀ ects associated with these shifts 
would put downward pressure on domestic demand . This 
pressure would be reinforced by tighter ﬁ nancial condi-
tions and the weaker business and consumer conﬁ dence 
associated with greater uncertainty . The combination of 
weaker domestic and foreign demand would lead to lower 
trajectories for employment, wages and household income . 
In addition, weaker demand for Canadian goods would 
generate a lower level of inventory investment than in the 
base-case projection, especially given current elevated 
inventory levels . A lower trajectory of household income 
would also contribute to lower house prices . As a result of 
all these changes, household spending, business investment 
and exports would be weaker, and real GDP would be about 
41/2 percent lower by the end of 2021 relative to the base-
case projection . This impact includes an ampliﬁ cation eﬀ ect 
associated with elevated household indebtedness .
Chart 3-A: 
alternative scenario
Percentage change, annual data

Global growth is considerably slower in the 

The Canadian dollar would depreciate by roughly 15 percent 
relative to the base case . This depreciation would play a key 
role in facilitating the adjustment of the Canadian economy 
to the weaker global economic outlook . For instance, a 
weaker Canadian dollar would help contain the adverse 
eﬀ ects on exports and Canadian income . At the same time, 
the depreciation would make foreign goods and services 
more expensive, generating a shift in the composition of 
demand toward domestic goods and services . In addition, 
the lower Canadian dollar would put upward pressure on 
expected infl ation, contributing to lower real interest rates 
for households and ﬁ rms than would otherwise be the case .
The weaker potential output associated with less business 
investment would have negative eﬀ ects on the supply side 
of the economy . These supply eﬀ ects and a lower Canadian 
dollar would partially mitigate the negative impact of 
weaker aggregate demand on infl ation . Overall, CPI infl ation 
would be 0 .7 percentage points lower than in the base case 
in 2021 (Chart 3-B) .

There would be scope for a macroeconomic policy 
response
A global macroeconomic policy response could greatly 
reduce the degree of slowdown . The policy response could 
consist of a combination of monetary, ﬁ scal and, where 
appropriate, structural and macroprudential policy .

Canada’s Inflation-Control Strategy1
Inflation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote 

the economic and financial well-being of Canadians.

pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s 
outlook, including risks to the projection, are published four 
times per year in the Monetary Policy Report.

  Canada’s experience with inflation targeting since 1991 has 

shown that the best way to foster confidence in the value 
of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth, 
employment gains and improved living standards is by keeping 
inflation low, stable and predictable.

Inflation targeting is symmetric and flexible
  Canada’s inflation-targeting approach is symmetric, which 

means that the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising 
above or falling below the 2 per cent target.

  In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 

Canada’s inflation-control target for a further five-year period, 
ending December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the 
consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 per cent midpoint 
of the control range of 1 to 3 per cent.

  Canada’s inflation-targeting framework is flexible. Typically, 

the Bank seeks to return inflation to target over a horizon of six 
to eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for 
returning inflation to target will vary depending on the nature 
and persistence of the shocks buffeting the economy.

The monetary policy instrument
  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes in the 

target for the overnight rate of interest.2 These changes are 
transmitted to the economy through their influence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate, 
which affect total demand for Canadian goods and services. 
The balance between this demand and the economy’s 
production capacity is, over time, the primary determinant of 
inflation pressures in the economy.

  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight 
quarters—to work their way through the economy and have 
their full effect on inflation. For this reason, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent com-
munications, the Bank regularly reports its perspective on 
the forces at work on the economy and their implications for 
inflation. The Monetary Policy Report is a key element of this 
approach. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight 

Monitoring inflation
  In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in 
indirect taxes such as GST, can cause sizable fluctuations in 
CPI.

  In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through 

such transitory movements in CPI inflation and focuses on a 
set of “core” inflation measures that better reflect the under-
lying trend of inflation. In this sense, these measures act as an 
operational guide to help the Bank achieve the CPI inflation 
target. They are not a replacement for CPI inflation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core inflation are CPI-
trim, which excludes CPI components whose rates of change 
in a given month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which 
corresponds to the price change located at the 50th percentile 
(in terms of basket weight) of the distribution of price changes; 
and CPI-common, which uses a statistical procedure to track 
common price changes across categories in the CPI basket.

1  See Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target (October 24, 2016) and Renewal of the 

Inflation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide additional  monetary 

stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website, 
describes these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Global Economy

Global economic growth continues to strengthen and broaden across coun-
tries. The US economy remains robust, while growth has also firmed in other 
advanced economies and in many emerging-market economies (EMEs). The 
global growth profile is modestly above that in the October Monetary Policy 
Report, averaging about 3 1/2 per cent over 2017–19 (Table 1). The outlook 
for advanced economies is stronger than in October: economic growth for 
the United States, in particular, has been revised up, reflecting stronger 
momentum and recent tax reform legislation. Meanwhile, although inflation 
in advanced economies remains below target, it is expected to rise.

The outlook remains subject to considerable uncertainty, mainly around 
geopolitical developments and trade policy. For Canada and Mexico, the 
estimated drag on investment and trade associated with trade-policy 
uncertainty has been increased relative to October, reflecting greater uncer-
tainty around renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA). However, the Bank’s base-case scenario is predicated on existing 
trade arrangements over the projection horizon.

The US economy is projected to grow at a solid pace
The US economy has been expanding at a robust pace. Third-quarter 
growth was higher than expected, mainly reflecting stronger net exports. 
Recent monthly data, such as on household consumption and housing 
starts, also indicate greater momentum. While wage growth remains 
modest, the labour market has continued to improve (Chart 1). The 
unemployment rate has been falling, the prime-age participation rate has 
been rising and recent job gains have been strong—the average number 
of new jobs per month over the past six months is now about 165,000. 
Indicators of business and consumer confidence have also remained 
elevated.

The projection includes recently legislated tax reforms. The Bank assumes 
that reductions in personal and corporate taxes will accumulate to roughly 
US$600 billion by the end of 2019.1 The boost to household disposable 
income from reduced personal taxes is expected to stimulate household 
expenditures. However, this effect will likely be relatively modest since the 
distribution of tax cuts favours high-income individuals who tend to spend a 
smaller share of any tax savings. The reduction in the federal corporate tax 
rate, combined with more generous tax treatment of capital expenditures, 
should prompt additional capital spending by firms. Taken together, these 
tax reforms are expected to boost the level of gross domestic product (GDP) 
by 0.5 per cent in 2019.2

Overall, growth is projected to average about 2 1/2 per cent over the 2017–19 
period, an increase from the October Report based on both greater-
than-expected momentum and the tax reform legislation. The underlying 
dynamics of the economic outlook remain largely unchanged. Consumption 
is expected to expand at a healthy pace, based on robust fundamentals,

including a strong labour market. Business investment should be supported 
by the projected solid pace of expansion of private demand as well as the 
tax changes. Net exports, in contrast, are likely to weigh on growth.

The base-case projection is subject to considerable uncertainty. Importantly, 
growth could be weaker if materially more protectionist trade policies are 
implemented.

Other advanced economies are showing signs of 
increased momentum
Growth in the euro area has been stronger than expected and continues 
to be broad-based across countries in the region. Recent data, notably 
improving labour market indicators and elevated indicators of economic 
sentiment, suggest greater momentum.

In Japan, third-quarter growth was stronger than anticipated. Measures of 
business and economic conditions have been rising, indicating stronger 
growth prospects than previously assessed.

Based on these developments, the growth outlook for the euro area and 
Japan has been revised up. The pace of expansion in both economies is still 
expected to moderate over the projection horizon.

Inflation is expected to edge up in advanced economies
Inflation in advanced economies has shown some upward movement. Core 
inflation has ticked up modestly in some jurisdictions, although it has been 
at low levels in most countries, mainly reflecting past labour market slack 
(Chart 2). Inflation in US core personal consumption expenditures has 
picked up, mostly due to higher prices for services, notably financial and 
telecommunication services.

Wage inflation and price inflation in advanced economies are expected to 
edge up gradually as growth remains above potential and capacity pres-
sures build.3 This rise is also consistent with market expectations for infla-
tion, which appear to have stabilized and, in some cases, started to drift up 
after being on a gradual downward trend through the first half of 2017.

Growth in emerging-market economies has been strong, 
but challenges remain
Economic activity in China is evolving largely as anticipated. Growth is pro-
jected to moderate from about 6 3/4 per cent in 2017 to about 6 1/4 per cent 
in 2019, as the economy rebalances toward a more sustainable and higher-
quality growth path. This profile is consistent with the Chinese administra-
tion’s emphasis on structural reforms, on protecting the environment and on 
addressing financial sector vulnerabilities.

In other oil-importing EMEs, growth is projected to average about 
4 1/4 per cent over 2017–19. Strength is particularly evident in emerging Asia, 
where, in some countries, there has been notable progress on growth-
enhancing reforms. The growth profile has been revised up over 2017–18 
based on recent widespread strength in economic activity in much of emer-
ging Asia and emerging Europe. In contrast, the pickup in growth in the “rest 
of the world” grouping over 2017–19 is projected to be more modest than 
previously expected. The adjustment of EME oil exporters to lower oil prices 
has been more protracted than anticipated, and the related fiscal consolida-
tion is expected to exert a larger drag on growth.

Financial conditions have been accommodative
Global financial conditions remain accommodative amid strengthening 
global growth, progress on US tax reforms and generally low inflation. Yields 
on long-term sovereign bonds have edged up while equity markets have 
been strong, notably in the United States. At the same time, monetary policy 
in some major jurisdictions has been putting upward pressure on short-term 
yields since October. The Federal Reserve has continued to gradually nor-
malize monetary policy, and markets expect several further increases in the 
federal funds rate in 2018 and beyond. The Bank of England also raised its 
policy rate in November. As a result of this combination of rising short-term 
rates and comparatively stable long-term yields, yield curves globally are 
somewhat flatter.

Global oil price benchmarks have risen
Benchmark prices for global crude oil have recently averaged about 
20 per cent higher than assumed in October, driven mainly by supply-side 
factors. Prices have been supported by political tensions in parts of the 
Middle East as well as pipeline outages, particularly in Libya and the North 
Sea. With slowing growth in the productivity of newly drilled shale wells, 
diminished expectations for US shale oil production also likely supported 
prices. In addition, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 
(OPEC) and some other oil producers extended the agreement to maintain 
their lower levels of production in November.

3  This assessment is supported by a staff survey of the literature. See R. St-Cyr, “Non-linéarité de la 
courbe de Phillips : un survol de la littérature,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note (forthcoming).

Meanwhile, the spread between the prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) 
and Western Canada Select (WCS) has widened sharply. Transportation 
constraints faced by Canadian producers have held down the price of WCS, 
leaving it just below October levels, while the price of WTI has continued to 
climb.

By convention, the Bank assumes that oil prices will remain near their recent 
levels (Box 1, page 8). Prices around these levels appear consistent with 
continued demand-supply adjustment in the global oil market. Risks to 
global oil prices are tilted to the downside over 2018: US oil production has 
been increasing steadily, and a recent uptick in drilling activity for US shale 
oil suggests that production could be even stronger (Chart 3). Meanwhile, if 
transportation issues are resolved, the price of WCS could move closer to 
that of WTI.

The Bank’s non-energy commodity price index is broadly unchanged rela-
tive to that in October. Despite recent volatility, base metal prices are back 
near October levels, with one exception in the sharp rise in iron ore spot 
prices. Lumber prices have risen modestly, supported by strong demand 
associated with higher single-family housing starts in the United States. 
Agriculture prices are little changed.

Canadian Economy

The Canadian economy grew strongly in 2017, and the level of economic 
activity is now close to capacity. Growth is expected to average about 
2.5 per cent in the near term and then slow to close to potential growth. 

Economic activity is being supported by still-accommodative monetary 
policy and financial conditions, as well as public infrastructure spending. 
The contribution to growth from household spending is projected to de-
cline, as recently robust employment gains and growth in household income 
are expected to slow. Meanwhile, the combined contribution to growth from 
exports and business investment is expected to rise with foreign demand. 
With these anticipated shifts in the composition of demand, the economy is 
expected to progress on a more sustainable basis.

The fundamentals supporting the profile for GDP growth have solidified 
since October. Prospects for exports have improved in light of the stronger 
US outlook and higher commodity prices. Further, a reassessment showing 
that domestic housing fundamentals are stronger has raised the profile for 
residential investment. However, the uncertainty associated with the NAFTA 
renegotiations has increased, weighing further on the outlook for investment 
and exports.

The economy is estimated to have grown by 3.0 per cent in 2017. Strong 
growth brought output close to potential and was accompanied by a sig-
nificant reduction in labour market slack. Growth is expected to slow to 
2.2 per cent in 2018 and to 1.6 per cent in 2019 (Table 2 and Box 1).

CPI inflation picked up to 2.1 per cent in November, reflecting greater in-
creases in the prices for gasoline and automobiles. Inflation is anticipated to 
fluctuate in the near term as various positive and negative temporary factors—
namely those related to gasoline, electricity and food prices—dissipate over 
different time frames.

Inflation is expected to remain close to 2 per cent over the projection 
horizon.

Box 1

Key inputs to the base-case projection
The Bank’s projection is always conditional on several key 
assumptions, and changes to them will aﬀ ect the outlook 
for the global and Canadian economies . The Bank regularly 
reviews these assumptions and assesses the sensitivity 
of the economic projection to them . The Bank’s current 
assumptions are as follows:
•  Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent average 

levels . The per-barrel prices in US dollars for Brent, West 
Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western Canada Select 
(WCS) are about $65, $60 and $35, respectively . Brent 
and WTI are about $10 higher than assumed in the 
October Report, while WCS is lower by about $5 .

•  By convention, the Bank does not attempt to forecast 

the exchange rate in the base-case projection . Over the 
projection horizon, the Canadian dollar is assumed to 
remain close to its recent average of 79 cents, compared 
with the 81 cents assumed in October and 76 cents in 
July . 

•  The Bank estimates that the output gap was in a range 
of -0 .25 to +0 .75 per cent in the fourth quarter . For the 
projection, the output gap was assumed to be at the 
midpoint of this range . This compares with the October 
assumption that the output gap was in a range of -0 .5 to 
+0 .5 per cent in the third quarter of 2017 .

•  The level of business investment was revised up by 

about 2 .5 per cent starting in 2014, implying a higher 

capital stock and an upward revision to the level of 
potential . As a result, the level of potential in the third 
quarter of 2017 has been adjusted up by 0 .2 per cent . 
Since the level of gross domestic product was also 
revised up by 0 .2 per cent, the estimate of the output 
gap in that quarter was unaﬀ ected by the revisions . A 
signiﬁ cant portion of the revisions to investment are 
maintained over the projection, so the capital stock is 
expected to  build up faster than previously assumed . 
The annual growth of potential output is therefore 
now assumed to average 1 .6 per cent over the 2018–19 
projection horizon, 0 .1 percentage point higher than in 
the October scenario (Table 2) .1 Further details on the 
Bank’s assessment of potential output are provided 
in the appendix to the April 2017 Report, and a full 
reassessment will be presented in April 2018 .

•  The neutral nominal policy rate is deﬁ ned as the real rate 
consistent with output at its potential level and infl ation 
equal to target after the eﬀ ects of all cyclical shocks 
have dissipated, plus 2 per cent for the infl ation target . 
For Canada, the neutral rate is estimated to be between 
2 .5 and 3 .5 per cent . The economic projection is based 
on the midpoint of this range, which has remained 
unchanged since April 2017 .

The evolution of potential is a key issue
With the Canadian economy close to capacity, the Bank is evaluating 
whether strong demand is motivating firms to increase investment, entre-
preneurs to create new firms, and people to enter the labour force or to in-
crease their working hours. All these developments would contribute to 
stronger growth in potential. In addition, the Bank is closely monitoring the 
dynamics of wages and inflation, including the implications of globalization 
and technology, to assess the interactions between capacity and inflation-
ary pressures in the economy.

Revisions to historical data since October suggest that the level of busi-
ness investment has been much higher since the start of 2014 than previ-
ously estimated. This stronger profile implies a larger capital stock and more 
production capacity. As a result, the estimated level of potential in the third 
quarter of 2017 was revised up by 0.2 per cent relative to the October Report.

Business investment growth resumed in 2017
Business investment increased production capacity in 2017. This has been 
enhanced by public infrastructure spending. In the first half of the year, busi-
ness investment growth experienced a robust, broad-based rebound. It 
remained solid in the third quarter, with another strong contribution from in-
vestment in machinery and equipment. Further, the rate at which new firms 
are being created edged up in the third quarter, led by the goods-producing 
sector.

Increasing utilization should encourage ongoing solid investment growth, 
which would result in an expansion of capacity. Data for the third quarter of 
2017 show that capacity utilization rates were rising across most industries. 
In addition, responses to the latest Business Outlook Survey (BOS) indi-
cate that capacity pressures picked up further in the fourth quarter and that 
excess capacity is now largely limited to oil- and gas-producing regions. 
A jump in investment-related imports of machinery and equipment in the 
fourth quarter of 2017 and higher investment intentions in the BOS point to 
continuing strong investment.

Labour market slack has been absorbed more quickly than expected
Capacity pressures have also led firms to ramp up their hiring. The national 
unemployment rate has fallen to a historically low level as a result of strong 
employment gains across industries and regions. The average number of 
hours worked now appears to have recovered from its low in early 2017. The 
Business Outlook Survey reports that labour shortages are more apparent 
and more intense than they were a year ago.

While wage growth has improved, underlying wage pressures remain 
modest (Chart 4).4 The rapid pace of hiring and swift decline in the un-
employment rate in the past few months indicate that labour market slack 
is being absorbed more quickly than expected. However, several other fac-
tors are expected to constrain wage gains despite recent increases in min-
imum wages. The elevated long-term unemployment rate and relatively low 

4  A newly developed measure reflecting the common trend across four data sources shows that under-
lying wage pressures were at 2.2 per cent in the third quarter of 2017, implying that real wage growth 
is relatively low compared with the growth of trend labour productivity. Using the latest Labour Force 
Survey data, the preliminary estimate of underlying wage pressures in the fourth quarter remains at 
2.2 per cent. See D. Brouillette, J. Lachaine and B. Vincent, “Wages: Measurement and Key Drivers,”

over and above the natural expansion of the labour force.5 The Bank’s com-
posite indicator of the labour market, which is designed to capture broad 
labour market developments, has fallen by less than the unemployment rate 
(Chart 5). In addition, global competition, which is likely leading to more out-
sourcing and automation, might also be weighing on wage growth.

Last observation: November 2017

Core inflation measures have generally continued to move up since mid-
2017 and ranged from 1.5 to 1.9 per cent in November (Chart 6). This grad-
ual upward movement is consistent with declining economic slack and 
slowly building inflationary pressures.

Growth in GDP is expected to return to potential
After a strong performance in the first half of the year, economic growth 
moderated in the third quarter of 2017, as expected (Table 3). Consumption 
growth remained strong, and business investment grew at a solid, albeit 
slower, pace. Exports declined sharply, however. In the fourth quarter, GDP 
growth is estimated to have been stronger than potential, raising the esti-
mated range of the output gap to -0.25 to +0.75 per cent.

The economy is expected to grow above potential, at an average of 
2.5 per cent over the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 
(Chart 7). Subsequently, quarterly growth is expected to moderate and 
average close to potential. With this growth trajectory and the economy 
operating near capacity in the fourth quarter of 2017, the level of output is 
expected to track close to that of potential over the projection horizon.

Financial conditions remain accommodative
Financial conditions overall have been broadly stable. Even with recent in-
terest rate increases, the stance of monetary policy in Canada remains ac-
commodative and continues to support the level of economic activity. Policy 
rate increases in July and September of 2017 contributed to higher short-
term rates. The rising short-term rates combined with comparatively stable 
long-term yields have resulted in a flatter Canadian yield curve, in line with 
developments in global markets. Despite this flattening, the yield curve con-
tinues to have a moderate positive slope. The Business Outlook Survey 
and Senior Loan Officer Survey report that, apart from higher prime rates, 
business-lending conditions either remained largely unchanged or eased 
slightly.

Growth of household spending is expected to slow
Consumption is expected to contribute meaningfully to growth in the near 
term, supported by ongoing strong job creation and elevated consumer 
confidence. However, in 2018–19, consumption growth is anticipated to 
moderate and the savings rate to increase in response to slower growth of 
household disposable income and higher interest rates. With higher interest 
rates, debt-service costs are expected to increase, thus dampening con-
sumption growth, particularly of durable goods, which have been a signifi-
cant driver of spending in recent quarters.6

Elevated levels of household debt are likely to amplify the impact of higher 
interest rates on consumption, since increased debt-service costs are more 
likely to constrain some borrowers, forcing them to moderate their expendi-
tures. An increased sensitivity of consumption to interest rates has been in-
corporated in the Bank’s projection model since October, but it is still too 

6  Motor vehicle purchases, communications services, other transportation and furniture are some of the 

consumption categories that Bank staff have identified as most sensitive to changes in interest rates.

early to determine whether this behaviour is showing up in the data on con-
sumer spending.7 If this greater sensitivity fails to materialize, consumption 
could be stronger than anticipated.

Growth of household credit has slowed somewhat since the first half of 2017, 
even though some households may have pulled forward borrowing in antici-
pation of the new B-20 guidelines related to mortgage underwriting from the 
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. This slowing is consist-
ent with higher borrowing costs due to the two policy rate increases in 2017.

The contribution of housing activity to growth is expected to turn positive 
in the fourth quarter of 2017, mainly as a result of a rebound in resale activ-
ity in Toronto (Chart 8). Some of the strength in Toronto resales at the end 
of 2017 may reflect a desire to book transactions in advance of the effect-
ive date of the B-20 guidelines. Residential investment is now expected to 
be roughly flat over the projection horizon. The rate of new household for-
mation is anticipated to support a solid level of housing activity, particularly 
in the Greater Toronto Area, where the supply of new housing units has not 
kept pace with demand. However, interest rate increases, as well as macro-
prudential and other housing policy measures, are expected to weigh on 
growth in residential investment, since some prospective homebuyers may 
take on smaller mortgages or delay purchases.

Business investment is expected to expand at a moderate 
pace
Business investment is expected to continue to provide a moderate contri-
bution to growth over the projection horizon, taking into account the mixed 
effects of recent developments. Strength in spending on machinery and 

7  Work done at that time suggested that the effect on consumption might be as much as 50 per cent more 
in the two years following a persistent change in interest rates when the ratio of collateralized household 
debt to disposable income is 140 per cent, close to its recent high, than when the ratio is 90 per cent, 
roughly its historical average.

equipment is anticipated to continue in the near term before moderating 
somewhat, while the recovery of investment in non-residential structures is 
gradually gaining momentum (Chart 9). Underlying fundamentals are strong 
and would support a more robust growth trajectory were it not for the ef-
fects of heightened uncertainty around trade policy and increased incen-
tives to shift investment from Canada to the United States as a result of US 
tax reforms.

Elevated uncertainty around US trade policy is expected to continue to re-
strain growth in business investment. Although their investment inten-
tions indicate plans to boost spending, respondents to the Business Outlook 
Survey are increasingly concerned about the ongoing NAFTA renegotia-
tions and rising protectionism more generally. Greenfield foreign direct invest-
ment into Canada has declined since mid-2016, especially from Europe but 
also from the United States, a possible sign of the effects of the uncertainty 
around trade policy. Trade-policy uncertainty is expected to reduce the level 
of investment by about 2 per cent by the end of 2019, an additional drag of 
0.5 percentage points compared with the October projection.

The US tax reforms are anticipated to reinforce these uncertainty effects and 
dampen investment growth further. Firms may decide to redirect some of their 
planned investment spending from Canada to the United States to benefit from 
the lower corporate taxes. The negative effects of US tax reforms on Canadian 
investment have been introduced in this projection and are expected to subtract 
0.5 per cent from the level of investment by the end of 2019.

The projected expansion in overall business investment is taking place de-
spite a pullback in the energy sector associated with the recent completion 
of several large oil sands and offshore projects. Oil and gas investment is 
expected to be roughly flat over 2018 and 2019. The profile has been revised 
down relative to the October Report based on new information from consul-
tations with firms in the energy sector and the recent softening in oil and gas 
drilling activity. Despite the rise in global oil prices, firms remain cautious

about new investment projects, reflecting relatively weaker prices for WCS 
and Canadian natural gas, as well as uncertainty around pipeline capacity 
and the impact of other policy changes.

Despite the uncertainty around US trade policy, the projection for invest-
ment outside the energy sector has been revised up based on stronger ex-
pected demand. Healthy fundamentals, including rising capacity pressures, 
widespread positive business sentiment (Chart 10) and an increasing need 
to improve competitiveness through digital technologies, are expected to 
support investment.

Export growth is anticipated to rise over the projection 
horizon
Export growth has resumed and exports are expected to grow broadly in 
line with foreign demand. The upward progression of exports was inter-
rupted by a sharp decline in the third quarter of 2017, owing mainly to an 
anticipated adjustment in automobile production and the reversal of spe-
cial factors that boosted growth earlier in the year. Export growth resumed 
in the fourth quarter: non-commodity goods exports turned positive, driven 
by a rebound in exports of consumer goods and machinery and equipment. 
Nevertheless, exports in 2017 are weaker than in the October Report.

Over the projection, exports of services and commodities are expected to 
remain solid. Non-commodity goods exports outside the auto sector are ex-
pected to grow roughly in line with foreign demand. However, past adjust-
ments to vehicle production mandates will continue to exert a dampening 
effect on exports in the auto sector in 2018.

Positive revisions to economic growth in the United States, mainly in re-
sponse to the effects of the tax reform legislation, are expected to boost 
the level of exports by about 1 per cent by the end of the projection horizon.

Yet, Canada’s ability to benefit from an improving global outlook continues 
to be hindered by uncertainty around the status of trade arrangements. This 
uncertainty is weighing negatively on investment in Canada and the rest of 
the world, and thus on the export outlook. The spillover effects of trade-
policy uncertainty are estimated to be holding back exports by 0.7 per cent 
by the end of 2019, 0.3 percentage points more than had been anticipated in 
October.

CPI inflation is expected to remain close to 2 per cent over 
the projection horizon
CPI inflation is estimated to have averaged 1.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 
2017. Temporary factors, such as past electricity rebates, below-average food 
price inflation and exchange rate pass-through, have contributed to keep in-
flation below target in recent quarters.

Inflation is anticipated to continue to be close to 2 per cent (Chart 11). The 
effects of various temporary factors are expected to dissipate over different 
time frames. In particular, inflation will likely ease in January 2018, reflect-
ing the transitory effects of elevated gasoline prices a year earlier. Inflation 
is then expected to rise as the temporary effects of past fluctuations in con-
sumer energy and food prices fade. The drag from weak food inflation is ex-
pected to dissipate by the fourth quarter of 2018, three quarters later than 
previously expected, as recent developments and consultations suggest a 
more persistent effect from heightened competition among food retailers.

Compared with the October Report, higher prices for crude oil are expected 
to lift the inflation profile in 2018, but other sources of inflationary pressures 
remain broadly similar. The projection for inflation also incorporates the es-
timated effects of recent and scheduled increases in provincial minimum 
wages.8

This projection is consistent with medium- and long-term inflation expecta-
tions remaining well anchored. The December 2017 Consensus Economics 
forecast for CPI inflation is 1.9 per cent in 2018. Responses to a quarterly 
question on long-term inflation expectations show an average of 2.0 per cent 
through 2027.

8  Minimum wage increases are expected to temporarily raise inflation by 0.1 percentage point in 2018.

Canadian Economy,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2017-26 (December 2017).

RisKs to thE inFlation outlooK  19 

Risks to the inflation outlook

The prospect of a notable shift toward protectionist global trade policies 
remains the most important risk surrounding the outlook. While the Bank’s 
base-case scenario incorporates the adverse effects of related elevated 
uncertainty on firms’ investment and export activities, it is otherwise predi-
cated on existing trade arrangements over the projection horizon.

The Bank is continuing to monitor NAFTA renegotiations. The Bank’s calcu-
lations suggest that about 50 per cent of US imports of goods from Canada 
received NAFTA preferential tariff rates in 2016, with significant variation 
across industries.9 As well, NAFTA covers most services. At this stage, it 
is difficult to predict the possible outcomes of trade negotiations and the 
timing, incidence and magnitude of their effects.10

Assuming existing trade arrangements continue, the Bank assesses that the 
risks to the projected path for inflation are roughly balanced. The evolution 
of risks since October is summarized in Table 4. While the risks highlighted 
below are similar to those in the October Report, several risks were partially 
realized and the Bank’s current base-case projection was adjusted accord-
ingly. As in past reports, the focus is on the most important risks for the 
inflation projection.

(i)  Weaker Canadian exports

The Bank’s base-case projection has been adjusted to incorporate 
negative spillover effects of greater uncertainty associated with 
NAFTA renegotiations. Nevertheless, even with a cautious projec-
tion for exports, non-energy goods exports could disappoint, given 
ongoing competitiveness challenges. As well, firms may respond 
to the expansion in foreign demand by investing outside of Canada 
rather than investing in and exporting from Canada.

(ii)  Faster growth in potential output in Canada

While the base-case projection already includes some of the impact 
of strong demand on potential, labour productivity could be stronger 
than anticipated and could lead to faster growth of the economy’s 
potential.11 Thus, inflation could be weaker than projected.

9  For example, in 2016 nearly 90 per cent of US transportation goods imports from Canada received 

NAFTA preferential tariff rates, compared with about 30 per cent of non-agricultural commodity 
imports.

10  The various channels through which prospective changes to trade agreements may affect the economy 

are described in Box 1 of the April 2017 Monetary Policy Report.

11  For more details, see J. Yang, B. Tomlin and O. Gervais, “Alternative Scenario to the October 2017 MPR 

Base-Case Projection: Higher Potential Growth,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2017-18

(iii)  Stronger real GDP growth in the United States

The outlook for US economic growth has been revised up to reflect 
stronger momentum and the direct implications of the recently legis-
lated US tax reforms. However, growth could be even stronger if tax 
reform and deregulation were to trigger “animal spirits” in an environ-
ment of accommodative financial conditions, elevated equity prices 
and high corporate profits. The resulting boost to investment, as well 
as stronger household spending, would have positive spillovers for 
Canadian investment and exports.

(iv)  Stronger consumption and rising household debt in Canada

The outlook for consumption in 2018 has been revised up in the 
base-case projection, because recent data have suggested stronger 
underlying momentum. It still remains the case that persistently ele-
vated consumer confidence could lead to even stronger consumer 
spending, with a savings rate that remains close to or falls below its 
recent relatively low level rather than gradually rising. The vulnerabil-
ities associated with household indebtedness would be exacerbated if 
the additional spending were financed by additional borrowing.

(v)  A pronounced decline in house prices in overheated markets
Imbalances in the Canadian housing market remain, particularly in the 
greater Toronto and Vancouver areas.12 A drop in house prices would 
likely dampen residential investment and consumption in these areas. 
Based on historical experience, direct spillovers to the rest of the 
country would be modest.

Canada’s Inflation-Control Strategy1

Inflation targeting and the economy
•  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to pro-
mote the economic and financial well-being of Canadians. 

•  Canada’s experience with inflation targeting since 1991 
has shown that the best way to foster confidence in the 
value of money and to contribute to sustained economic 
growth, employment gains and improved living standards 
is by keeping inflation low, stable and predictable. 
In 2011, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 
Canada’s inflation-control target for a further five-year 
period, ending 31 December 2016. The target, as measured 
by the total consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 
2 per cent midpoint of the control range of 1 to 3 per cent.

• 

The monetary policy instrument
•  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes 
in the target overnight rate of interest.2 These changes 
are transmitted to the economy through their influence 
on market interest rates, domestic asset prices and the 
exchange rate, which affect total demand for Canadian 
goods and services. The balance between this demand 
and the economy’s production capacity is, over time, the 
primary determinant of inflation pressures in the economy. 

•  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to 
eight quarters—to work their way through the economy 
and have their full effect on inflation. For this reason, 
monetary policy must be forward-looking. 

•  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent 

communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspec-
tive on the forces at work on the economy and their 

implications for inflation. The Monetary Policy Report is a 
key element of this approach. Policy decisions are typi-
cally announced on eight pre-set days during the year, 
and full updates of the Bank’s outlook, including risks to 
the projection, are published four times per year in the 
Monetary Policy Report.

Inflation targeting is symmetric and flexible
•  Canada’s inflation-targeting approach is symmetric, which 
means that the Bank is equally concerned about inflation 
rising above or falling below the 2 per cent target. 
•  Canada’s inflation-targeting framework is flexible. 

Typically, the Bank seeks to return inflation to target over 
a horizon of six to eight quarters. However, the most 
appropriate horizon for returning inflation to target will 
vary depending on the nature and persistence of the 
shocks buffeting the economy.

Monitoring inflation
• 

In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is 
caused by fluctuations in the prices of certain volatile 
components (e.g., fruit and gasoline) and by changes in 
indirect taxes. For this reason, the Bank also monitors a 
set of “core” inflation measures, most importantly the 
CPIX, which strips out eight of the most volatile CPI com-
ponents and the effect of indirect taxes on the remaining 
components. These “core” measures allow the Bank to 
“look through” temporary price movements and focus on 
the underlying trend of inflation. In this sense, core infla-
tion is monitored as an operational guide to help the Bank 
achieve the total CPI inflation target. It is not a replace-
ment for it.

1  See Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target (8 November 2011) and 

Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target: Background Information—November 2011, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide 

 additional monetary stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates,  available 
on the Bank’s website, describes these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Global Economy

Diverging economic prospects and shifting terms of trade continue to be 
dominant themes in the global economic outlook. The U.S. Federal Reserve 
has started the process of gradually withdrawing exceptional monetary 
stimulus, reflecting further improvement in labour market conditions and its 
judgment that inflation will rise to its 2 per cent objective over the medium 
term. In contrast, other major central banks have maintained or expanded 
monetary stimulus in response to persistent economic slack and subdued 
inflation. China is continuing its transition to more sustainable growth. Prices 
of both energy and non-energy commodities have declined further, to their 
lowest levels in over a decade (Chart 1). Lower oil prices are driving major 
adjustments across the world economy and, over time, should provide a net 
boost to global economic activity. Meanwhile, exchange rates are helping to 
redistribute global demand.

Against this background, the global economy is expected to resume 
a strengthening trend over the next two years (Table 1 and Chart 2), 
supported by ongoing monetary policy stimulus and low oil prices. 
Contractionary pressures in certain emerging-market economies (EMEs) 
are also expected to ease. Nonetheless, persistent weakness in global busi-
ness investment and slow progress in implementing structural reforms in a 
number of economies continue to limit the growth of potential output. The 
outlook for global growth is broadly in line with the projection in the October 
Monetary Policy Report, although the composition of U.S. GDP growth is 
expected to be somewhat less favourable for Canadian exports in 2016.

U.S. activity is expected to grow at a healthy pace
The U.S. economy appears to have expanded at a healthy pace in 
2015. Recent data indicate a softening for the fourth quarter that is 
not expected to persist, given strong underlying fundamentals. Labour 
income has benefited from robust employment gains, which averaged 
221,000 per month over 2015. Consumer confidence has hovered near 
post-recession highs. Responses to business surveys suggest that a 
growing number of firms plan to raise wages over the next three months 
(Chart 3). Improving labour income and lower gasoline prices have sup-
ported private domestic demand, as reflected in near-record-high vehicle 
sales, robust residential construction and strong business investment 
outside the commodity-related sectors (Chart 4). The softness in the

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLICy REPORT  •  JANUARy 2016

fourth quarter of 2015 reflects, in part, the effects of temporary factors 
(e.g., a sharp weather-related decline in utilities consumption, new mort-
gage regulations) as well as slower growth in some areas of the economy 
that had been strong in the first three quarters of the year.

The Bank expects the U.S. economy to grow at close to 2 1/2 per cent over 
2016 and 2017, with private domestic demand buttressed by the improving 
labour market, low gasoline prices and still-low interest rates. The head-
winds from the global economy are expected to diminish over the projection 
horizon. While lower oil prices are providing some boost to consumption, 
recent data suggest that consumers are saving more of their income gains 
than expected. Lower commodity prices are also expected to lead to even 
weaker U.S. investment in the oil and mining sectors during 2016, a factor 
that is significant for Canadian exports.

Accommodative monetary policy, low oil prices and past exchange rate 
depreciations are expected to underpin continued expansions in the euro 
area and Japan. The European Central Bank announced further monetary 
easing in December, while the Bank of Japan made adjustments to improve 
the effectiveness of its existing quantitative easing program. Nevertheless, 
growth in these economies is anticipated to remain relatively modest, 
restrained by weak investment and structural factors.

China is transitioning to more sustainable growth
China’s economy continues its shift toward a more sustainable pace and 
composition of economic growth, with greater reliance on market forces. 
While this shift is expected to be successful, the process will be protracted 
and may involve some volatility. Chinese equities saw large declines at 
the beginning of 2016, reflecting the market’s reaction to a combination of 
technical factors and economic information. These declines are expected 
to have little direct impact on Chinese GDP growth, since equities make 
up a small proportion of household assets and play only a limited role in 
corporate finance in China. However, uncertainties around how smoothly 
the transition to a more sustainable growth path will take place could affect 
financial market volatility and capital flows.

GDP growth in China is expected to slow gradually, from just below 7 per cent 
in 2015 to a little over 6 per cent in 2017. As the process of rebalancing 
from manufacturing toward the service sector proceeds, indicators of 
heavy manufacturing and investment—such as industrial production—will 
decelerate, while services and consumption indicators should remain 
solid. Growth in infrastructure investment is expected to slow but to remain 
robust through 2017, in line with the Chinese government’s stated priority to 
address ongoing infrastructure needs. This should continue to help support 
demand for commodities.

Growth in other oil-importing EMEs slowed in 2015, reflecting the effects of 
lower prices for non-energy commodities, spillovers from China’s slowdown 
and tighter financial conditions. Brazil, in particular, has been suffering a 
deep recession that is now expected to be more prolonged than first antici-
pated. Growth in the oil-importing EMEs is projected to pick up as lower oil 
prices support demand, progress is made on structural reforms and dis-
tressed economies gradually improve. Emerging Asia is expected to remain 
the key contributor to growth. Notably, GDP growth in India will likely remain 
in the 7 to 8 per cent range through 2017, supported by some progress on 
policy reforms and lower commodity prices.

In the rest of the world, economic growth in oil-exporting countries is also 
expected to recover over 2016 and 2017, following the sharp oil-related 
slowdown in 2015. However, lower oil prices relative to those at the time of 
the October Report have led to a downward revision to the outlook for GDP 
growth in the rest of the world in 2016.

Oil prices have continued to fall…
Some of the downside risks to oil prices identified in recent Monetary Policy 
Reports have materialized. The global price of crude oil has fallen by more 
than US$20 since the October Report, leaving prices about 75 per cent 
below their peak in June 2014.

The global oil market is expected to gradually rebalance as growth in world 
demand continues and growth in supply slows. However, the adjustment is 
likely to take longer than previously anticipated. Growth in the demand for 
oil picked up over 2015, but the degree of excess supply has become pro-
gressively larger since the second half of 2014. Many producers of low-cost 
conventional oil responded to the initial decline in oil prices by ramping up 
production, partly to compensate for the loss of oil revenues. In this context, 
the lack of agreement on a production quota by the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at its December meeting triggered 
further price declines, and it now looks less likely that additional Iranian oil 
supply will be offset by reductions from other OPEC members. The global 
oil market is now expected to remain in excess supply into 2017.

By convention, the Bank assumes that oil prices will remain near their recent 
levels. The per barrel prices for Brent, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and 
Western Canada Select (WCS) in U.S. dollars have averaged $37, $36 and 
$22, respectively, since early December.

Over the near term, the risks to the Bank’s assumption for oil prices are still 
tilted to the downside. Inventories could increase from already-elevated 
levels, given forecasts of a warm winter in North America and Europe, 
planned refinery outages and the potential for Iranian oil to return to the 
market more quickly than expected. Geopolitical risks to oil prices over the 
near term are two-sided: the recent increase in geopolitical tensions in the 
Middle East could put upward pressure on prices, given the potential for 
supply disruptions, but it could also exert downward pressure if it prompts 
increased competition for market share among OPEC members.

In contrast, over the medium term, the risks to oil prices are tilted to the 
upside. The significant reductions in oil investment since late 2014 could 
leave future demand increases unmet, putting upward pressure on prices 
and drawing investment back into the sector. The level of prices that 
would balance the oil market in the medium term is still highly uncertain, 
particularly since technical improvements and other efficiency gains by 
oil-producing firms have lowered their costs of production. Shifting industry 
expectations of the future level of oil prices, in turn, have an important 
influence on supply dynamics. Prices are likely to remain volatile while this 
protracted process unfolds.

…and non-energy commodity prices are also weaker
The Bank’s non-energy commodity price index has also fallen below the 
level assumed in October, led by declines in the prices of base metals and 
agricultural products.

Excess supply persists in the global market for many base metals. Faced 
with falling prices, many large international mining companies, especially 
those producing iron ore and copper, have focused on cutting costs rather 
than curtailing production. These companies have also benefited from 
lower oil prices—a key input into the production process. Meanwhile, slower 
growth in Chinese heavy manufacturing and investment (activities that gen-
erate strong demand for base metals) and uncertainty about future demand 
have weighed on prices. Agricultural prices have also declined, owing to 
strong supply, while forestry prices are little changed.

The Bank’s non-energy commodity price index is expected to remain near 
its recent levels over the projection horizon. The current excess supply of 
base metals suggests that prices may continue to fall modestly until produc-
tion is cut substantially or growth in demand picks up. This decline will likely 
be offset by stronger prices for lumber, driven by further improvements in 
the U.S. housing market.

The world economy is adjusting to lower commodity 
prices
The effects of the oil price shock on global economic growth continue to 
unfold. The negative impact on oil investment in the United States and oil-
exporting economies is materializing more quickly than the positive impact 
from higher real incomes. The positive effects on global GDP are expected 
to become dominant over 2016 and 2017 and to continue beyond 2017.

Income gains from lower gasoline prices are being used either to boost 
current spending or to repay debt or increase savings, thus improving 
consumers’ ability to spend in future years. Businesses are benefiting from 
a reduction in their production costs, and oil producers are contributing to 
productivity growth by making efforts to improve their competitiveness in a 
low price environment. While some of the global benefits of lower oil prices 
may not have translated into higher expenditures, they have nevertheless 
contributed to improving private and public balance sheets in some oil-
importing countries, which could support future spending. In the euro area, 
this is facilitating ongoing deleveraging. In a number of emerging markets, 
including China and India, some fuel prices are regulated, which means the 
economic benefits of lower prices arise in part through improved govern-
ment finances.

The differing effects of lower commodity prices on commodity exporters 
and importers, as well as shifting growth prospects across regions, are 
contributing to exchange rate movements. Terms of trade have fallen 
significantly among some commodity exporters (e.g., Australia, Canada, 
Mexico and Russia) as commodity prices have declined. In addition, lower 
commodity prices and the negative implications for domestic demand in 
oil-exporting economies have been reflected in substantial depreciations in 
their real effective exchange rates (Chart 5).

Among commodity importers, exchange rate movements have been more 
differentiated. Lower commodity prices are providing support for growth in 
all of these economies. Nevertheless, in the euro area, Japan and Sweden, 
subdued economic recoveries and low inflation have led central banks 
to provide additional monetary policy easing since mid-2014. As a result, 
the currencies of these economies have depreciated notably despite the 
improvements they have experienced in their terms of trade. Meanwhile, the 
U.S. dollar has appreciated.

Exchange rate movements are facilitating a realignment of global activity. 
In general, real net exports as a share of real GDP have increased for com-
modity exporters whose real effective exchange rates have depreciated, 
while they have contracted for commodity importers whose currencies have 
appreciated. The rise in the U.S. dollar has been a drag on GDP growth in 
the United States through rising imports and slower exports, but it is helping 
to reallocate some of the growth in U.S. demand to other regions.

Financial markets are reacting to economic divergence
Since the October Report, falling commodity prices have led to tighter credit 
conditions for commodity producers—evident in particular in widening 
spreads in the high-yield sector, which has a heavy concentration of oil 
and gas producers (Chart 6). More recently, there have been sharp moves 
in a range of global asset prices, particularly global equity and commod-
ities markets, reflecting, at least in part, recent volatility in Chinese capital 
markets.

The long-awaited start of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s gradual process of 
withdrawing policy stimulus was widely anticipated by markets and therefore 
had a limited immediate impact on market prices. While bond yields have 
fallen globally since early 2016, U.S. short-term bond yields remain above 
levels in the October Report. This is in contrast to yields in other advanced 
economies and reflects the diverging policy stances of central banks 
(Chart 7). To forestall inflationary pressures from weaker exchange rates, 
central banks in several emerging markets responded to the Fed’s rate 
increase by raising their policy rates. Spreads on U.S.-dollar-denominated 
corporate debt in emerging markets have also risen, albeit modestly.

Given the relative strength of the U.S. economy, the U.S. dollar has 
appreciated against most currencies (Chart 8). The strength of the U.S. 
dollar, together with lower commodity prices, has led to a depreciation of 
the Canadian dollar since October. By convention, the Canadian dollar is 
assumed to be close to its recent average of 72 cents over the projection 
horizon, compared with the 76 cents assumed in October.

Canadian Economy

Inflation in Canada is evolving broadly as expected. Total CPI inflation 
remains near the bottom of the Bank’s inflation-control range, as the 
downward pressure from declines in consumer energy prices is only par-
tially offset by the temporary boost from the pass-through of the exchange 
rate depreciation to consumer goods prices. Most of the core inflation 
measures monitored by the Bank remain close to 2 per cent, since the 
positive effects of pass-through and the disinflationary effects of eco-
nomic slack largely counterbalance each other.

Economic activity in Canada has recently been weaker than was anticipated 
in the October Report, largely because of lower commodity prices. The 
declines in Canada’s terms of trade and in the value of the Canadian dollar 
over the past year and a half have set in motion complex adjustments, 
involving significant shifts in economic activity and a reallocation of labour 
and capital that will continue over the next several years (Box 1). In the early 
stages of this process, the Canadian economy has been evolving along two 
tracks: in the resource sector, investment is being scaled back in response 
to much weaker commodity prices, job losses have been significant and 
production has been curtailed. Activity in the non-resource sector, mean-
while, has been relatively solid and is expected to be the main source of 
growth going forward. A reorientation of the Canadian economy toward 
the non-resource sector is being facilitated by the ongoing U.S. recovery, 
the lower Canadian dollar, and accommodative monetary and financial 
conditions.

National employment has been resilient in the face of job losses in the 
resource sector. This resilience, together with low household borrowing 
costs, has supported household expenditures, underpinning overall demand 
in Canada. While vulnerabilities in the household sector continue to edge 
higher, overall risks to financial stability are largely unchanged.

The Canadian Economy Continues to Undergo a Complex and Lengthy Adjustment to the 
Decline in Canada’s Terms of Trade
The plunge in commodity prices since mid-2014, combined 
with the expectation that they will remain low, has been 
a critical factor underlying developments in the Canadian 
economy (Chart 1 on page 1) and has set oﬀ  a complex and 
lengthy adjustment process . This box describes the evo-
lution of this process, as well as its channels and regional 
aspects . The structural nature of the adjustment has impli-
cations for the long-run production capacity of both the 
resource and non-resource sectors and will involve a long-
term reduction in the resource share of the economy and a 
compensating increase in the non-resource share .
The adjustment has two main channels of transmission, 
with varying eﬀ ects, timing and magnitude .1 First, the 
restructuring of the resource sector was front-loaded relative 
to other adjustments and immediately began to reduce 
potential output in that sector . The commodity-producing 
sector has shrunk rapidly, signifi cantly reducing investment 
and employment, and the eﬀ ects of this process on the level 
of GDP are expected to peak roughly in mid-2016 . Data on 
fi rm creation illustrate some of these adjustments . While 
year-over-year growth in the population of fi rms in the 
economy has been on a gradual upward trend since late 
2012, it has softened in recent quarters, with a notable con-
traction in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction .
The second main channel of the adjustment involves the 
broader real income eﬀ ects of the decline in the terms of 
trade: lower wealth and real domestic income have weighed 
on household expenditures and investment in non-resource 
industries . The eﬀ ect from this channel has been slower to 
materialize and is expected to peak much later, toward the 
end of 2017 .
At the same time, a reallocation of productive resources to 
the non-resource sector of the economy, facilitated by the 
depreciation of the exchange rate, is helping to gradually 
rebuild capacity in the non-resource sector . This source of 
support to potential output is lagging compared with the 
negative impact from developments in the resource sector . 
The timing of the reallocation to the non-resource sector is 
also more uncertain than that associated with the resource 
sector . In particular, this adjustment process is expected to 
be protracted, extending well beyond the projection horizon .

The adjustments currently taking place in the economy 
involve important regional and sectoral reallocations of 
resources . Although adjustments are still in their early 
stages, there are signs that the reallocation of labour and 
capital is under way .
In this regard, responses to the Bank’s winter Business Outlook 
Survey suggested that capacity pressures eased in the second 
half of 2015, particularly in the Prairie provinces . Excess cap-
acity was also more prevalent among domestically oriented 
fi rms than among non-commodity export-oriented fi rms, 
refl ecting signifi cant spillovers from the resource sector to 
the rest of the economy .
On the labour supply side, net interprovincial migration to 
Alberta in the third quarter of 2015 was at its lowest since 
2010 . There were fewer infl ows, especially from Ontario 
and Atlantic Canada, while more Albertans moved to British 
Columbia . At the same time, Ontario registered the largest 
infl ow of interprovincial migrants since 2002 . In terms of the 
balance of supply and demand, the ratio of unemployment to 
job vacancies has risen sharply in the energy-producing prov-
inces since the autumn of 2014, while the same measure 
has been relatively stable over the past several quarters in 
the rest of Canada (Chart 1-A) .

Note: The energy-producing provinces are Alberta, Saskatchewan, and 
 Newfoundland and Labrador.

While the Bank’s labour market indicators for British 
Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick 
have improved over the past year or so, those for the 
energy-producing provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
and Newfoundland and Labrador have deteriorated .2 
Indeed, employment outside the energy-producing 
provinces continued to increase during 2015 but fell in 
the energy-producing provinces (Chart 1-B) . Household 
expenditures across Canada mirror the diﬀ erences 
observed in regional labour market outcomes (Table 1-A) . 
Similarly, while the major housing market indicators for 
Canada as a whole are stron g, regional housing markets 
continue to evolve along diﬀ erent tracks, and the trifurca-
tion of the national market remains the dominant theme in 
this sector .3

Real GDP growth is expected to strengthen gradually through the projection 
horizon, with fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter growth of about 2 per cent 
in 2016 and about 2 1/2 per cent in 2017 (Table 2 and Table 3). The Bank’s 
projection for activity over 2016–17 has been marked down in response 
to the additional drop in commodity prices and modestly weaker demand 
for Canadian non-commodity exports. The growth trajectory reflects the 
ongoing adjustment, with the contraction in the resource sector waning 
and economic activity in the non-resource sector gaining traction. Given 
the magnitude and protracted nature of the ongoing structural adjustment,

b. In this table, the Bank has adopted a convention of showing the last quarter of historical data and the 

next three quarters, which are monitored and forecasted, as well as fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter 
projections of real GDP growth and infl ation for longer horizons.

the outlooks for both aggregate demand and potential output are highly 
uncertain. The Bank judges that growth in potential output is in the lower 
part of the range of estimates it presented in the April 2015 Report. In view 
of the setback to the economy, the Bank’s base-case projection shows the 
output gap closing later than was anticipated in October, around the end 
of 2017. However, the Bank has not yet incorporated into its projection the 
impact of fiscal measures expected in the next federal budget.

Total CPI inflation is projected to remain well below 2 per cent through 2016, 
as the downward pressure from weak year-over-year consumer energy price 
inflation and persistent excess capacity in the economy more than offset 
the upward pressure from the pass-through of the exchange rate deprecia-
tion to consumer goods prices (Table 3). Both total and core inflation are 
expected to be close to 2 per cent in 2017 once the temporary effects on 
inflation from the decline in gasoline prices and from exchange rate pass-
through dissipate and the disinflationary effects of residual excess capacity 
diminish.

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLICy REPORT  •  JANUARy 2016

Canadian EConoMy  15 

Inflation has been below 2 per cent, as expected
Total CPI inflation edged higher in the second half of 2015 but remains 
near the bottom of the Bank’s inflation-control range, with the sharp drop 
in consumer energy prices continuing to be the largest source of disinfla-
tionary pressures. At the same time, the past depreciation of the Canadian 
dollar has been exerting temporary upward pressure on the prices of many 
imported consumer goods in Canada. The effects of exchange rate pass-
through are particularly pronounced in the prices of fruits and vegetables, 
as well as in those of core goods such as appliances, clothing, reading 
material and some other food products. Aside from these transitory factors, 
slack in the Canadian economy has continued to be a source of downward 
pressure on total inflation.

During 2015, despite the downward revisions to expected real GDP growth, 
total CPI inflation was higher than anticipated (Chart 9). There were two 
key factors driving this outcome: the Canadian dollar depreciated relative 
to earlier assumptions, and gasoline prices were firmer than anticipated. 
Although gasoline prices have declined, they have not fallen as much as the 
reduction in crude oil prices would suggest, based on historical experience 
(Chart 10). For example, had gasoline prices more closely tracked develop-
ments in oil prices, the level of total CPI would have been 0.6 per cent lower 
in November 2015. In addition, the disappointment in real GDP growth was 
accompanied by a markdown in the assessment of potential output, leaving 
estimates of the degree of excess capacity in the economy broadly similar.

Most measures of core inflation remain in a narrow range, close to 2 per cent 
(Chart 11). Given the persistent slack in the economy, measures of core infla-
tion would be lower without the impact of the exchange rate pass-through. 
For example, pass-through is estimated to have boosted CPIX inflation by 
about 0.5 to 0.7 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2015, with some-
what less impact on the other measures of core inflation.

After rebounding in the third quarter, real GDP growth 
likely stalled in the fourth quarter…
Economic activity in Canada rebounded as expected in the third quarter 
of 2015, despite a further decline in oil prices and in investment in the oil 
and gas sector (Chart 12). The non-resource sector continued to expand, 
supported by a steadily strengthening U.S. economy, the past depreciation 
of the Canadian dollar and accommodative financial conditions, as well as 
by some temporary factors (Chart 13). Export growth firmed significantly, 
particularly for non-commodity exports, partly due to a short-term boost 
associated with the full resumption of motor vehicle production at plants 
that were shut down for retooling in the first half of 2015. Household

expenditures grew modestly, sustained by the resilience in employment 
outside the resource sector and a temporary lift associated with retroactive 
Universal Child Care Benefit payments.

The Bank now estimates that real GDP growth stalled in the fourth quarter 
of 2015, resulting in a more pronounced slowdown than previously 
expected. The downward revision was driven by three main factors. First, 
given important supply-chain linkages between Canada and the United 
States (e.g., in the oil and gas sector), weaker-than-expected U.S. industrial 

 

18  Canadian EConoMy

production likely weighed on Canadian exports. Second, in the context of 
declining commodity prices, business investment contracted more than 
expected. Third, a number of unanticipated temporary factors, including 
strikes in the public sector in Quebec and short-term downtime in the mining 
sector, dragged down economic activity.

…and the degree of slack in the economy has been 
increasing
Estimates of the Bank’s two measures of the output gap—the structural and 
statistical approaches—point to material and increasing excess capacity in 
the Canadian economy through 2015 (Chart 14).1

Labour market data also indicate continued slack, and there is little evi-
dence of wage pressures. Similarly, the Bank’s winter Business Outlook 
Survey reported that the incidence of labour shortages remains low and 
their intensity continues to trend downward. Given the magnitude of the 
commodity price shock, the Canadian labour market has performed rela-
tively well: total employment growth was solid during 2015, with gains out-
side the resource sector more than offsetting losses in the resource sector; 
the incidence of involuntary part-time work declined noticeably; and the 
duration of periods of unemployment has also fallen (Chart 15).

The unemployment rate, however, has increased to 7.1 per cent. Although 
net job gains over the past year were concentrated in full-time positions, 
many of these were in the category of self-employment, which is historically 
associated with weak economic activity. Underlying these national indica-
tors are the diverging trends between the energy-producing provinces and 
the rest of the country, notably the rapid deterioration of labour market con-
ditions in Alberta, as indicated by sharp increases in the unemployment rate 
and employment insurance claims in that province. Moreover, employment 
growth in late 2015 was more modest than the relatively strong performance

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLICy REPORT  •  JANUARy 2016

Accommodative financial conditions are supporting 
ongoing adjustments
Financing conditions for households and businesses in Canada remain 
highly stimulative (Chart 17). Reductions in the Bank’s policy interest rate 
in January and July 2015 contributed importantly to these accommoda-
tive financial conditions. For example, yields on 5-year Government of 
Canada bonds are now roughly 80 basis points below their average level in 
December 2014. However, bank funding costs have been edging up more 
recently, prompting some financial institutions to increase mortgage rates by 
about 5 to 15 basis points. As a result, effective borrowing rates for house-
holds, while still low, have risen slightly since the October Report.

While growth in business credit has continued to moderate in recent 
months, most firms surveyed in the Bank’s winter Business Outlook Survey 
still characterized credit as easy or relatively easy to obtain. Credit spreads 
have widened on high-yield bonds, reflecting a pickup in market volatility 
and declines in the valuations of riskier assets globally. In particular, issuers 
of corporate debt in the energy and resource sectors are facing higher 
borrowing costs and tighter credit conditions, based on responses to the 
Bank’s Senior Loan Officer Survey for the fourth quarter of 2015.

Lower commodity prices are depressing activity in the 
resource sector
The prices for oil and other commodities have declined since October, 
and the uncertainty around the evolution of prices remains pronounced. In 
response, firms in the oil and gas sector have again revised down capital 
spending plans, a possibility highlighted in the October Report (Box 2). 
Weaker profitability and sharply lower capital expenditures in the oil and 
gas sector will further reduce production and exports of energy over the 
medium term. Likewise, in the non-energy commodity sector, lower prices

and competitiveness issues are expected to add to constraints on mining 
activity. Consequently, the weakness in resource exports and investment 
will be more pronounced and more persistent than previously anticipated.

It is important to note that currently assumed prices for oil are approaching 
break-even prices on a cash flow (i.e., average variable cost) basis for 
many producers. As a result, there are greater downside than upside risks 
to production and investment stemming from oil price movements. Some 
firms have indicated that if prices were to fall further, threshold effects

Box 2

The Oil and Gas Sector: Industry Perspectives 
Canada’s oil and gas sector continues to undergo a diﬃ  cult 
adjustment in response to ongoing declines in the prices for 
oil and natural gas . 
The short-term price expectations of fi rms continue to fall, 
along with the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) . In 
September and October, discussions with energy fi rms sug-
gested that US$45 per barrel of WTI was viewed as a price 
fl oor . However, prices have since fallen below US$35 per 
barrel, forcing many to re-evaluate their plans once more . In 
2015, many producers had a sizable share of their produc-
tion hedged at relatively high prices . For 2016, they now 
have a smaller share of production hedged at signifi cantly 
lower prices . Moreover, believing that oil prices would 
recover, many fi rms were reluctant to lock in hedges at 
US$50 per barrel, exposing them to the recent decline in 
prices . This is particularly true for junior and intermediate 
producers . Firms with integrated operations in the oil sands 
had been benefi ting from higher refi ning margins, but they 
will see those erode as well . That said, medium-term price 
expectations remain positive, largely because of the view 
that deep cuts in capital expenditures globally are setting 
the stage for tighter supply in the future and therefore an 
eventual recovery in prices .
In light of the challenging environment, fi rms cut capital 
spending by about 40 per cent in 2015 . Recent discussions 
with energy fi rms indicate that spending would be cut by 
roughly 25 per cent in 2016 (compared with the 20 per cent 
cut anticipated for 2016 in October) should WTI prices 
remain close to current levels (Chart 2-A) .
In addition to cutting capital expenditures, companies in 
the energy sector have worked to improve their competi-
tiveness by lowering their costs signifi cantly, squeezing 
suppliers’ prices, reducing ineﬃ  ciencies and increasing 
productivity . They have also trimmed labour costs through 
layoﬀ s and by cutting salaries and bonuses . 
Further cost reductions are becoming more diﬃ  cult to 
achieve, however . Many fi rms indicate that neither they nor 
their suppliers are able to generate additional substantial 
cost savings or productivity increases in the short term .

Unlike conventional oil producers, oil sands producers fi nd 
it diﬃ  cult and expensive to scale back production, causing 
some to operate temporarily at a loss . With low oil prices 
persisting, fi rms anticipate more painful wage and staﬀ  
cuts ahead . Consequently, remaining competitive at low 
prices will require more fundamental structural change, 
including consolidation in the sector . Even at prices between 
US$40 and US$50 for WTI, many energy executives view 
the current composition of the industry as unsustainable . 
Struggling companies that are unable to remain competitive 
will restructure or exit the industry, while healthier com-
panies will look for opportunities to purchase distressed 
assets and improve scale eﬃ  ciencies . At the same time, 
new companies with diﬀ erent strategies and lower cost 
structures will emerge . 
As the industry reshapes itself to cope with low oil prices, 
the necessary structural adjustments will require more 
fundamental changes to operations and could be more pro-
found than the already diﬃ  cult adjustments made in 2015 .

would occur. A sustained price increase of a given amount might not have a 
material impact on the investment and production decisions of firms; how-
ever, a sustained price decrease of the same amount could force some firms 
to cease operations, triggering sharp falls in production, investment and 
employment, and lead to expectations of more consolidation in the industry.

Non-commodity exports sensitive to the exchange rate 
are expected to outperform…
The past depreciation of the Canadian dollar is helping to improve the price 
competitiveness of Canadian exports and import-competing goods and 
services, although the currencies of other competing commodity-producing 
economies, such as Australia, Mexico, Chile and Brazil, have also depreci-
ated relative to the U.S. dollar.3 Non-commodity exports will also be sup-
ported by continued growth in foreign demand.

Growth in non-commodity goods exports has been led by components that 
are sensitive to movements in the Canadian dollar, roughly two-thirds of 
which are showing positive momentum and are outperforming those that are 
less exchange rate sensitive.

While the growth of non-energy exports slowed in late 2015, many subcat-
egories of non-energy-commodity and non-commodity goods exports—
such as potash, seafood products, and ships, locomotives and rapid transit 
equipment—showed sizable gains during 2015 (Chart 18 and Chart 19).

In the services sector, travel services have benefited from the lower 
Canadian dollar and the resulting change in travel patterns. The number 
of international visitors to Canada has picked up, while the number of 
Canadians going abroad has declined (Chart 20).

The Bank’s latest Business Outlook Survey indicated that firms engaged 
in non-commodity exports are more optimistic about growth in their sales 
prospects over the coming year than firms that are more oriented toward 
domestic sales. In this context, the survey provides continued evidence of 
firms actively pivoting their sales efforts toward faster-growing foreign mar-
kets and highlights the facilitating role played by the lower Canadian dollar.

…which should support a pickup in business investment 
outside the resource sector
Business investment is expected to expand starting in the second half of 
this year as the drag from reductions in spending in the oil and gas sector 
dissipates (Chart 21). However, the latest Business Outlook Survey indicated 
a further deterioration in investment intentions in the Prairies, and weakening 
is now evident in other regions as well.

Outside the resource sector, investment is expected to strengthen grad-
ually, similar to that already experienced in the United States: in the winter 
Business Outlook Survey, a number of firms reported that robust exports are 
leading to stronger spending intentions. Exporters not tied to commodities 
have positive investment intentions overall in response to stronger foreign 
demand and the boost to competitiveness coming from the lower dollar 
(Chart 22).4 As domestic production becomes more competitive, a few firms 
reported plans to move production back to Canada. The survey results also 
indicate that the lower Canadian dollar is helping to support competitive-
ness for domestically oriented firms. For instance, tourism-related activity 
has increased and further gains are expected.

The Business Outlook Survey also highlighted some challenges from the 
lower Canadian dollar: the majority of firms surveyed face higher costs 
for imported inputs and investment goods, and some plan to respond by 
switching from foreign to Canadian suppliers.

Household expenditures are expected to expand 
moderately
Household expenditures are expected to continue to grow at a moderate 
pace over the projection period. The loss of income and wealth associated 
with the deterioration in the terms of trade will have a dampening effect on 
spending. This effect will be gradually offset, however, by growth in the non-
resource sector, which will help to support labour demand and income and 
thus household expenditures.

Over the projection horizon, consumption is expected to grow roughly in line 
with disposable income. At the same time, as a result of the past deprecia-
tion of the Canadian dollar, domestic consumption patterns are expected to 
shift toward domestically produced goods and services.

Major Canadian housing market indicators remain strong: yearly growth in 
house prices is robust, sales of existing homes are above their historical 
average and the recent pace of housing starts exceeds demographic 
demand. Strength in national indicators is being driven primarily by elevated 
activity in two markets—Greater Toronto and Vancouver. Over the projection 
horizon, regional divergences in housing activity are expected to gradually 
fade and the contribution to real GDP growth from residential investment will 
decline.

Low interest rates and higher house prices have led to strong growth in 
mortgage credit, recently pushing up the year-over-year growth of overall 
household credit to 5 per cent. Looking ahead, despite recent increases, 
mortgage and consumer borrowing rates are still low and are expected to 
continue to support mortgage and consumer credit growth. Consequently, 
the overall ratio of debt to disposable income will likely edge higher in the 
near term.

However, as the economy strengthens and household borrowing rates begin 
to normalize over the projection horizon, the housing market and household 
indebtedness are expected to stabilize. This will help reduce the disparity 
between house price and credit growth on one hand and nominal household 
income growth on the other.

The drop in commodity prices and its impact on income and wealth will con-
tinue to put downward pressure on government revenues. However, overall, 
fiscal policy in Canada is expected to provide an increasing contribution to 
economic growth over the projection horizon. The Bank’s base-case eco-
nomic scenario reflects the fiscal measures announced since the October 
Report, notably the increase in expenditures contained in the Alberta budget 
and changes to federal marginal income tax rates introduced at the begin-
ning of 2016. Combined, these additional measures are estimated to provide 
modest support to economic activity, raising the level of real GDP at the end 
of 2016 by about 0.1 per cent.

The federal government has indicated that further fiscal policy measures are 
likely to occur. These measures are not included in the base-case scenario 
and represent an important upside risk to the outlook. The nature of this 
upside risk depends on the timing, size and types of fiscal measures. In 
particular, government infrastructure investment tends to generate broader 
spillovers to the economy and thus is associated with larger multipliers than 
other forms of government spending or changes in taxes or transfers. At the 
same time, infrastructure spending typically involves longer lags between 
decisions to increase spending and actual expenditures.

Excess capacity is expected to diminish through 2017
Given the magnitude and pace of the commodity price decline and the 
complexity and protracted nature of the adjustment process—with important 
structural and cyclical implications—there is particular uncertainty about the 
recovery in aggregate demand and economic activity, the level and evolution 
of potential output, and thus the timing of the economy’s return to full potential.

On an average annual basis, growth is expected to increase to 1.4 per cent in 
2016 before firming to 2.4 per cent in 2017 (Table 2). The ongoing weakness 
in investment suggests that potential output growth is more likely to be in the 
lower part of the Bank’s range of estimates presented in the April 2015 Report.

The contraction of investment is expected to end around the middle of 2016. 
In the second quarter, real GDP growth is projected to begin to exceed 
potential growth, leading to a narrowing of the output gap. In view of the 
extraordinary uncertainty, in the Bank’s base-case projection, the Canadian 
economy is expected to return to potential later than anticipated in the 
October Report, around the end of 2017.

Inflation is expected to remain close to 2 per cent, 
beginning in 2017
Total CPI inflation is expected to remain well below 2 per cent through 
2016, as disinflationary pressures associated with weak year-over-year 
gasoline price inflation and excess capacity in the Canadian economy more 
than offset the positive effects of exchange rate pass-through on inflation 
(Chart 23). The significant disinflationary effect of lower gasoline prices will 
fade through 2016, although downward pressure associated with a return 
to a more typical relationship between gasoline and crude oil prices is 
expected through most of the year.

The Bank estimates that the upward pressure on total CPI inflation from 
exchange rate pass-through was about 0.9 to 1.1 percentage points in the 
fourth quarter of 2015. Based on the assumption of a Canadian dollar at 
72 cents U.S., the effect of pass-through is expected to gradually decline 
through 2016 and into 2017. However, given the depreciation of the Canadian 
dollar in recent months, there is a risk that pass-through will remain higher 
before declining. In 2017, the residual upward pressure from pass-through 
and the modest downward pressure associated with remaining excess 
capacity will largely counterbalance each other so that total CPI inflation and 
core inflation are projected to be close to 2 per cent (Chart 24).

Medium-term inflation expectations have continued to be well anchored at 
2 per cent. The January Consensus Economics forecast for total CPI infla-
tion was 1.8 per cent for 2016 and 2.0 per cent for 2017. While results from 
the Bank’s winter Business Outlook Survey indicate that a large majority 
of firms continued to expect CPI inflation to remain within the Bank’s 1 to 
3 per cent inflation-control range over the next two years, a greater propor-
tion expected inflation to be in the lower half of that range.

Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, a reasonable range 
around the base-case projection for total CPI inflation is ±0.3 percentage 
points. This range is intended to convey a sense of forecast uncertainty. Fan 
charts, which are derived using statistical analysis of the Bank’s forecast 
errors, provide a complementary perspective (Chart 25 and Chart 26).

Risks to thE inflation outlook  29 

Risks to the inflation outlook

Anticipated fiscal measures are not incorporated into the 
Bank’s projection
The Bank’s base-case projection is consistent with fiscal policy announce-
ments made by federal and provincial governments up to January 2016. 
Recent public statements by senior government officials indicate that the 
upcoming federal budget will include additional fiscal stimulus. This stimulus 
will boost domestic demand relative to that in the base-case projection, 
pulling forward the closing of the output gap. The size and timing of the 
effects, however, will depend on the details of the measures. When more 
details become available, the Bank will assess the impact of the fiscal 
package on the outlook for growth. 

Aside from the prospective fiscal measures, the Bank’s outlook is subject 
to several risks emanating from both the external environment and the 
domestic economy. The Bank judges the following risks to be roughly bal-
anced over the projection horizon. 

Macroeconomic risks
(i) 

Lower potential output
The commodity price shock has sparked a complex set of structural 
adjustments within the Canadian economy. In the resource sector, 
investment has been sharply curtailed and labour reductions con-
tinue. At the same time, capital and labour are being reallocated to 
the non-resource sector, a process that will take years to unfold and 
that has important consequences for the level and growth rate of 
potential output. By their nature, these consequences are difficult to 
estimate. The Bank judges that, to date, the adjustments mean that 
near-term potential output growth is likely in the lower part of the 
range of estimates provided in the April 2015 Report. However, there 
is considerable uncertainty around assessments of the impact of 
the commodity price shock on the level and growth rate of potential 
output. Consequently, the starting point and expected profile of the 
output gap may be narrower, posing an upside risk to inflation.

(ii)  Greater exchange rate pass-through

The pass-through from the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar 
to total inflation is expected to average 0.7 percentage points in 2016. 
Given the size and speed of the depreciation, there is a risk that pass-
through may be greater than expected based on historical experience. 

 

 

30  Risks to thE inflation outlook 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLICy REPORT  •  JANUARy 2016

 

When a large depreciation occurs over a short period, the pass-
through to prices could be relatively rapid and thus have a greater 
impact on annual inflation. In such a situation, inflation expectations 
might increase, posing an upside risk to projected inflation.

(iii)  Lower oil prices and threshold effects

Given the magnitude of the oil price decline, it is becoming increas-
ingly likely that important adverse threshold effects on economic 
activity may occur. If prices were to fall to a sufficiently low level that 
a firm had difficulty covering ongoing operating costs (i.e., average 
variable costs), then not only would investment and employment be 
affected, but the firm could also stop operating and be forced into 
bankruptcy. The relevant thresholds differ across firms. If a significant 
part of the industry were affected by thresholds, the resulting negative 
confidence effects and demand spillovers could weigh heavily on the 
broader economy. 

(iv)  Slower growth in emerging-market economies

A number of factors could impair EME growth. For example, growth in 
China may slow more than expected while authorities work to rebal-
ance its economy. Brazil and some other EMEs also could experi-
ence weaker growth as they adjust to declines in their terms of trade 
and higher volatility in capital flows. Weaker growth in EMEs would 
dampen U.S. exports (which often have considerable Canadian con-
tent), further undermine confidence, push down commodity prices, 
and increase uncertainty and financial volatility.

Canada’s infl ation-control strategy
Canada’s infl ation-control strategy1
Infl ation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote the 

economic and fi nancial well-being of Canadians.

  Canada’s experience with infl ation targeting since 1991 has shown 
that the best way to foster confi dence in the value of money and to 
contribute to sustained economic growth, employment gains and 
improved living standards is by keeping infl ation low, stable and 
predictable.

 

In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 
Canada’s infl ation-control target for a further fi ve-year period, ending 
December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the rate of infl ation 
of the consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 percent midpoint 
of the control range of 1 to 3 percent.

Monetary policy tools
  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight 

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent 

communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the 
economy and infl ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on 
eight pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s 
outlook are published four times each year in the Monetary Policy 
Report.

Infl ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible
  Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means 
that the Bank is equally concerned about infl ation rising above or 
falling below the 2 percent target.

  Canada’s infl ation-targeting framework is ﬂ exible. Typically, the 

Bank seeks to return infl ation to target over a horizon of six to eight 
quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning 
infl ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence 
of the shocks buffeting the economy.

quarters—to work their way through the economy and have their 
full effect on infl ation. For this reason, monetary policy must be 
forward-looking.

Monitoring infl ation
 

  The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes in 

the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate).2 The Bank 
also has a range of other monetary policy tools it can use when the 
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on 
the future evolution of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases 
(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures, 
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these 
additional tools would depend on the economic and fi nancial market 
context.

  All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for 

Canadian goods and services through their infl uence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The 
balance between this demand and the economy’s production 
capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl ation 
pressures in the economy.

In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in 
indirect taxes such as the goods and services tax/harmonized sales 
tax, can cause sizable fl uctuations in CPI infl ation.

 

In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such 
transitory movements in CPI infl ation and focuses on a set of “core” 
infl ation measures that better refl ect the underlying trend of infl ation. 
In this sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the 
Bank achieve the CPI infl ation target. They are not a replacement for 
CPI infl ation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl ation are CPI-trim, 
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given 
month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which corresponds to 
the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket 
weight) of the distribution of price changes; and CPI-common, which 
uses a statistical procedure to track common price changes across 
categories in the CPI basket.

Inﬂ ation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

Overview
Overview

Rising vaccination rates and easing health restrictions are supporting the 
economic recovery in Canada and other major economies (Chart 1 and 
Box 1). However, the Delta variant of COVID-19 has caused case numbers 
in some countries to rise. Emerging-market and developing economies with 
lower vaccination rates and less fiscal and monetary policy support are 
particularly affected.

Economic activity and inflation have picked up in the second half of 2021 
in Canada and globally. As a result, central banks in several advanced 
economies have reduced the extent of their monetary stimulus or signalled 
their intention to do so.

Supply disruptions and energy constraints are weighing on growth and 
pushing up prices in many economies, including Canada’s. Employment has 
increased, but labour market recoveries remain incomplete.

Key messages
  The Canadian economy is once again growing robustly.

  Strong employment gains in hard-to-distance sectors have significantly 

reduced the uneven impact of the pandemic on workers. Despite 
continuing overall slack in the labour market, some businesses are having 
difficulty finding workers quickly enough to meet increasing demand. 

  Disruptions to global supply chains have intensified, limiting the production 

of some goods and leading to both higher costs and higher prices. 

  Although the impact and persistence of these supply factors are difficult 
to quantify, they suggest the output gap is likely narrower than projected 
in July. The Bank now expects economic slack will be absorbed sometime 
in the middle quarters of 2022, although the very unusual challenges of 
reopening an economy make this timing more uncertain than usual.

  Given persistent supply constraints and the increase in energy prices, 

the Bank expects inflation to stay above the control range for longer than 
previously anticipated, before easing back to close to the 2 percent target 
by late 2022.

  The Bank views the risks around this inflation outlook as roughly balanced. 

However, with inflation above the top of the Bank’s inflation-control range 
and expected to stay there for some time, the upside risks are of greater 
concern.

Key inputs to the projection
The Bank of Canada’s projection is always conditional 
on several key assumptions, and changes to them will 
affect the outlook for the Canadian economy. The Bank 
regularly reviews these assumptions and assesses the 
sensitivity of the economic projection to them. The key 
inputs into the Bank’s projection are as follows:

  Vaccination rollouts are progressing in many regions 
of the globe (Chart 1). The majority of public health 
restrictions and voluntary physical distancing 
measures are assumed to be lifted over the course 
of 2022. These restrictions and measures are 
expected to remain in place longer in emerging-
market economies because of lower rates of 
vaccination.

  Most public health restrictions in Canada should 
be eased by the end of 2021. Pandemic-related 
effects on demand—notably, consumer caution 
and reluctance to travel—are assumed to diminish 
gradually over the projection horizon. Households 
are assumed to spend 20 percent of the extra 
savings they have accumulated during the pandemic 
on consumption.

  The projection incorporates $108 billion in federal 
fi scal stimulus, in line with the 2021 federal budget.

  Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent levels. 

The per-barrel prices in US dollars are assumed to 
be $80 for Brent, $75 for West Texas Intermediate 
and $65 for Western Canadian Select—each $5 
higher than assumed in the July Report.

  By convention, the Bank does not forecast the 
exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. 
The Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at 
80 cents US over the projection horizon, close to its 
recent average and somewhat below the 81 cents 
US assumed in the July Report.

  The pandemic and related containment measures 

and supply chain disruptions are having both 
temporary and lasting negative effects on the supply 
side of the Canadian economy.1 
  The Bank’s assessment of the growth of 

potential output, a longer-term concept, looks 
through the short-lived effects of factors such 
as containment measures and supply chain 

disruptions. Potential output growth is assumed 
to average about 1.6 percent per year over 
2021–23, approximately 0.2 percentage points 
lower than estimated in the July Report. This 
change mainly refl ects the lower trajectory for 
business investment. As a result, the level of 
potential output in 2023 is projected to be about 
1 percent below the pre-pandemic estimate.2

  The projection assumes that the supply of goods 

and services is no longer signifi cantly affected 
by domestic containment measures but that it is 
adversely affected by other short-term factors. 
First, global supply chain disruptions are having 
a large temporary impact on supply. Second, 
the mismatch between employers’ needs 
and unemployed workers’ skills, exacerbated 
by the unevenness of the pandemic shock, 
is contributing to the temporary rise in long-
term unemployment. Together, these effects are 
assumed to reduce supply, with a peak impact 
of about 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 
2021. These effects are expected to dissipate 
gradually over 2022.

  Estimates of overall supply growth can be 
obtained by combining the estimates of the 
temporary effects of the supply chain disruptions 
with the assessment of potential output.

  GDP growth resumed amid increased supply 

disruptions in the third quarter. The Bank estimates 
that the output gap—the difference between gross 
domestic product and supply—was about -2.25 to 
-1.25 percent in the third quarter, smaller than the 
revised estimate of -3.25 to -2.25 percent in the 
second quarter.

  The neutral nominal policy interest rate is defi ned 
as the real rate consistent with output remaining 
sustainably at its potential and with infl ation at target, 
on an ongoing basis, plus 2 percent for infl ation. It 
is a medium- to long-term equilibrium concept. For 
Canada, the economic projection is based on an 
assumption that the neutral rate is at the midpoint 
of the estimated range of 1.75 to 2.75 percent. This 
range was last reassessed in the April 2021 Report.

1  As in recent reports, the Bank makes the distinction between supply and 

potential output in the near term to account for the relatively short-lived nature 
of some of the decrease in supply caused by containment measures and, 
starting with this Report, supply chain disruptions.

Global economy

Global economic activity continues to improve, but progress remains choppy 
and uneven. The recovery has a firmer foundation in advanced economies 
than in emerging-market economies (EMEs) because of higher vaccination 
rates and more stimulative policy measures. Labour market improvements 
continue to be uneven and incomplete in many countries. 

Activity in the United States has been recovering solidly, although the Delta 
variant has slowed progress in recent months. China’s economy is facing 
headwinds that are restraining growth. In other EMEs and the euro area, 
growth is resuming as restrictions related to COVID-19 are eased further. 

Major energy disruptions in various parts of the world are affecting economic 
activity and pushing up costs and inflation. Transportation bottlenecks and 
supply shortages of many goods are also limiting growth and putting upward 
pressure on the prices of some goods, especially in North America (Chart 2, 
Box 2). These pressures on inflation are expected to persist until the second 
half of 2022.

GLOBAL ECONOMy  5 

Infl ation rising globally as prices recover from 2020 lows
Infl ation has risen above target in many advanced 
economies, including those of the United States, 
Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany, and has 
generally risen further in emerging-market economies 
(EMEs), including Brazil, Russia and Mexico. Higher 
prices for food and energy and pass-through from 
exchange rate depreciations are adding to infl ationary 
pressures in many EMEs. If infl ation expectations begin 
to de-anchor from the target, higher infl ation could 
persist. In response to concerns about the infl ation 
outlook, monetary policy has been tightened in certain 
EMEs, such as Brazil, Russia and Mexico. 

However, infl ation remains relatively low in Japan, 
China and a number of other economies. These global 
divergences in infl ation result from differences in the 
extent of economic slack, historical experiences with 
infl ation, and infl ation expectations. Other idiosyncratic 
factors, including exchange rate effects , have also 
contributed.

The recent increases in infl ation experienced in some 
countries are driven mostly by transitory factors that are 
boosting the level of prices: 

  The rebound in prices for energy and other 

commodities from their pandemic-induced low levels 

in 2020 is adding to headline infl ation everywhere. 
Rising food prices are a main contributor, especially 
in EMEs where food is a larger share of the 
consumption basket. One notable exception is 
pork prices in China, which are putting downward 
pressure on infl ation in that country as supply 
recovers from the impacts of African swine fever.

  For some services, such as transportation and 

hospitality, prices that fell at the beginning of the 
pandemic have started to rise in certain regions. 
This is particularly true in advanced economies, 
refl ecting increased demand. 

  Prices of some durable goods have increased 
sharply because of the surge in demand amid 
supply constraints, such as that experienced with 
the global shortage of semiconductors. Additionally, 
health and physical distancing restrictions at 
ports and factories are contributing to production 
disruptions and higher shipping costs. 

These factors are causing a rapid increase in year-
over-year infl ation. However, changes in prices from 
two years ago are considerably less pronounced in 
advanced economies (Chart 2-A).

Overall, the Bank projects growth of global gross domestic product (GDP) to 
rise to 6.5 percent in 2021—a very strong pace but slower than projected in 
the July Report (Table 1, Box 3). Global growth is expected to moderate in 
2022 and 2023 as the recovery moves beyond the rebound phase and the 
effects of policy stimulus fade.

Changes to the economic  projection since the July Report
Global GDP outlook
The growth outlook for global gross domestic product 
(GDP) has been revised down since the July Report, 
by about 0.3 percentage points on average for 
2021 and 2022. For 2023, it has been revised up by 
0.2 percentage points.1

The following factors explain the downward revisions to 
projected growth in 2021 and 2022:

  The outbreak of the Delta variant of COVID-19 

appears to have had a larger negative impact than 
estimated in July on consumption in China, other 
emerging-market economies (EMEs) and the United 
States.

1  The level of global GDP at the end of 2023 is only 0.2 percent lower than 

projected in the July Report due to signifi cant positive historical revisions to 
the GDP of oil-importing emerging-market economies and the euro area.

  US government expenditures for the second quarter 

of 2021 were signifi cantly weaker than anticipated. 
The projection now assumes that US stimulus 
funds will be spent at a slower pace than what was 
assumed in the July Report.

  The effects of supply-chain disruptions on spending 

and prices are proving to be larger and more 
persistent than expected, particularly in the United 
States.

  Regulatory changes in China to property and other 

sectors are expected to weigh on housing and 
business investment.

Box 3 (continued)

Canadian GDP outlook
GDP growth in Canada in the third quarter of 2021 
has been revised down by about 1¾ percentage 
points, to around 5½ percent. The rebound in exports, 
consumption and business investment is expected 
to be weaker, stemming mostly from the impacts of 
supply chain disruptions. Housing market activity is also 
anticipated to decline at a somewhat faster pace.

GDP growth has been revised down by about 
1 percentage point in 2021, to around 5 percent. As a 
result, the level of real GDP is about 1½ percent lower 
at the end of 2021 (Chart 3-A). GDP growth has been 
revised down by about ¼ percentage point in 2022 
and revised up by about ½ percentage point in 2023. 
Overall, these revisions leave the level of real GDP 
about ¾ percent lower by the end of 2023, roughly in 
line with the downward revision to potential output (see 
Box 1).
The lower projected outlook for GDP over 2022 and 
2023 is largely due to greater and more persistent 
supply disruptions and weaker foreign demand.

Canadian CPI infl ation outlook
Consumer price index (CPI) infl ation is expected to be 
higher than projected in July. CPI infl ation is revised 
up by about 0.4 percentage points in 2021, to around 
3.4 percent. The outlook for CPI infl ation is revised 
up by roughly 1 percentage point in 2022, to about 
3.4 percent, and by about 0.1 percentage points in 
2023, to around 2.3 percent. These upward revisions 
refl ect the larger and more lasting impacts from supply 
constraints as well as higher energy prices.

Financial conditions remain accommodative
Financial conditions continue to support economic activity. In advanced 
economies, corporate bond spreads are still narrow and equity price indexes 
are generally near their historical highs. Although they remain low, yields on 
10-year government bonds are higher than noted in the July Report. This 
is partly due to elevated inflation expectations reported in market-based 
indicators and private sector forecasts. In response to improved economic 
conditions and rising inflation, several central banks in advanced economies 
are reducing or signalling their intentions to reduce the pace of their asset 
purchases. Some central banks, especially in EMEs, have also raised their 
policy rate.

GLOBAL ECONOMy  8 

Strong but slower growth in the United States
US GDP grew at a strong pace in the first half of the year and has surpassed 
its pre-pandemic output level. The recovery of the labour market, however, 
is progressing more slowly. While the rate of job openings is near a record 
high, the employment rate remains below its pre-pandemic level for most 
categories of workers. Aggregate measures of wage growth have recently 
increased, with the pickup concentrated in certain industries—including 
leisure and hospitality—that have reopened rapidly. 

GDP growth is expected to slow in the second half of 2021, reflecting a 
moderation in consumption growth. This is partly because the positive impacts 
of past government transfers are fading and the temporary resurgence of 
COVID-19 cases over the summer has dampened growth in hard-to-distance 
services. Transportation bottlenecks and shortages of semiconductors and 
construction materials continue to limit production in some sectors that 
are important for Canadian exports, such as motor vehicles and parts and 
construction. These supply chain disruptions are now projected to last until the 
second half of 2022, after which production in these sectors should improve. 

In 2022 and 2023, solid consumption growth is expected to support GDP as 
households begin to spend some of the savings they accumulated during 
the pandemic. The projection also assumes an additional US$1.5 trillion 
of government spending on infrastructure and research and development 
spread over eight years starting in 2022. 

Overall, US GDP is expected to grow by 5.6 percent in 2021, a slower pace 
than projected in the July Report (Box 3). Growth is anticipated to moderate 
in 2022 and 2023 as the economic rebound from the pandemic ends and 
spending from fiscal stimulus packages wanes. 

US personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation is expected to rise to 
close to 5 percent in the second half of 2021. It will likely peak in the fourth 
quarter and then gradually decrease as the temporary effects of supply 
shortages dissipate and energy prices stabilize. However, PCE inflation is 
expected to remain above 2 percent over the projection horizon. 

Euro area economy supported by easing of restrictions
Euro area GDP is expected to continue its strong rebound in the second half of 
2021. High vaccination rates have allowed for an easing of health restrictions, 
which supports spending on hard-to-distance services. Policy measures also 
continue to bolster domestic demand. Growth is projected to moderate in 
2022 and 2023 as the initial effects of the reopening and fiscal stimulus fade. 

China’s economy facing several headwinds 
China’s GDP is expected to grow by about 8 percent in 2021 due to solid 
momentum from late 2020. However, growth has been slowing recently and 
is expected to average just above 2 percent in the second half of 2021. Efforts 
to contain the pandemic, as well as energy shortages and past fiscal and 
monetary policy tightening, have restrained this growth. In addition, property 
sector regulations implemented starting in 2020 are causing housing activity 
to decrease. As a result, some property developers are experiencing financial 
distress. Other regulatory changes in a wide range of sectors, including 
technology and education, are also expected to weigh on business investment. 
Growth is projected to slow to below 6 percent in 2022 and 2023. Uncertainty 
about the property sector and the impact of recent regulatory changes is high 
and could result in weaker-than-expected growth over the projection horizon.

EME growth hindered by a shortage of vaccines 
After contracting sharply in the second quarter, economic activity in other oil-
importing EMEs is expected to bounce back in the second half of the year. 
This is supported by the decline in daily COVID-19 cases and the easing 
of some health restrictions. However, GDP growth in 2022 and 2023 is 
projected to slow relative to 2021 as the initial rebound phase passes. Slow 
vaccine rollouts and the lack of policy support are expected to continue to 
curtail growth in many EMEs. 

In the rest-of-the-world group (see Table 1), economic activity continues 
to strengthen. Increases in oil production and prices have been boosting 
growth in this group’s oil-exporting economies. Robust vaccination rollouts 
in advanced economies and the associated easing of restrictions are also 
supporting activity. 

Rising energy prices
Production of oil and natural gas has struggled to keep up with strengthening 
demand. At the same time, temporary supply outages and low inventory 
levels for oil and natural gas have driven energy prices up since the 
July Report (Chart 3, panel a). US oil and gas producers remain cautious 
about increasing production. As well, members of the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC (OPEC+) oil 
producers continue to increase output only moderately despite high prices.

The prices of Brent, West Texas Intermediate and Western Canadian Select 
oil have risen and in the projection are assumed to be US$80, US$75 and 
US$65, respectively, each US$5 higher than in the July Report (Box 1). In 
the near term, temporary supply outages, rapid growth in demand and low 
global stocks could continue to support prices above these assumed levels. 
In the medium term, the likelihood of further increases of OPEC+ production 
in 2022 and an expansion of US output could pull oil prices down. Prices of 
natural gas are expected to remain high through the winter before easing in 
2022 as peak seasonal demand passes and production picks up.

Prices have fluctuated significantly since the July Report for several 
components in the Bank’s non-energy commodity price index (Chart 3, 
panel b). Sharp increases in global energy prices and regulatory actions in 
China to reduce carbon emissions have led to lower production and higher 
prices for aluminum and a number of other base metals. These changes have 
also resulted in decreased steel production and consequently a drop in prices 
of iron ore. Prices of forestry products have increased since the July Report. 
Markets expect non-energy commodity prices to remain elevated over the 
projection horizon due to a mix of strong global demand and limited supply.

CANADIAN ECONOMy  11 

Canadian economy
Canadian economy

The Canadian economy is once again growing robustly, enabled by a high 
vaccination rate and the associated easing of containment measures. 
While the Delta variant is requiring continued public health precautions and 
weighing on consumer confidence, domestic demand has continued to 
recover. In particular, spending on hard-to-distance services has rebounded 
solidly. High vaccination rates have also reduced the risk to the economy of 
further widespread closures.

The labour market is recovering with a rebound in employment in hard-to-
distance sectors. Despite an unemployment rate that remains above its 
pre-pandemic level, some firms are facing challenges finding workers.

Strong demand, globally and in Canada, has run up against persistent supply 
constraints that are limiting production and increasing costs. As a result, prices 
of some goods, particularly those impacted by global supply disruptions, are 
rising quickly. Bottlenecks and shortages are leading to production slowdowns, 
delayed or cancelled purchases, and lower investment. Energy supply 
disruptions in other countries are negatively affecting their manufacturing 
sectors, which in turn could exacerbate production slowdowns in Canada. 

Annual growth in economic activity is forecast to be around 5 percent in 
2021. Growth is projected to be about 4¼ percent in 2022 and 3 ¾ percent 
in 2023 (Table 2). Continued progress on managing COVID-19—both 
domestically and globally—should reduce uncertainty and cautiousness. In 
turn, this will boost consumption, exports and business investment. While 
the economy is likely to continue to require fiscal and monetary support, the 
recovery is becoming broader and more self-sustaining.

Overall, the outlook is for robust growth into 2022, but the pace has 
been revised down since the July Report because of more severe supply 
disruptions and weaker foreign demand (Box 3). Estimates of the adverse 
impacts of supply disruptions in 2021 and into 2022 have been revised 
up. Because supply is revised down by more than GDP, the output gap is 
narrower at the start of the projection than previously expected.

Significant uncertainty surrounds the outlook for GDP and potential output. In 
particular, the impacts of supply disruptions, labour market mismatches and 
accelerated digital investments remain difficult to quantify. 

Consumer price index (CPI) inflation is expected to remain elevated for the 
rest of 2021 and into 2022 due to ongoing supply disruptions created by the 
pandemic and higher energy prices. Inflation is expected to ease to about 
2 percent by the end of 2022 as these pressures dissipate. Inflation is then 
anticipated to rise modestly in 2023—as the economy moves into excess 
demand—before returning gradually toward target in 2024.

Strong growth resumed 
The economy is expected to grow by about 4¾ percent in the second half of 
2021, much stronger than the average pace of around 2¼ percent in the first 
half of the year (Table 3 and Chart 4). Consumption is leading the recovery, 
with a rebound in spending on in-person services combining with the already-
elevated level of goods purchases. Spending on air transportation and 
food and accommodation has strengthened considerably in recent months. 
However, supply constraints and lingering cautiousness over the virus have 
been limiting spending and production (Chart 5).

Last observation: September 2021

Housing resales and construction activity remain elevated but have declined 
from historically high levels (Chart 6). This is occurring amid signs that 
the pandemic-related boost in demand for more living space is easing. 
While multiple-unit housing starts have remained relatively robust, single-
family starts have seen a more significant decline since the first quarter. 
Nonetheless, housing markets remain tight, and high disposable incomes 
and low borrowing rates should continue to support solid levels of housing 
activity.

Exports and business investment are expected to rebound through the 
second half of 2021, with foreign demand and business confidence 
strengthening. Shipping bottlenecks and shortages of key inputs are, 
however, pushing up costs and slowing production in the near term. In 
particular, the global shortage of semiconductors continues to weigh on 
motor vehicle production and exports.

Robust job gains as the economy reopens
Job gains have been robust in recent months as in-person services have 
resumed, benefiting many of the workers who suffered earlier in the 
pandemic (Box 4). However, unemployment remains elevated, and many of 
those who are employed are not working as many hours as they were before 
the pandemic.

The abrupt closure and subsequent rapid reopening of the economy in each 
wave of the pandemic have worsened the usual search frictions in the labour 
market. It takes time for workers to find the right job and for employers to find 
workers with the right skills and experience. As a result of these frictions in 
the matching process, the labour market is showing signs of both continued 
slack and acute shortages in some sectors.

Labour market recovery well underway but incomplete
The uneven nature of the COVID-19 shock has 
emphasized how diverse and segmented the labour 
market is—and the need to look at a broad range of 
measures to assess labour market health.

One way to do this is to examine indicators along three 
different dimensions: overall labour market conditions, 
inclusiveness and job characteristics.1 Results from this 
approach indicate that signifi cant progress has been 
made since the depths of the downturn in April 2020, 
though the recovery remains incomplete (Chart 4-A).2
  Overall conditions. In addition to the shortfall in the 

employment rate, the unemployment rate remains more 
than 1 percentage point above pre-pandemic levels.

1  This approach follows that in E. Ens, L. Savoie-Chabot, K. G. See and 

S. L. Wee, “Assessing Labour Market Slack for Monetary Policy,” Bank of 
Canada Staff Discussion Paper No. 2021-15 (October 2021).

2  See the full list of indicators on the Bank’s website.

  Labour market inclusiveness. Groups that 
suffered the greatest job losses—women and 
youth—have experienced an almost complete 
recovery in recent months. This is a welcome 
development because it suggests that much of 
the labour market unevenness introduced by 
the pandemic does not appear to be permanent. 
Nevertheless, signifi cant differences that existed 
across groups before the pandemic remain, 
including the disparity of participation rates between 
men and women.

Moreover, the long-term unemployment rate for 
some groups remains extremely high. Employment 
of workers in low-wage occupations is also further 
behind in its recovery.

  Job characteristics. Despite employment gains, 

wage growth continues to lag, and many workers are 
still not getting the number of hours they would like.

Another way to examine the progress in the labour 
market is to look at the expanded labour market 
indicator (ELMI), a composite indicator that consolidates 
information from a broad range of labour market 
measures.3 The ELMI can assess the level of 

disagreement between indicators on the stage of the 
labour market recovery—with greater disagreement 
suggesting more unevenness. The level of disagreement 
among indicators about the state of the labour market 
has recently decreased, although it remains above 
the pre-pandemic average. This signals that further 
progress is needed to achieve a full recovery.

The labour market has seen a rapid improvement in 
recent months, refl ecting the initial burst of job gains as 
the economy reopened. Additional improvement may 
take more time as the matching process between job 
vacancies and available workers unfolds.

Last observation: 2021Q3

The results of the Bank’s Business Outlook Survey for the third quarter 
of 2021 suggest that labour shortages have intensified (Chart 7). These 
shortages fall into two areas.

The first is the re-emergence of shortages that existed before the pandemic, 
such as for skilled trades and digital-oriented jobs. These shortages are 
consistent with pre-pandemic challenges and could become more severe as 
the recovery unfolds.

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONEtARy POLICy REPORt  •  OCtOBER 2021

CANADIAN ECONOMy  17 

The second relates to businesses that are seeing a large increase in 
demand, including restaurants and retail establishments. Some of these 
shortages should be largely temporary, although it may take time to work 
through these shortages in certain sectors of the economy. Many Canadians 
are still unemployed, and employers can recruit and train workers only so 
quickly. In addition, some workers may be hesitant to return to customer-
facing jobs due to lingering fears of the virus.

Moreover, some who had worked in industries that are rehiring in large 
numbers, such as restaurants, have moved on to other sectors or are 
pursuing further education or training. About one-half of unemployed workers 
who responded to the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations for the 
third quarter of 2021 reported that they were looking to move to a different 
industry. As a result, there is a risk that some of these labour shortages could 
persist.

Wage growth has risen with the rebound in employment but remains 
moderate (Chart 8). Wage gains by industry and occupation are generally at 
or below the average growth rates observed before the pandemic.1 However, 
as labour markets continue to recover and competition for workers picks 
up, there could be increasing pressure to attract and retain staff through 
improved working arrangements, benefits and wages.

Note: LFS stands for the Labour Force Survey; SEPH stands for the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and

part time), job permanency (permanent or temporary), industry of employment and occupation, while the LFS 
principal component measure is based on the estimated common trend of annual growth among these series. 
The National Accounts wage measure is constructed as total wages and salaries at a monthly frequency from 
the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts divided by total hours worked from SEPH.

1  Fluctuations in the number of workers in low-paying jobs during the pandemic have made aggregate 
wage measures more volatile because the composition of employment has shifted. Variable-weight 
measures have fluctuated the most, showing high rates of wage growth when employment in low-wage 
jobs dropped. Wage measures that are less influenced by composition effects, including fixed-weight 
measures, have been more stable.

Supply disruptions weighing on productive capacity
For the economy as a whole, activity is below potential output. The Bank 
typically estimates excess supply for the entire economy. But the assessment 
continues to be more complicated than usual. As a result of pandemic-related 
disruptions, the degree of excess supply and demand varies materially 
across sectors, rendering an aggregate measure of slack less meaningful.

Instead, more sector-specific analysis is needed. For instance, activity in 
hard-to-distance service sectors such as travel and accommodation remains 
below its pre-pandemic levels largely because of weak demand. As such, 
these sectors face considerable slack.

In contrast, as consumers have shifted toward goods and housing, 
expenditures in these sectors have risen far above pre-pandemic levels. For 
example, spending on household appliances and furniture in the second 
quarter was about 20 percent higher than it was at the end of 2019.

This surge in demand for goods and housing is taking place amid global 
supply disruptions, creating excess demand for some goods. These 
supply disruptions include shortages of key intermediate inputs, such 
as semiconductors. The supply disruptions also include transportation 
challenges, such as container shortages and bottlenecks at key ports, which 
are raising shipping costs and delaying deliveries for many goods. In some 
cases, the supply constraints are so severe that production is actually falling 
despite higher prices. This is the case for new motor vehicles. These demand 
and supply factors indicate excess demand clearly remains in these sectors.

Supply has been revised down over the near term because of pandemic-
related disruptions. These negative short-run supply-side effects are 
expected to peak in the fourth quarter and to gradually dissipate over 2022 
(Box 1). Taking these respective demand and supply pressures into account, 
the Bank estimates that the output gap was between -2.25 and -1.25 percent 
in the third quarter. Uncertainty around this range remains particularly 
elevated given the exceptional mix of pandemic-related supply and demand 
factors.

CPI inflation boosted by pandemic-related factors and 
energy prices
CPI inflation was about 4½ percent in September and is expected to rise and 
average around 4¾ percent over the remainder of 2021. Three key factors are 
generating the current strength in prices (Chart 9 and Box 5). First, supply 
constraints are pushing up the prices of goods. Second, prices that had fallen 
last year are continuing to recover with the rebound in demand for hard-to-
distance services. Third, in addition to these pandemic-related factors, higher 
energy prices are expected to contribute about 1⅔⅔ percentage points to total 
inflation in the fourth quarter of 2021.

 
 

Box 5

CANADIAN ECONOMy  19 

Reasons for higher infl ation
Infl ation is above 4 percent and will likely rise to about 
4¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2021.

About one-third of infl ation in the fourth quarter is 
projected to come from higher energy prices. Gasoline 
and natural gas prices are contributing to higher infl ation 
as rising demand and a growing number of severe 
weather events mix with constrained supply in the 
energy sector.1

In addition to elevated energy prices, several supply and 
demand factors related to COVID-19 are also driving this 
increase (see Chart 9).

Supply disruptions pushing up prices for some 
goods
Pandemic-related restrictions and concerns about the 
virus, along with strong policy support, have boosted 
demand for goods and housing. At the same time, 
these sectors have also faced supply constraints. 
These disruptions have pushed up the year-over-year 
increases of specifi c components of the consumer price 
index (CPI). For example:

  Prices for bacon, chicken and shrimp increased by 

20, 10 and 9 percent, respectively.

  Homeowners’ replacement costs rose 14 percent, in 

part due to elevated prices of building materials.

  Motor vehicle prices rose 7 percent because 
semiconductor shortages limited production.

Rebound in demand lift ing prices for in-person 
services
Sectors that had been hit hard by the pandemic have 
also begun contributing to increases in infl ation:

  Airfare has recently increased, refl ecting a 

partial recovery in demand and higher costs.2 
Air transportation prices are well above their 
September 2019 level.

  After sinking to a low not seen since the 1980s, 

prices of traveller accommodations such as 
hotels have somewhat recovered because many 
Canadians resumed summer travel.

In contrast, prices remain weak in sectors still affected 
by soft demand, such as travel tours, with an infl ation 
rate of about -14 percent. Overall, the rebound in 
demand has contributed less than supply constraints to 
CPI infl ation over the past few quarters.

In September 2021, gasoline and natural gas prices were up 33 percent and 
16 percent, respectively.

also due to the reintroduction of certain long-distance fl ights in the calculation 
of this CPI component.

2  The increase in the air transportation prices component in August 2021 was 

Core measures of inflation have also picked up but by less than the CPI. 
While CPI-common has remained below 2 percent, CPI-trim and CPI-median 
have continued to rise (Chart 10). The rebound in demand influences all 
three measures. However, CPI-trim and CPI-median are more affected by 
components experiencing supply constraints, such as motor vehicles. As a 
result, CPI-trim and CPI-median are expected to remain relatively elevated 
over the near term.

Solid growth to continue over the projection horizon 
Growth is expected to be supported by both domestic and foreign demand 
and to become broader and more sustainable over time. The contribution of 
exports and business investment is forecast to increase over the projection. 
Economic growth is projected to moderate from around 5 percent in 2021 to 
around 4¼ percent in 2022 and 3¾ percent in 2023, as the rebound from the 
reopening of the economy and fiscal stimulus fades. 

Global disruptions are expected to reduce supply in Canada in 2021 and 2022 
and to dampen economic activity and demand, with the peak impact occurring 
at the end of 2021 (Box 1). Based on these projections for aggregate demand 
and supply, the Bank forecasts the output gap to close sometime in the middle 
quarters of 2022. However, because the magnitude and persistence of the 
impacts of these supply constraints are uncertain, the timing of the absorption 
of slack is imprecise.

Household spending leading the recovery
Consumption growth is expected to be strong, supported by solid confidence, 
high levels of disposable income and some spending of accumulated savings 
(Chart 11). With continued gains in employment and hours worked, growth in 
labour income should pick up even as government transfers gradually decline.

As the pandemic recedes and confidence rises, spending on hard-to-
distance services is expected to continue to strengthen, while growth in 
demand for goods is projected to moderate. Nonetheless, a degree of 
cautiousness is anticipated to persist. Some consumers may be slower to 
resume normal activities even as the threat of infection gradually diminishes. 
Lingering economic concerns could also prompt some households, 
especially those with lower incomes, to hold onto more of their savings.

Housing market activity is anticipated to remain elevated over 2022 and 2023 
after having moderated from recent record-high levels. Increased immigration, 
solid income levels and favourable financing conditions will support ongoing 
strength. New construction will add to the supply of houses and should help 
soften house price growth.

Foreign demand to drive a solid recovery in exports
Robust foreign demand and elevated commodity prices are expected to 
support strong export growth (Chart 12). Supply chain issues will likely 
continue to weigh on activity but should be largely resolved by the end of 
2022. The drought in Western Canada in summer 2021 is also expected to 
reduce agricultural exports over the next several quarters. The easing of 
these supply disruptions is anticipated to contribute to a continued strong 
recovery in exports later in 2022 and 2023.

Services exports are projected to rebound as international travel approaches 
pre-pandemic levels. However, a full recovery will take time because new 
ways of working and climate initiatives could weigh on areas such as 
business travel.

The relatively high oil and natural gas prices will support energy exports over 
the projection horizon. Existing and planned oil transport capacity, including 
the recent expansion of Enbridge Line 3 as well as the forthcoming Trans 
Mountain Expansion Project, should meet anticipated export growth for 
several years.

Once the supply chain issues and shipping bottlenecks constraining trade 
have dissipated, imports are projected to grow in line with strong domestic 
demand and the expected rebuilding of inventories.

Business investment to strengthen
Investment outside the oil and natural gas sector is anticipated to rise 
as supply disruptions ease, demand increases and business confidence 
improves (Chart 13). The Business Outlook Survey for the third quarter 
of 2021 revealed broad-based strength in investment intentions. The 
accelerating adoption of digitalization and information technologies should 
continue to boost hiring and investment. Although remote work and online 
shopping are reducing demand for office and retail space, the trend toward 
e-commerce should increase investment in logistics and warehouses.

Investment in the oil and natural gas sector is forecast to increase but remain 
below pre-pandemic levels. Despite higher prices, investment is expected 
to remain subdued given elevated uncertainty about both future prices and 
long-term demand.

Inventory investment is expected to contribute to growth over the projection 
horizon as retailers rebuild inventories after unprecedented drawdowns in 
2020 and ongoing delivery delays.

CPI inflation to ease in 2022 to about 2 percent by 
year end
Pandemic-related forces are having a complicated impact on the inflation 
outlook. Supply constraints will push up the level of prices, but the effect 
on the rate of inflation is expected to diminish in 2022 (Chart 14).2 This is 
because the upward pressure on prices will moderate, and inflation rates will 
come down as disruptions to supply gradually fade.

At the same time, the surge in demand for hard-to-distance services is also 
anticipated to moderate, putting less pressure on prices of services. Some 
CPI components, such as airfare, have already regained or surpassed their 
pre-pandemic levels, and further upward pressures are likely to be limited 
as additional capacity comes back online. In addition, the impact of higher 
energy prices is expected to dissipate over 2022. Consequently, CPI inflation 
is expected to ease from about 4¾ percent at the end of 2021 to around 
2 percent at the end of 2022.

Afterward, the degree of excess demand becomes the primary factor 
influencing the projection for inflation. With the economy anticipated to 
move into modest excess demand, inflation is expected to be slightly above 
target in 2023. This is a consequence of Governing Council’s exceptional 
forward guidance to keep the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound 
until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is 
sustainably achieved. Inflation is expected to return again toward the target 
in 2024.

2  Recent evidence suggests that the price increases due to product shortages during the pandemic 

were significant and somewhat persistent, but the inflationary effects were ultimately temporary. See,

Online Micro Data,” Bank of Canada Staff Working Paper No. 2021-52 (October 2021).

Medium- and long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at the 
2 percent target (Chart 15). Both businesses and consumers view price 
pressures as elevated in the near term. A large majority of respondents to 
the Business Outlook Survey for the third quarter of 2021 expect inflation to 
be above 2 percent on average over the next two years. However, a majority 
of firms view the factors pushing up inflation, including energy and supply 
issues, as temporary. The Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations for 
the third quarter of 2021 reported that short-term inflation expectations have 
also risen, in line with actual inflation. Nonetheless, respondents’ 2- and 
5-year-ahead inflation expectations have remained stable.

Private sector forecasters have increased their expectations for inflation two 
years from now. However, their longer-term expectations have remained 
stable. The July 2021 Consensus Economics forecast continues to show 
an average of 2 percent through 2031. In addition, while the 5- and 10-year 
Canadian break-even inflation rates are now somewhat above pre-pandemic 
levels, they are well aligned with the 2 percent inflation target.

Based on the progress of the economic recovery, the Bank adjusted its target 
for purchases through its Government of Canada Bond Purchase Program 
(GBPP) in July 2021 from $3 billion per week to $2 billion per week. Since 
then, the Bank’s ownership of total Government of Canada (GoC) bonds 
outstanding has increased modestly to 46 percent from 44 percent. The 
composition and size of the Bank’s overall balance sheet, however, has 
been roughly stable (Chart 16).3 Most of the shorter-term assets acquired 
at the start of the pandemic matured before the July Report. The remaining 
assets are mainly GoC bonds, which now make up about 85 percent of total 
holdings.

Last observation: October 22, 2021

In this context, the total stock of GoC bonds held on the Bank’s balance 
sheet currently sits at around $425 billion. This includes bonds acquired in 
both the primary market at GoC bond auctions and the secondary market 
through the GBPP. 4 While the proportion has varied over time, around 
30 percent of the current stock of bonds on the Bank’s balance sheet was 
purchased in the primary market and around 70 percent in the secondary 
market.5

Looking ahead, a significant amount of bond holdings will mature in the 
coming years, concentrated in the next one to five years, and these maturities 
will vary month to month (Chart 17).6 Given this combination of large and 
uneven maturities, the Bank’s total holdings of GoC bonds will fluctuate 
modestly over the next few years.

4  The Bank regularly purchases Government of Canada securities at auctions in the primary market. 

Typically, this has been driven by the need to match its balance sheet liabilities, such as bank notes in 
circulation. See T. Macklem, “Economic Progress Report: Monetary Policy for the Recovery,” (speech 
delivered virtually to the Fédération des chambres de commerce du Québec, Montréal, September 9, 
2021).

5  Data on the Bank’s bond holdings can be found on the “Bank of Canada Statement of Financial Position / 

Balance Sheet” on the Bank’s website.

6  The Bank’s holdings broadly reflect the market structure. The weighted average maturity of the Bank’s 

holdings is similar to, but slightly shorter than, that of the market outstanding (6.2 years and 7 years, 
respectively).

RISKS tO tHE INFLAtION OUtLOOK  28 

Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook

Uncertainty around the projection remains unusually high. The outlook 
continues to depend on the evolution of the pandemic, including the spread 
of COVID-19 variants. However, in Canada, the likelihood of a severe 
downturn has diminished with high rates of vaccination. The reopening of the 
economy will nonetheless continue to be a complex process as pervasive 
supply constraints unwind. Households are also adjusting their consumption 
and employment in response to the shifting economic environment. 
Consequently, the evolution of supply and demand and its effects on inflation 
are particularly uncertain.

Some of the risks identified in previous reports have been partially 
incorporated into the projection. The base-case scenario now includes slower 
housing market activity over the near term and longer-lasting effects on 
inflation from supply-side disruptions.

The outlook for inflation remains subject to several upside and downside 
risks. The Bank views the risks to the outlook for inflation to be roughly 
balanced around its updated projection. However, with inflation above the 
top of the Bank’s inflation-control range and expected to stay there for 
some time, the upside risks are of greater concern. While the Bank views 
elevated inflation as transitory, the realization of additional upside risks 
or unanticipated persistence of existing pressures could lead to a rise in 
inflation expectations along with more pervasive labour cost and inflationary 
pressures. The risk is that these effects begin to feed into embedded 
inflation.

Drawing from a larger set of risks that were considered, this section presents 
a selection of those identified as most important for the projected path of 
inflation.

(i)  More persistent effects of the pandemic (↓)

The effects of the pandemic may be more severe and persistent than 
assumed in the projection. Some evidence shows that the immunity 
provided by vaccines may be waning more quickly than previously 
anticipated, increasing the potential for new waves of the pandemic. 
The spread of the Delta and other possible future variants may prolong 
the ongoing softness in demand for hard-to-distance services. This 
may dampen the rebound in confidence, resulting in lower spending 
and lower inflationary pressures. 

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONEtARy POLICy REPORt  •  OCtOBER 2021

RISKS tO tHE INFLAtION OUtLOOK  29 

(ii)  Stronger household spending in Canada (↑)

The projection continues to include some degree of caution around 
consumption. However, progress in vaccinations and reduced 
pandemic-related uncertainty could boost confidence by more than 
expected. As well, households could spend more of their accumulated 
savings or accelerate their spending. Consumption and residential 
investment would then be stronger than projected and would contribute 
to greater inflationary pressures.

(iii)  More persistent supply bottlenecks and cost pressures (↑)
Supply bottlenecks and cost pressures could lead to more persistent 
inflationary pressures and a slower economic recovery than what 
is embedded in the base case. At the same time, energy supply 
shortages in other countries could put further pressure on supply 
chains as manufacturing production is disrupted. These disruptions to 
business operations may also lead firms to adjust their supply chains in 
ways that could increase costs. More persistent labour shortages could 
also result in higher wage pressures.

(iv)  weaker Canadian exports (↓)

The risks around exports remain tilted to the downside. Competitiveness 
challenges and Buy American provisions could mute the benefits of 
expected increases in foreign demand. More persistent or severe supply 
disruptions may further dampen exports. As well, China’s economy could 
weaken further, notably in response to stress in the property sector and 
regulatory changes in other key sectors. This would pull down global 
commodity prices and Canadian exports.

(v)  Sharp tightening of global financial conditions (↓)

With high levels of global indebtedness, increased inflationary 
pressures, reduced policy support and elevated equity valuations, 
a pullback in risk appetite could trigger a sharp tightening of global 
financial conditions. This would constrain access to credit for 
vulnerable EMEs or other highly indebted borrowers and dampen 
global demand.

Canada’s infl ation-control strategy
Canada’s infl ation-control strategy1
Infl ation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote the 

economic and fi nancial well-being of Canadians.

  Canada’s experience with infl ation targeting since 1991 has shown 
that the best way to foster confi dence in the value of money and to 
contribute to sustained economic growth, employment gains and 
improved living standards is by keeping infl ation low, stable and 
predictable.

 

In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 
Canada’s infl ation-control target for a further fi ve-year period, ending 
December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the rate of infl ation 
of the consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 percent midpoint 
of the control range of 1 to 3 percent.

Monetary policy tools
  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight 

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent 

communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the 
economy and infl ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on 
eight pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s 
outlook are published four times each year in the Monetary Policy 
Report.

Infl ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible
  Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means 
that the Bank is equally concerned about infl ation rising above or 
falling below the 2 percent target.

  Canada’s infl ation-targeting framework is ﬂ exible. Typically, the 

Bank seeks to return infl ation to target over a horizon of six to eight 
quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning 
infl ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence 
of the shocks buffeting the economy.

quarters—to work their way through the economy and have their 
full effect on infl ation. For this reason, monetary policy must be 
forward-looking.

Monitoring infl ation
 

  The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes in 

the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate).2 The Bank 
also has a range of other monetary policy tools it can use when the 
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on 
the future evolution of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases 
(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures, 
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these 
additional tools would depend on the economic and fi nancial market 
context.

  All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for 

Canadian goods and services through their infl uence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The 
balance between this demand and the economy’s production 
capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl ation 
pressures in the economy.

In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in 
indirect taxes such as the goods and services tax/harmonized sales 
tax, can cause sizable fl uctuations in CPI infl ation.

 

In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such 
transitory movements in CPI infl ation and focuses on a set of “core” 
infl ation measures that better refl ect the underlying trend of infl ation. 
In this sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the 
Bank achieve the CPI infl ation target. They are not a replacement for 
CPI infl ation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl ation are CPI-trim, 
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given 
month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which corresponds to 
the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket 
weight) of the distribution of price changes; and CPI-common, which 
uses a statistical procedure to track common price changes across 
categories in the CPI basket.

Inﬂ ation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

Overview
Overview

The economic recovery in Canada and other major economies has 
progressed despite recent waves of COVID-19. The recovery is expected 
to strengthen as the pandemic and related restrictions ease. The rollout of 
vaccinations is proceeding rapidly in many regions, increasing confidence 
in the durability of the recovery (Chart 1, Box 1). Widespread immunity will, 
however, take longer to achieve in emerging-market economies (EMEs). 
Against this backdrop, the health and economic implications of variants are 
an important and growing source of uncertainty for the global economy.

Key messages
  In Canada, although economic growth in the first half of this year was 

weaker than estimated, it should pick up strongly in the third quarter as 
the economy reopens. Consumption is expected to lead the rebound 
with increases in spending on transportation, recreation, and food and 
accommodation services. The economic recovery is expected to become 
more broad-based and self-sustaining over the projection horizon.  

  The impact of the pandemic remains uneven, and achieving a full and 

inclusive recovery will take time. Fiscal and monetary policy are providing 
a strong foundation to support the ongoing economic recuperation.

  Many sources of uncertainty surround the medium-term outlook for gross 

domestic product (GDP) and potential output. As a result, estimates of 
when the output gap will close are particularly uncertain. In the projection, 
economic slack is absorbed in the second half of 2022.

  Consumer price index (CPI) inflation is expected to remain elevated 
throughout the rest of 2021 due to temporary factors related to the 
pandemic. As these effects dissipate later this year and in 2022, inflation 
is forecast to ease to about 2 percent. Inflation is then projected to rise to 
slightly above 2 percent before returning toward target in 2024.

 
 

Box 1

Key inputs to the projection 
The Bank of Canada’s projection is always conditional 
on several key assumptions, and changes to them will 
affect the outlook for the Canadian economy. The Bank 
regularly reviews these assumptions and assesses the 
sensitivity of the economic projection to them. The key 
inputs into the Bank’s projection are as follows:

  The global vaccination rollout is progressing in many 
regions, albeit at a slightly slower pace in the United 
States than had been anticipated. Broad immunity is 
assumed to be achieved in the third quarter of 2021 
in Canada; later in 2021 in the United States, most 
other advanced economies and China; and in 2022 
in other emerging-market economies. 

  Most public health restrictions in Canada, apart 

from some border restrictions, are assumed to be 
eased by the end of the third quarter of 2021. As in 
the April Report, the Bank assumes consumers will 
become somewhat less cautious over the latter part 
of the year. Nonetheless, the Bank assumes some 
caution among consumers will remain over the rest 
of the projection horizon.

  The projection incorporates $108 billion in federal 
fi scal stimulus, in line with the 2021 federal budget.

  Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent levels. 

The per-barrel prices in US dollars are assumed to 
be $75 for Brent, $70 for West Texas Intermediate 
and $60 for Western Canadian Select, each about 
$10 higher than assumed in the April Report. 

  By convention, the Bank does not forecast the 

exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. The 
Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at 81 cents 
US over the projection horizon, close to its recent 
average and only slightly above the 80 cents US 
assumed in April.

  The pandemic and related containment measures 

have both persistent and temporary negative effects 
on the supply side of the Canadian economy.1
  The Bank’s assessment of the growth of 

potential output, a longer-term concept, looks 
through the short-lived effects of containment

OvERvIEw  3 

measures. Potential output growth is assumed 
to average about 1.8 percent per year over 
2021–23, approximately 0.2 percentage points 
higher than estimated in April. This change 
refl ects stronger expected investment and less 
labour market scarring. As a result, the level of 
potential output in 2023 is projected to be about 
0.4 percent below the pre-pandemic estimate.2

  Containment measures have been causing 
important short-term effects on the supply of 
goods and services. In particular, supply fell 
sharply in early 2020 when some businesses 
were forced to temporarily suspend or reduce 
operations, but it has since largely recovered. 
The projection assumes that containment 
measures have no effects on supply starting in 
the third quarter of 2021.

  Estimates of supply can be obtained by 

combining the estimates of the temporary 
effects of the containment measures with the 
assessment of potential output. 

  The Bank estimates that the output gap—the 

difference between gross domestic product and 
supply—was about -3.0 to -2.0 percent in the 
second quarter of 2021, unchanged from the range 
reported for the fi rst quarter in the April Report. 

  The neutral nominal policy rate is defi ned as the real 

rate consistent with output remaining sustainably 
at its potential and with infl ation at target, on an 
ongoing basis, plus 2 percent for infl ation. It is a 
medium- to long-term equilibrium concept. For 
Canada, the economic projection is based on an 
assumption that the neutral rate is at the midpoint 
of the estimated range of 1.75 to 2.75 percent. This 
range was last reassessed in the April Report. 

1  As in the previous four reports, the Bank makes the distinction between 
supply and potential output in the near term to account for the relatively 
short-lived nature of some of the decrease in supply caused by containment 
measures.

2  Estimates of the level of potential output in 2023 were not constructed as part 

of the January 2020 projection. The pre-pandemic estimate referred to in 
the text is calculated by extending the January 2020 projection for potential 
output by two years, i.e., through 2023, using the estimate for potential 
growth in 2021 that was provided in the January 2020 Report.

After some weakness in the first quarter, the global economic recovery 
from the COVID-19 pandemic is strengthening. The recovery, however, will 
likely continue to be uneven across countries and sectors. In advanced 
economies, recoveries are on a more solid footing than they are in EMEs, 
reflecting elevated vaccination rates and greater policy support. Growth is 
particularly strong in the United States, where substantial fiscal stimulus was 
implemented in the first half of 2021 and the economy is more advanced in its 
reopening phase than economies of other countries.  

Demand for goods—which has bolstered manufacturing and trade—
continues to support global growth. Meanwhile, the easing of containment 
measures in advanced economies is leading to improved spending on 
services (Chart 2). However, supply shortages and bottlenecks have 
contributed to rising input costs and have restrained manufacturing 
production in recent months (Chart 3).

After a contraction of 2.4 percent in 2020, global growth is expected to 
surge to about 7 percent in 2021, reflecting less drag from pandemic-related 
restrictions and support from both monetary and fiscal policy (Table 1). 
Following the initial rebound of the economy, global growth is expected to 
moderate in 2022 and 2023 as effects of policy stimulus on growth fade. 
The outlook for global GDP growth has been revised up modestly relative 
to the April Report (Box 2). However, the emergence of new variants of the 
COVID-19 virus continues to add uncertainty into the outlook.

Inflation has been rising in most regions and exceeded targeted rates in some 
countries, including the United States. Transitory factors are largely driving 
this increase. Surging demand amid supply constraints has pushed up some 
input costs. Most notably, commodity prices have increased, raising energy 
prices and other costs. The prices of some goods and services that fell at the 
beginning of the pandemic have started rising in some regions, contributing to 
the increase in global inflation. Nevertheless, inflation expectations remain well 
anchored in advanced economies and many EMEs. 

Box 2

Changes to the economic projection since the April Report
Global GDP outlook
The global outlook for gross domestic product (GDP) 
has been revised up since April. The level of global GDP 
is expected to be 0.3 percent higher by the end of 2023. 
Two factors explain most of this revision:

The forecast for Canadian GDP is stronger in 

Chart 2-A: 
2022 and 2023 than forecast in the April Report
Seasonally adjusted at annual rates, chained 2012 dollars, quarterly data

  The Bank now assumes that, over the projection 

horizon, households in advanced economies 
will spend some of the excess savings that they 
accumulated during the pandemic.

  The base-case scenario incorporates about 

US$1.5 trillion in new US government spending 
over eight years starting in 2022. This accounts 
for the recent Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework 
agreement and for additional spending on research 
and development. US government spending could 
be higher if other spending proposals are also 
approved.

Canadian GDP outlook
While GDP in Canada has been revised down over 
2021, it subsequently rises to above that projected in 
the April Report (Chart 2-A). GDP growth has been 
revised down by about half a percentage point in 
2021, to around 6 percent. It has been revised up by 
about 1 percentage point in 2022 and remains roughly 
unchanged in 2023 (Table 2). As a result, the level of 
real GDP is about ¾ percent higher by the end of both 
2022 and 2023.

  The forecast for GDP growth in the third quarter has 

been revised up slightly. Consumption is expected 
to be stronger, refl ecting increased consumer 
confi dence as the reopening of the economy takes 
hold.

  Two key factors contribute to higher projected 

domestic demand over 2022 and 2023:

20 percent of the extra savings they 
have accumulated during the pandemic

April Report, none of these extra savings went 
to consumption). This change was made in 
response to new survey data, including the 
Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations for 
the second quarter of 2021, where consumers 
report planning to spend some of these savings 
over the next two years.

  With improved business confi dence and the 

higher terms of trade, the projections for 
investment and consumption have been revised 
up compared with the April forecast.

Canadian CPI infl ation outlook
Consumer price index (CPI) infl ation is expected to be 
higher than projected in April. CPI infl ation has been 
revised up by 0.7 percentage points in 2021 and by 
0.5 percentage points in 2022. These positive revisions 
largely refl ect the effects of higher gasoline prices, 
stronger expected effects of supply disruptions for 
prices of some goods, and a faster partial recovery in 
prices for hard-to-distance services.

Accommodative global financial conditions  
In advanced economies, financial conditions continue to support economic 
activity, and financial markets have modestly pulled forward their 
expectations of when monetary policy will be tightened. Yields on 10-year 
government bonds have declined by about 20 basis points since the April 
Report and are low by historical standards. In addition, corporate bond 
spreads remain tight, and equity price indexes are generally higher than at 
the time of the April Report. 

Financial conditions also remain accommodative in many EMEs, as indicated 
by narrow spreads on the emerging-market bond index. The unevenness 
of the recovery could, however, pose significant financial challenges to 
vulnerable EMEs when advanced economies begin to withdraw monetary 
stimulus. 

Since the April Report, higher energy prices have contributed to a modest 
appreciation of the Canadian dollar against most currencies other than the 
US dollar (Chart 4). The broad US dollar index also appreciated in recent 
weeks.

Rapid growth in the United States 
In the United States, growth of both GDP and employment are estimated 
to have been strong in the first half of 2021. Industrial production remained 
resilient despite bottlenecks at ports and global shortages of semiconductors. 
The Bank estimates that GDP surpassed its pre-pandemic level in the 
second quarter, though about 7 million jobs remain to be recovered.1 

1  Given population growth, roughly 8 million jobs would be needed to reach the pre-pandemic employment 

rate.

GDP growth is projected to surge to 6½ percent in 2021, supported by strong 
consumer spending. Substantial transfers to households have helped push 
consumption of goods well above pre-pandemic levels. As the economy 
reopens, consumption should shift back toward services. In addition, some 
of the extra savings accumulated during the pandemic are now assumed 
to boost consumption, starting near the end of the year. Moreover, strong 
demand should support solid growth in business investment. After growing 
at a robust pace through the first quarter of 2021, residential investment is 
expected to contract modestly mid-year. The inventory of homes to sell is 
limited, and high material costs are holding back new housing construction.    

The projection assumes approval of new government spending totalling 
about US$1.5 trillion over eight years starting in 2022 (Box 2). Despite these 
new expenditures, GDP growth is expected to slow in 2022 and 2023 as the 
effects of other recently adopted stimulus packages wane.

Both core and total inflation as measured by personal consumption 
expenditure price indexes rose above 3 percent in recent months. The 
increase in core inflation largely reflects a surge in demand due to strong 
fiscal support and supply shortages that caused temporary production 
shortfalls for certain goods, such as motor vehicles. The reopening of the 
economy also led to a recovery in prices in some hard-to-distance service 
sectors, where containment measures had previously led to price reductions. 
Rising energy prices also boosted total inflation. Inflation is expected to 
decrease over the next year as the effects of these factors dissipate, but it is 
forecast to remain above 2 percent over the projection horizon. 

Growth resuming in the euro area
GDP growth is estimated to have turned positive in the euro area in the 
second quarter as businesses started to reopen. Growth is expected to 
accelerate further in the second half of the year and to remain strong in 2022 
with the broadening of the reopening phase. Growth should slow in 2023 as 
the effects of fiscal stimulus begin to fade. 

Total inflation in the euro area has increased in recent months, due largely 
to transitory factors, and is expected to peak in the second half of 2021. 
Core inflation, however, remains below target as the euro area continues to 
operate well below its capacity. Over the projection horizon, core inflation 
should gradually increase as economic activity recovers.

Growth to rebound in China after a slow start in 2021 
Growth in China slowed in the first quarter in response to COVID-19 
containment measures. Manufacturing production and exports continue 
to underpin economic activity. Household spending and growth in 
services remain modest. Policy is adjusting as conditions evolve. Ongoing 
vaccinations should facilitate a gradual increase in demand for services over 
the remainder of the year. As conditions improve, policy support is expected 
to be gradually withdrawn, leading to slowing growth over the projection 
horizon. While producer prices for some goods have risen sharply, consumer 
price inflation remains low.

Growth restrained in emerging-market economies
The emergence of new variants of the COVID-19 virus has led to new 
outbreaks and high daily case numbers in many oil-importing EMEs since 
March. This prompted new restrictions that likely impeded growth in the 
second quarter, particularly in India. As case numbers fall and restrictions 
are eased, a recovery is expected in the second half of the year, though 
the spread of new variants is a risk. Growth is then projected to slow in 
2022 and 2023, when the initial rebound effects will have faded. The 
slow vaccination rollout is nevertheless expected to restrain the recovery 
through 2023, given the elevated risks of additional outbreaks and renewed 
restrictions. 

In the rest-of-world group, growth is projected to be strong, reflecting robust 
vaccination rollouts—particularly in the advanced economies—and the 
associated easing of restrictions on mobility. The increase in oil prices since 
the start of the year has also supported economic activity in the oil-exporting 
members of this group.

Higher oil prices
Demand for oil has outpaced supply in recent months, pushing oil inventories 
down to typical pre-pandemic levels (Chart 5). The prices of Brent, West 
Texas Intermediate and Western Canadian Select oil have risen and are 
assumed to be US$75, US$70 and US$60, respectively, each US$10 higher 
than in the April Report (Box 1). 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some 
non-OPEC oil producers (OPEC+) expanded production modestly from May 
to July. The group has discussed further quota increases but has not yet 
reached an agreement. Even with some expansion of OPEC+ production,

the ongoing reopening of major economies could lift prices above assumed 
levels in the near term. Subsequently, a large rise in OPEC+ production or 
a greater-than-expected increase in US production could more than reverse 
such gains.  

The Bank’s non-energy commodity price index is close to its level at the 
time of the April Report and higher than it was before the pandemic. Prices 
for base metals and agricultural products have moved up modestly since 
the April Report. While lumber prices increased sharply between late April 
and mid-May, they have since returned to below their level at the time of the 
April Report because housing-related pressures eased. Markets expect non-
energy commodity prices to remain elevated over the projection horizon due 
to strong global demand.

In Canada, the rapid rollout of vaccinations is improving prospects for a 
sustainable recovery. The third wave of COVID-19 slowed economic growth 
and led to reductions in employment in April and May 2021. However, these 
negative effects are waning, and the downside risks associated with the 
pandemic have significantly diminished. Broader immunity, fewer COVID-19 
cases and the resulting easing of restrictions are expected to lead to a strong 
pickup in GDP growth over the second half of 2021.

Achieving a full and inclusive economic recovery will, however, take time. 
Hard-to-distance service sectors face an uncertain reopening process. They 
may encounter difficulties rehiring workers quickly as well as supply chain 
issues. And they may experience uncertainty about the strength of demand 
as well as concerns about the possibility of future restrictions. Over the 
coming months, the labour market should continue to see a strong rebound 
in employment. However, the process of matching workers and jobs could be 
challenging and cause delays. As well, structural changes to the economy 
may mean that some people face long spells of unemployment.

While this adjustment process could be lengthy and uneven, broader 
COVID-19 immunity should reduce uncertainty and cautiousness. In turn, this 
will boost consumption and business investment. Similar developments in our 
trading partners’ economies should underpin the recovery in exports. While 
fiscal and monetary policies are supporting economic activity, the recovery is 
expected to become broader and more self-sustaining over time.

Economic activity in the first half of 2021 has been somewhat less robust 
than anticipated because a combination of softer housing activity, supply 
chain issues and the impact of containment weighed more on growth than 
expected. However, throughout the rest of the projection horizon, economic 
growth is expected to be stronger than noted in the April Report (Box 2). The 
economy is projected to grow at a robust pace of around 6 percent in 2021. 
Growth then moderates to about 4½ and 3¼ percent—still solid paces—in 
2022 and 2023, respectively (Table 2).
Many sources of uncertainty surround the medium-term outlook for GDP 
and potential output. These include the difficult adjustments in the labour 
market, the productivity benefits of digital investments and the persistence 
of changes in consumer behaviour. Because these factors are relevant for 
both demand and supply, estimates of when the output gap will close are 
particularly uncertain.

CPI inflation will likely remain at or above 3 percent through the rest of 2021 
due to temporary factors related to the pandemic. As the effects of these 
factors dissipate later this year and in 2022, inflation is expected to ease to 
about 2 percent. Inflation is then projected to rise temporarily—to modestly 
above 2 percent in 2023—before returning toward target in 2024.

Economic activity to rebound with reopening
Economic growth should pick up strongly in the third quarter of 2021 
(Chart 6, Table 3). Consumer confidence has returned to pre-pandemic 
levels, and a high share of the eligible population is vaccinated. As the 
economy reopens, consumption is expected to lead the rebound with an 
increase in spending on services such as transportation, recreation, and food 
and accommodation (Chart 7).

Housing resales have moderated from historically high levels but remain 
elevated (Chart 8). Other areas of housing activity—such as new construction 
and renovation—remain strong, supported by high disposable incomes, low 
borrowing rates and the pandemic-related desire for more living space.

Strong growth in foreign demand and higher commodity prices should 
contribute to a solid pickup in exports and business investment. Broad-
based improvements in business confidence should also provide support 
(Chart 9). The adverse effects of the global shortage of semiconductors on 
motor vehicle exports are expected to ease over the second half of this year. 
However, supply chain disruptions and shipping issues are assumed to weigh 
on exports more broadly into 2022.

Significant labour market slack
Despite a sizable recuperation of jobs in June, the employment rate remains 
1.7 percentage points below where it was in February 2020. Given population 
growth, roughly 550,000 people would need to be hired just to reach the 
pre-pandemic employment rate. Moreover, the total amount of hours worked 
in June was roughly 4 percent below the pre-pandemic level. Job gains in 
June were particularly strong for women and young people. Nevertheless, 
for some groups of workers, employment rates are still much lower than 
their pre-pandemic levels (Chart 10). In particular, employment of low-wage 
workers is far from fully recovered. 

The share of those unemployed for 52 weeks or longer is at the highest 
level since the series began. In the past, lengthier spells of unemployment 
increased the risk that workers would leave the labour force or see their skills 
erode. However, the uniqueness of the pandemic may mean that the length 
of time unemployed is a less reliable indicator of scarring risks. The workers 
most affected by the pandemic—namely, young people and workers with 
fewer skills—may face less risk of skills erosion. In addition, young people 
may be able to adjust more easily by obtaining further education or training.2

Large increases in jobs are expected to continue over the summer months. 
This should help further reduce employment gaps across job types and 
worker groups. However, it could take businesses some time to find workers 
with the right skills to fill jobs. In addition, firms with large hiring needs may 
have trouble bringing new workers on board quickly. Meanwhile, many 
workers may face challenges shifting to growing sectors and retraining to 
acquire new skills.

the hardest-hit sectors transitioned to school during the pandemic than during the previous decade.

(permanent or temporary), industry of employment and occupation.

Last observation: June 2021

Indicators from the summer 2021 Business Outlook Survey continue to 
suggest that slack is uneven across sectors. Businesses facing strong 
demand, such as those tied to consumer goods, housing or e-commerce, 
frequently point to tighter labour market conditions.

Measures of wage inflation remain subdued (Chart 11). Swings in the number 
of workers in low-paying jobs during the pandemic have been making these 
measures volatile. Variable-weight measures have fluctuated the most, with 
high rates of wage growth when employment in low-wage jobs dropped. 
Wage measures that are less influenced by such composition effects, 
including fixed-weight measures, have been more stable.

For the economy as a whole, excess supply remains prevalent. The Bank 
estimates that the output gap was between -3.0 and -2.0 percent in the 
second quarter (Box 1). A range for the output gap of one percentage point 
has been reported in the Monetary Policy Report for some time. This range 
may understate overall uncertainty surrounding the output gap, and this 
is particularly true now because of the exceptional circumstances of the 
pandemic.

CPI inflation boosted by temporary factors
CPI inflation has increased in recent months and is expected to remain at or 
above 3 percent for the remainder of 2021. Three sets of factors are leading 
to this temporary strength (Chart 12). First, gasoline prices have risen from 
very low levels a year ago and are above their pre-pandemic levels, lifting 
inflation. Second, other prices that had fallen last year with plummeting 
demand are now recovering with the reopening of the economy and the 
release of pent-up demand. Third, supply constraints, including shipping 
bottlenecks and the global shortage of semiconductors, are pushing up the 
prices of goods such as motor vehicles.3 

3  Respondents to the summer 2021 Business Outlook Survey reported cost pressures associated with 
supply chain issues, notably rising shipping and freight fees. They expect these cost pressures to be 
temporary.

Core measures of inflation have picked up in recent months, likely reflecting 
some of the same temporary issues driving movements in CPI inflation. 
CPI-common remains below 2 percent, while CPI-median and CPI-trim have 
moved above 2 percent. Despite recent increases in inflation, long-term 
inflation expectations have remained stable (Chart 13).

Solid growth after a strong rebound in 2021
Following a strong recovery led by household spending in 2021, economic 
growth is projected to ease over 2022 and 2023 while remaining higher than 
potential output growth (Table 2). In the projection, the output gap closes 
and labour market slack is absorbed in the second half of 2022. This forecast 
is sensitive to the uncertain evolution of demand and difficulties related to 
supply, including those associated with reopening as well as with long-term 
structural adjustments.

The recovery in demand is expected to become more broad-based and self-
sustaining over time. The level of residential investment is anticipated to 
decline from historical highs, and the growth of government spending should 
slow. Meanwhile, business investment and export growth will likely pick up. 
Robust business investment and higher immigration should help strengthen 
potential output growth over the projection horizon.

Consumption to underpin the recovery
With households expected to be less cautious and assumed to spend 
20 percent of the extra savings they accumulated during the pandemic, 
consumption growth is projected to be strong. As the labour market recovers, 
growth in labour income should pick up even as government transfers 
gradually decline.

A degree of cautiousness is nonetheless anticipated to persist. Some 
consumers may be slower to resume normal activities because of lingering 
fears of contracting COVID-19. Other households, particularly those with low 
incomes, are expected to hold extra savings because of economic concerns 
(Chart 14).

Housing activity is anticipated to remain higher than it was before the 
pandemic even as it declines from its recent record-high levels. The recovery 
in employment, increasing population growth and elevated savings support 
the projection for housing demand. The boost from the pandemic-induced 
increase in demand for larger homes should ease gradually over the 
projection horizon.

Strong housing demand amid limited supply has contributed to rising house 
prices over the past year. However, a rebalancing of supply and demand is 
expected to lead to a moderation in house price growth over the projection 
horizon.4 As the recovery progresses, new construction will add to the supply 
of houses, particularly in high-demand areas outside of city centres.5 And 
with high vaccination rates, households may be more comfortable showing 
their homes to potential buyers. The resulting increases in supply, along with 
some softening of demand, should improve the balance in housing markets.

Foreign demand to support export recovery
The strong US recovery is expected to support robust export growth over the 
projection horizon (Chart 15). The growth of goods exports should benefit 
from strengthening foreign demand and higher prices for a wide range of 
commodities. However, motor vehicle exports will likely remain below pre-
pandemic levels as some manufacturers adjust their production in response 
to changes in US consumer preferences and the industry movement toward 
producing more electric and hybrid vehicles.

introduced a fixed floor to the minimum qualifying rate for uninsured mortgages. This should help prevent 
homebuyers from overstretching and, in turn, contribute to a moderation in house price growth.

Services exports should rebound from weak levels as travel restrictions are 
gradually lifted. A full recovery will take time given weakness in components 
such as business travel.

The relatively high level of oil prices is expected to support growth in energy 
exports over the projection horizon. Existing pipeline and rail transportation 
capacity, as well as forthcoming pipeline expansions, should provide 
sufficient capacity for export volumes to expand over the next few years.

Imports are projected to grow in line with strong domestic demand. Retailers 
should contribute to the strength of imports in upcoming quarters as they 
replenish their inventories. The relatively high level of the Canadian dollar 
makes imports more affordable and Canadian products less competitive in 
both domestic and export markets.

Business investment to strengthen
As domestic and foreign demand increase and business confidence 
improves, investment outside the oil and gas sector is expected to pick up 
in 2021. It should keep strengthening over 2022 and 2023 (Chart 16). The 
summer 2021 Business Outlook Survey revealed broad-based strength in 
investment intentions. Moreover, widespread adoption of digitalization and 
information technologies—often accelerated in response to the pandemic—
should continue to boost hiring and investment (Chart 17). While increased 
remote work and online shopping are reducing demand for office and 
retail space, the trend toward e-commerce should strengthen investment 
in logistics and warehouses. Measures in the latest federal budget should 
further boost public and private investment.

Last observation: June 23, 2021

Investment in the oil and gas sector is expected to remain below its pre-
pandemic level throughout the projection horizon. Capital spending plans 
are relatively modest despite the recent rise in prices for oil and natural gas. 
Businesses may be hesitant to increase investment in an environment where 
long-term transportation capacity is uncertain and may be limited. Moreover, 
the desire to reduce leverage, uncertainty about future demand for oil and a 
heightened focus on climate change will continue to challenge the sector.

Inventory investment is projected to rise and contribute to real GDP growth 
throughout the projection as businesses rebuild their low inventories after 
unprecedented drawdowns in 2020.

CPI inflation to ease as temporary factors fade
Over 2020 and 2021, inflation dynamics are heavily influenced by imbalances 
in supply and demand across certain goods and hard-to-distance services. 
Because reopening and structural change are complex processes, the 
implications for imbalances between supply and demand are hard to predict.

CPI inflation is expected to ease by the start of 2022 as the temporary factors 
related to the pandemic fade (Chart 18). Economic slack becomes the 
primary factor influencing the projection for inflation dynamics thereafter.

The uncertainty around the outlook for the output gap and inflation remains 
high. Because of this, the estimated timing for when slack is absorbed is 
highly imprecise. In the projection, this occurs sometime in the second half of 
2022.

After declining to 2 percent during 2022, inflation is expected to rise modestly 
in 2023 as the economy moves into excess demand. The excess demand 
and resultant increase in inflation to above target are expected to be

temporary. They are a consequence of Governing Council’s commitment to 
keep the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack 
is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. 
Inflation is expected to return toward the target in 2024.

The projection is consistent with medium- and long-term inflation 
expectations remaining well-anchored at the 2 percent target. Both 
businesses and consumers view price pressures as elevated in the near 
term. A large majority of respondents to the summer 2021 Business Outlook 
Survey now expect inflation to be above 2 percent on average over the next 
two years. Nonetheless, firms view higher commodity prices, supply chain 
bottlenecks, policy stimulus and the release of pent-up demand as largely 
temporary factors boosting inflation higher in the near term. 

The Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations for the second quarter of 
2021 reported that short-term inflation expectations have risen as well, in line 
with recent increases in prices. However, respondents’ long-term inflation 
expectations have not increased. The April 2021 Consensus Economics 
forecast for long-term inflation expectations shows an average of 2 percent 
through 2031. In addition, the 10-year Canadian break-even inflation rate, 
which provides a signal about the expected long-term path of inflation, has 
remained close to 2 percent in recent months (Chart 13).

balance sheet

Several of the balance sheet tools used by the Bank at the onset of the 
pandemic to support market liquidity were wound down or allowed to expire 
on schedule once market functioning had improved. The remaining liquidity 
support and market functioning programs have ended since the April Report.6 
However, the Government of Canada Bond Purchase Program (GBPP)—the 
Bank’s quantitative easing (QE) program—continues to provide monetary 
policy stimulus to support the economic recovery. In April 2021, given the 
progress of the recovery, the Bank adjusted the pace of weekly GBPP 
purchases from a minimum of $4 billion to a target of $3 billion.7 

The GBPP targets a weekly value of gross bond purchases. The target does 
not vary with the value of bonds maturing in any given week. To date, around 
$18 billion of Government of Canada (GoC) bonds purchased under the QE 
program have matured and rolled off the Bank’s balance sheet (Chart 19). 
Because the value of maturities has been relatively low so far, the average

difference between total weekly purchases (i.e., gross purchases) and weekly 
purchases minus maturities (i.e., net purchases) has been small. But the 
value of maturing bonds will pick up. This is important to note because the 
GBPP adds monetary policy stimulus through its net purchases.

In this context, the composition and size of the Bank’s balance sheet 
have continued to evolve (Chart 20). The total stock of GoC bonds on the 
Bank’s balance sheet is around $400 billion, or more than 80 percent of 
total assets.8 The Bank’s total ownership of GoC bonds outstanding has 
increased to 44 percent of the overall amount outstanding, from 42 percent 
in April. However, the impact of this increase on the size of the balance sheet 
was more than offset by the maturing of a sizable amount of shorter-term 
assets—notably extended term repurchase agreements. After peaking at 
$575 billion in mid-March 2021, the value of total assets has decreased to 
just under $485 billion. As the total value of assets declined, so did the level 
of settlement balances, which now sits at roughly $260 billion.

Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook

Uncertainty around the projection remains unusually high. The outlook still 
depends on the evolution of the pandemic, including the spread of COVID-19 
variants. However, in Canada, downside tail risks have diminished with 
high rates of vaccination. The reopening of the economy will be a complex 
process, and the responses of consumers to new spending options will be 
difficult to predict. As a result, the size and persistence of any imbalances 
between supply and demand as well as the effects of these imbalances on 
inflation are particularly uncertain.

Some of the risks identified in previous reports have been partially 
incorporated into the projection. The base-case scenario now includes 
additional US fiscal stimulus, more robust consumption in Canada and other 
advanced economies, stronger potential output in Canada and greater cost 
pressures.

The outlook for inflation remains subject to several upside and downside 
risks. Drawing from a larger set of risks that were considered, this section 
presents a selection of risks identified as the most important ones for the 
projected path of inflation. The Bank views these risks as roughly balanced.

(i)  Another wave of infections (↓)

The base-case projection assumes continued low-level transmission 
of the virus along with possible flare-ups. However, the spread of more 
contagious variants could trigger a stronger resurgence of infections. 
This in turn could lead to the reimposition of containment measures, 
dampen consumer and business confidence, and delay the rebound in 
hard-to-distance service sectors.

(ii)  Stronger household spending in Canada (↑)

Progress in vaccinations and reduced pandemic-related uncertainty 
could boost confidence by more than expected. As a result, 
households could spend more of their accumulated savings or increase 
their spending faster than assumed in the base-case projection. 
Consumption and residential investment would then be stronger than 
projected and contribute to greater inflationary pressures.

(iii)  More persistent supply bottlenecks and cost pressures (↑)
Businesses are facing higher costs for shipping and for inputs affected 
by delivery delays, as well as higher commodity prices. Disruptions 
to business operations brought about by the pandemic could also 
increase costs, as could adjustments during the reopening of the 
economy. The potential impacts on inflation are highly uncertain. 

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONEtARy POlICy REPORt  •  JUly 2021

RISKS tO tHE INFlAtION OUtlOOK  26 

Some goods that were highly sought after during the pandemic could 
see a softening in demand, leading to a better balance with supply 
over time. Some services meanwhile may face a burst of pent-up 
demand that could increase imbalances if the return of supply is slow 
while firms rehire and bring back capacity. In an environment of strong 
demand, businesses could find that they are able to raise prices. While 
estimates of these effects have been incorporated into the inflation 
projection, the effects could be stronger or more persistent than 
estimated.

(iv)  Weaker exports (↓)

Canadian exports could be weaker than in the base-case projection. 
This could be the case if the consequences of supply disruptions that 
constrain exports or competitiveness challenges associated with a 
strong Canadian dollar are greater than in the base case. At the same 
time, new tariffs or Buy American provisions could mute the benefit to 
Canadian exporters of strong US demand.

(v)  A more pronounced slowing of the Canadian housing 

market (↓) 
The base-case projection includes a gradual moderation in housing 
market activity. There is a risk that adjustment could be faster or 
more pronounced. Strong housing demand in some regions has been 
motivated in part by preferences to live in larger homes and to move 
out of cities. However, preferences could shift again as the pandemic’s 
effects wane, especially if employers expect their employees to return 
to the office. A rapid adjustment in the housing market could also have 
adverse effects on consumption, and these could be made even worse 
if house prices were to decline. 

(vi)  Sharp tightening of global financial conditions (↓)

Financial vulnerabilities remain important in many countries because 
of elevated debt levels and asset prices. If the global recovery were 
to stall, there could be a sharp pullback in risk appetite, constraining 
access to credit for higher-risk borrowers. Alternatively, if inflation were 
to be persistently higher, policy rates could rise faster than markets 
currently expect, and financial conditions could tighten. Either of these 
scenarios could trigger financial stress for vulnerable EMEs or other 
highly indebted borrowers, dampening global demand.

REPORT
April 2016

Canada’s Inﬂ ation-Control Strategy1

Infl ation targeting and the economy
• the Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to pro-
mote the economic and fi nancial well-being of Canadians .

• Canada’s experience with infl ation targeting since 1991
has shown that the best way to foster confi dence in the
value of money and to contribute to sustained economic
growth, employment gains and improved living standards
is by keeping infl ation low, stable and predictable . 

• In 2011, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed

Canada’s infl ation-control target for a further fi ve-year
period, ending 31 December 2016 . the target, as measured
by the total consumer price index (CPI), remains at the
2 per cent midpoint of the control range of 1 to 3 per cent .

The monetary policy instrument
• the Bank carries out monetary policy through changes
in the target overnight rate of interest .2 these changes
are transmitted to the economy through their infl uence
on market interest rates, domestic asset prices and the
exchange rate, which aﬀ ect total demand for Canadian
goods and services . the balance between this demand
and the economy’s production capacity is, over time, the
primary determinant of infl ation pressures in the economy .

• Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to
eight quarters—to work their way through the economy
and have their full eﬀ ect on infl ation . For this reason,
monetary policy must be forward-looking . 

• Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent

communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspec-
tive on the forces at work on the economy and their

implications for infl ation . the Monetary Policy Report is a 
key element of this approach . Policy decisions are typi-
cally announced on eight pre-set days during the year, 
and full updates of the Bank’s outlook, including risks to 
the projection, are published four times per year in the 
Monetary Policy Report .

Infl ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible
• Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which
means that the Bank is equally concerned about infl ation
rising above or falling below the 2 per cent target .
• Canada’s infl ation-targeting framework is ﬂ exible . 

typically, the Bank seeks to return infl ation to target over
a horizon of six to eight quarters . However, the most
appropriate horizon for returning infl ation to target will
vary depending on the nature and persistence of the
shocks buﬀ eting the economy .

Monitoring infl ation
• In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is
caused by fl uctuations in the prices of certain volatile
components (e .g ., fruit and gasoline) and by changes in
indirect taxes . For this reason, the Bank also monitors a
set of “core” infl ation measures, for example, the CPIX,
which strips out eight of the most volatile CPI compo-
nents and the eﬀ ect of indirect taxes on the remaining
components . these “core” measures allow the Bank to
“look through” temporary price movements and focus on
the underlying trend of infl ation . In this sense, core infl a-
tion is monitored as an operational guide to help the Bank
achieve the total CPI infl ation target . It is not a replace-
ment for it .

1  See Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inﬂ ation-Control Target (8 November 2011) and

Renewal of the Inﬂ ation-Control Target: Background Information—November 2011, which are both available on the Bank’s website .

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide 

 additional monetary stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions . the Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates,  available 
on the Bank’s website, describes these measures and the principles guiding their use .

Global Economy

The Bank expects global economic growth to strengthen gradually after a 
weaker-than-expected start to 2016. Incoming data are consistent with a 
continuation of modest global growth, as projected in the January Monetary 
Policy Report. This flow of data, as well as actions taken by central banks, 
has supported an improvement in financial conditions by alleviating markets’ 
immediate concerns about the possibility of a pronounced slowdown. The 
European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan have provided addi-
tional stimulus, while the US Federal Reserve has signalled a slower pace of 
monetary tightening. 

The anticipated firming in global growth, from approximately 3 per cent in 
2016 to around 3 1/2 per cent in 2017–18 (Table 1 and Chart 1), should be 
supported by accommodative monetary policy, a slowing rate of contrac-
tion in certain emerging-market economies (EMEs) and reforms to promote 
economic growth in various countries. The profile of growth is modestly lower 
than projected in January, however, reflecting the weaker start to 2016 in 
some regions, as well as a small downward revision to the estimated path of 
global potential gross domestic product (GDP). Oil prices have been volatile 
but remain low (Chart 2) and continue to affect regions differently. The adjust-
ment process for commodity exporters is being supported by past exchange 
rate depreciations, which are helping boost their net exports (Chart 3).

Solid US fundamentals are supporting moderate growth
Economic activity in the United States expanded at a modest pace at the 
end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016. While US private domestic demand 
in the latter part of 2015 proved more resilient than anticipated in the January 
Report, particularly consumption and residential investment, growth is now 
expected to remain modest in the first quarter of 2016. The softer start to the 
year reflects weaker consumer spending in January, additional drag from the 
oil and gas sector on investment and the lagged effect of a stronger US dollar 
on exports. 

Total GDP growth is projected to firm over 2016, bolstered by underlying 
strength in labour markets and consumer confidence (Chart 4), low oil 
prices and still-accommodative monetary policy. The US labour market 
averaged monthly job gains of over 200,000 during the first quarter of 2016, 
a strong pace that has been maintained since March 2014. There are signs 
that the strength in employment growth is now helping draw workers back 
into the labour market: since September 2015, the participation rate has 
risen steadily, reversing some of the decline seen since the 2007–09 global 
financial and economic crisis. 

Solid fundamentals are expected to support growth of around 2 per cent 
over the projection horizon. This is a more moderate pace than projected 
in the January Report, reflecting the weaker start to 2016 and revised 
assessments of housing and productivity trends. Residential investment is 
expected to expand at a robust pace of 9 per cent per year through 2018, 
although it has been revised down in light of a reassessment of underlying 
housing market fundamentals. This revision reflects a reassessment of the 
implications of the shift in US housing construction toward multiple-unit 
housing, which is less investment-intensive, and constrained access to 
mortgage credit for some borrowers. The persistent weakness in trend 
productivity growth also suggests a pace of GDP growth over the forecast 
horizon that is somewhat slower than previously anticipated. 

Inflation has picked up since the fourth quarter of 2015 and is expected to 
reach 2 per cent by 2018 as labour market slack is gradually absorbed.

Growth prospects in other major advanced economies 
remain tepid 
Modest economic recoveries in the euro area and Japan are being under-
pinned by expansionary monetary policy, low oil prices and past exchange 
rate depreciations. A number of factors continue to dampen growth and 
inflation. In the euro area, growth is being restrained by ongoing delever-
aging, weak investor confidence and tight lending conditions. These factors 
are being partly offset by an increase in fiscal spending to support the 
large inflow of refugees. Meanwhile, in Japan, lacklustre wage growth is 
restraining consumption. 

China is rebalancing to more sustainable growth, although 
with risks to financial stability 
China continues to pursue a more sustainable growth path for its economy. 
The economy is being rebalanced away from investment toward consump-
tion and away from heavy industry toward the service sector, which now 
accounts for just over 50 per cent of China’s GDP. While the pace of growth 
is expected to ease gradually, there are challenges inherent in the transition; 
for example, slower growth raises the possibility that highly leveraged firms 
could be a source of financial stress. 

China’s GDP growth is expected to slow from 6.9 per cent in 2015 to 
6.3 per cent in 2018—a decline that is somewhat more gradual than antici-
pated in the January Report. Recent fiscal announcements and credit 
data suggest that the Chinese government is taking measures to support 
domestic demand growth. Fiscal stimulus is expected to be focused on 
additional infrastructure spending and tax relief for businesses. While this 
additional policy support should boost growth in the short term, finan-
cial vulnerabilities will also increase further if the government’s targeted 
increases in broader credit growth are met.

In other oil-importing EMEs, growth is expected to strengthen as the sharp 
contractions in economic activity in some economies moderate, the net 
benefits of lower oil prices accumulate and progress is made on struc-
tural reforms, particularly the removal of regulatory obstacles to growth. 
Conditions in contracting economies such as Brazil have not improved by as 
much as anticipated, however. Net exports for oil-importing EMEs are also 
expected to be softer, a result of weaker external demand. The near-term 
outlook for oil-importing EMEs is therefore somewhat weaker relative to the 
January Report. 

Growth is expected to pick up in the rest of the world over 2017–18 as the 
Russian economy stabilizes and other oil-exporting economies adjust to 
lower oil prices. While the effects of this adjustment are expected to dis-
sipate, the outlook for the rest of the world is weaker relative to the January 
Report, reflecting further reductions in investment in the oil sector and addi-
tional fiscal cuts announced by some oil exporters. 

Although the recent period has been challenging for many EMEs, they have, 
on the whole, taken measures over the past two decades to improve their 
ability to withstand economic and financial stresses. Nonetheless, some 
pockets of vulnerabilities have intensified, particularly in countries where 
the decline in commodity prices has exacerbated geopolitical, political 
and fiscal concerns and in countries with rising US-dollar-denominated 
corporate debt. While many EMEs are planning further structural reforms to 
increase their resilience to external shocks and to support growth over the 
coming years, progress is likely to be uneven.

Estimates of the growth potential of the global economy 
have been reduced
The estimated growth potential of the global economy has been revised 
down to about 3 1/4 per cent, on average, over the projection horizon. 
The revision primarily reflects weaker-than-expected investment in EMEs, 
particularly those that export oil. The Bank has also lowered its assess-
ment of the growth rate of potential output for the US economy to about 
1 3/4 per cent, reflecting productivity growth that has remained lower than 
anticipated. While US productivity growth is expected to improve gradually, 
the ongoing weakness suggests a softer trend than previously estimated. 
The persistent sluggishness in global trade and investment in recent years 
may have also weighed on global productivity growth.

Commodity prices remain low 
Prices of energy and non-energy commodities remain well below historical 
averages (Chart 5). Uncertainty about the nature and speed of supply and 
demand adjustments is contributing to recent volatility in oil prices. Factors 
influencing these price movements include reductions in US shale oil pro-
duction, temporary supply disruptions in Iraq and Nigeria and improved 
market sentiment with respect to global growth (particularly for China). 

By convention, the Bank assumes that oil prices will remain near their recent 
levels. The per-barrel prices for Brent, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and 
Western Canada Select (WCS) in US dollars have recently averaged $40, 
$38 and $25, respectively, two to three dollars higher than the January 
assumption.

The near-term outlook for oil prices is subject to both upside and downside 
risks. Downside risks from elevated inventories remain, particularly in the 
US Midwest. In addition, if producers are able to find further cost savings 
or if US oil firms take advantage of the recent firming in prices to hedge 
future production, the rebalancing of the market may be more protracted 
than expected. There are equally important upside risks to prices. Reduced 
access to financing for highly indebted US shale oil producers could 
result in a faster-than-anticipated decline in supply. Some members of 
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-
OPEC producers are negotiating an output freeze, raising the likelihood of 
a broader agreement to curtail production. Political instability in some oil 
exporters could also lead to supply disruptions.

Over the medium term, the risks to oil prices are tilted to the upside, but 
the price level required to balance the market remains highly uncertain. The 
substantial reduction in US shale investment since 2014 is expected to lead 
to further declines in US oil production (Chart 6). As supply from non-OPEC 
countries decreases and demand growth remains steady, the current supply 
overhang in the global oil market is expected to diminish. The potential 
amount of a price increase is limited, however, because ongoing cost-cutting 
initiatives and technological advances are helping to lower production costs, 
in particular, for unconventional oil production, such as shale oil.

Non-energy commodity prices are modestly higher than January levels, 
reflecting increases across a range of subcomponents. The expectation of 
additional infrastructure spending in China has alleviated some concerns 
over future demand for base metals, providing support for their prices. Many 
metals are expected to remain in excess supply over the coming years, 
however, as recently completed mines continue to ramp up production 
globally. In contrast, lumber prices are expected to rise through 2018 since 
strong housing demand in the United States—albeit less robust than antici-
pated in January—coincides with more modest growth in Canadian lumber

expected to remain near current levels. In light of these forces, the Bank’s 
non-energy commodity price index is projected to stay near its recent level 
over the projection horizon. 

 

 

Financial conditions have improved
Financial conditions were deteriorating at the start of 2016 on heightened 
market concerns about the durability of the global recovery. However, data 
released since January as well as other factors have alleviated concerns 
about a sharp slowdown in global growth. Most equity index prices have 
increased, there have been portfolio inflows in many EMEs and credit 
spreads have narrowed (Chart 7). Actions taken by central banks have also 
been important in improving financial conditions. Additional easing by the 
Bank of Japan and the ECB has helped to lower sovereign yields further, 
while the euro area has also seen a decrease in corporate yields coinciding 
with the expansion of its quantitative easing program to include corporate 
debt. Markets have also interpreted statements by the US Federal Reserve 
as signalling a shift to a more moderate pace of monetary tightening, which 
has helped to maintain downward pressure on US Treasury yields, providing 
further support to asset prices.

Although volatility in financial markets has declined since January, market 
uncertainty over the strength of the global recovery remains. Correlations 
among global asset price movements, together with diminished liquidity 
in some markets, may make asset prices and capital flows susceptible to 
sharp movements should new economic data be disappointing. EMEs with 
large stocks of debt denominated in foreign currencies remain particularly 
vulnerable to sudden shifts in market sentiment (Chart 8).

Summary 
While the Bank’s foreign activity measure, an indicator of demand for 
Canadian exports, is expected to grow strongly over the forecast horizon, 
it has been revised down. This change reflects the revised outlook for US 
residential investment and investment in the US oil and gas sector, which 
are key sources of demand for Canadian exports. 

The Canadian dollar has appreciated against the US dollar in response to 
shifting market expectations for monetary policy paths in both countries as 
well as increases in commodity prices. By convention, the Canadian dollar 
is assumed to be close to its recent average of 76 cents over the projection 
horizon, compared with the 72 cents assumed in January.

Canadian Economy

Since the beginning of 2016, total CPI inflation has remained below 
2 per cent, on average. The downward pressure from declines in consumer 
energy prices and persistent excess capacity has been only partially offset 
by the temporary boost from the pass-through of the Canadian dollar’s past 
depreciation to the prices of consumer goods. These effects are expected 
to gradually diminish. As a result, total CPI inflation is projected to remain 
below 2 per cent through 2016 and to be close to 2 per cent thereafter. 
Core inflation is expected to be around 2 per cent throughout the projection 
horizon as the disinflationary effects of slack in the economy are counter-
balanced by the positive effects of exchange rate pass-through.

The Canadian economy continues to undergo complex adjustments to 
the declines in global commodity prices and in Canada’s terms of trade. 
Contraction of business investment in the energy sector has been an 
important drag on economic activity. Activity in areas outside the most 
affected industries has continued to expand, and employment and house-
hold expenditures have held up at the national level. 

The reorientation toward the non-resource sectors is being supported by 
the ongoing expansion in the United States, the past depreciation of the 
Canadian dollar and accommodative monetary and financial conditions. The 
complex adjustment will have important consequences for the growth of 
potential output for the next several years.1 The Bank’s estimate for potential 
output growth is now materially lower than previously estimated.

Real GDP is estimated to have increased by 2.8 per cent in the first quarter 
of 2016 but is expected to moderate in the second quarter. This growth 
dynamic primarily reflects volatility in trade flows and uneven timing of 
household expenditures over the first half of the year. Subsequently, growth 
is expected to strengthen as the drag from the resource sector wanes and 
the expansion of economic activity in the non-resource sector asserts itself 
as the dominant trend (Table 2 and Table 3). Real GDP is expected to grow 
by 1.7 per cent in 2016, 2.3 per cent in 2017 and 2.0 per cent in 2018.

The projection for economic activity through 2016 and 2017 has been 
revised up. Slower foreign demand growth, the higher Canadian dollar and 
a downward revision to business investment all have negative impacts on 
the outlook but are more than offset by the positive effects of the fiscal 
measures announced in the federal budget in March. The net effects of the 
upward revision to real GDP and the downward revision to potential output 
growth is that, in the Bank’s base-case projection, the output gap is likely 
to close sometime in the second half of 2017, somewhat earlier than antici-
pated in January.

1  The adjustment of potential output to the decline in commodity prices is expected to continue until 2019.

conditions (Chart 9).2 As a result of the ongoing weakness in commodity 
prices, business investment continued to decline (Chart 10). Growth was 
also restrained by further significant adjustments in inventory investment as 
firms drew down stocks from elevated levels and by a partial reversal of the 
surge in exports in the previous quarter. In contrast, household expenditures 
grew moderately, underpinned by gains in personal disposable income and 
increased household borrowing.

In previous Monetary Policy Reports, a decomposition of economic activity into oil- and gas-related industries, 
non-energy commodity-related industries and the rest of the economy indicated that non-energy commodity-
related industries were a source of weakness in 2015. In recent data, however, activity in resource-related 
manufactured goods industries has picked up. This observation may indicate that, on balance, the past 
depreciation of the dollar and increased foreign demand are now boosting activity in manufacturing.

Real GDP is estimated to have grown by 2.8 per cent in the first quarter, 
reflecting strength in monthly data on GDP, merchandise trade, housing and 
retail sales at the start of the year. However, activity in household expendi-
tures and exports have recently slowed, suggesting that real GDP growth 
should moderate to about 1.0 per cent in the second quarter. Overall, the 
Bank now estimates that real GDP growth will pick up in the first half of 
2016 to average roughly 2 per cent, somewhat stronger than anticipated in 
January (Table 3 and Chart 11).

The degree of slack in the economy remains significant 
Estimates from the Bank’s two measures of economic slack (the structural 
and statistical approaches) indicate a widening of the output gap since the 
onset of the terms-of-trade shock and currently point to material excess 
capacity in the Canadian economy (Chart 12). Similarly, the results of the 
Bank’s spring Business Outlook Survey suggest that capacity pressures 
remain subdued, particularly in the Prairies, where they continue to ease.

Measures of labour market health indicate continued slack: Canada’s 
unemployment rate was 7.1 per cent in March; and the prevalence of 
involuntary part-time employment, long-term unemployment and the 
absence of wage pressures all suggest that labour is being underutilized 
(Chart 13). 

Although national employment continues to increase, adjustment in the 
labour market is ongoing. British Columbia and Ontario have shown strong 
net job growth. In the service sector, strong employment growth has sup-
ported solid growth in total labour input. In goods-producing industries, 
including in the higher-paying mining, oil and gas sector, employment has 
been relatively weak (Chart 14). 

Overall, the Bank judges that the amount of excess capacity in the 
economy remains material in the first quarter of 2016, at between 1/2 and 
1 1/2 per cent.3

3  The projection is based on an assumed value for the output gap of -1.0 per cent in the first quarter of 
2016, as opposed to the January assumption of -1.3 per cent for the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily 
owing to upward revisions to estimates of growth in these two quarters. The level of potential GDP is 
estimated to be about 0.1 per cent higher in the first quarter of 2016 relative to the January Report.

Inflation has evolved largely as expected
Total inflation has evolved largely as anticipated and is expected to remain 
below 2.0 per cent in the coming quarters, reflecting the sharp drop in 
consumer energy prices. Total CPI inflation rose to 2.0 per cent in January, 
because of temporary base-year effects associated with particularly 
low gasoline prices in January 2015, and then fell back to 1.4 per cent in 
February. Looking through this monthly volatility, slack in the Canadian 
economy has continued to be a source of downward pressure on total infla-
tion. Meanwhile, exchange rate pass-through from the past depreciation of

the Canadian dollar has been exerting temporary upward pressure, which 
the Bank estimates added 0.8 to 1.0 percentage points to total CPI inflation 
in the first quarter of 2016. The importance of pass-through is illustrated 
by comparing inflation rates in Canada for selected goods with high import 
content to the rates for similar goods in the United States (Chart 15).

As the economy adjusts, activity will shift across sectors
The outlook for the Canadian economy is significantly affected by the 
ongoing adjustment to the decline in commodity prices. In the resource 
sector, investment is being scaled back and significant layoffs are ongoing. 
However, the effects of the negative factors weighing on the resource sector 
will become less intense, and the drag on overall GDP growth is expected to 
wane over 2016. Meanwhile, activity in the rest of the economy is expanding 
and is expected to be the main source of growth over the next few years. In 
particular, non-commodity exports are projected to trend upward, spurring 
investment and employment. The timing and magnitude of these respective 
adjustments in productive capacity in the two sectors will determine poten-
tial output growth and economic activity over the medium term. 

Potential output growth has been revised down
Potential output growth is expected to be weaker while the Canadian 
economy adjusts to lower commodity prices.4 Trend labour productivity and 
trend labour input influence the outlook for potential output. The current 
weakness in trend labour productivity growth reflects the declines in invest-
ment. As the economy restructures and investment in the non-resource 
sector picks up, trend labour productivity growth should accelerate. Trend 
labour input growth, meanwhile, is expected to continue to decline in 
response to slower population growth and continued population aging.

4  The Bank typically conducts an assessment of potential output growth each April.

Relative to the previous annual assessment conducted in April 2015, projec-
tions for potential output growth have been revised down, mainly reflecting 
slower growth in trend labour productivity as a result of weaker investment 
(Chart 17).5 Further details on the Bank’s reassessment of potential output 
are provided in the Appendix.

There is much uncertainty about the magnitude and timing of the effects 
of the commodity price shock on potential output. In addition to the direct 
impact of weaker investment, potential output is affected by the reallocation 
of investment and employment. As the non-resource sector gains strength 
and excess capacity is absorbed, investment, including through new firm 
creation, is expected. This expanded capacity and stronger activity could 
further reduce long-term unemployment and underemployment in the labour 
market. The procyclical effects of firm and employment creation could pro-
vide a small boost to potential output growth. However, the size and timing 
of these effects are highly uncertain. Because of the uncertainty associated 
with these and other factors, the Bank’s estimate for potential output growth 
is presented as a range, with the midpoint of the range averaging about 
1.5 per cent over the projection horizon.

Financial conditions remain accommodative
Financial conditions for households and businesses in Canada remain highly 
stimulative. While yields on 5-year Government of Canada bonds, as well 
as the funding costs of Canadian banks, are roughly unchanged since the 
beginning of the year, long-term mortgage rates have edged down to histor-
ical lows. In this context, growth in household mortgage credit has remained 
robust in recent months. 

5  The projection is based on the estimated rates of potential output growth from the middle of the Bank’s 

ranges (see the Appendix). The downward revisions to the projection of potential output growth in 
Canada and to the estimated global neutral interest rate imply a downward revision to the estimate for 
the neutral policy rate in Canada. The neutral nominal policy rate, at 3.25 per cent (in a range of 2.75 to 
3.75 per cent), is estimated to be 25 basis points lower than estimated in April 2015.

Most firms surveyed in the Bank’s spring Business Outlook Survey continue 
to characterize credit as easy or relatively easy to obtain. Indeed, following 
some slowing in 2015, the growth of business credit appears to have stabil-
ized somewhat above its historical average (5.4 per cent) in recent months. 
Nevertheless, firms directly or indirectly exposed to the energy sector 
reported a tightening in credit conditions. Similarly, the further tightening 
in business-lending conditions reported by the Bank’s Senior Loan Officer 
Survey was concentrated in the oil and gas sector. 

Investment continues to decline in the resource sector
The prices for oil, natural gas and other commodities remain low, and 
firms in the oil and gas sector have announced further cuts in their capital 
spending plans. Based on these announcements, the Bank estimates that 
the level of investment in that sector in 2016 is likely to decline sharply for a 
second year in a row, to about 60 per cent below its 2014 level. 

The sharp decline in investment in the oil and gas sector in 2015 and 2016 is 
expected to restrain future production. Growth in energy exports is therefore 
expected to moderate in the coming years but to remain positive as oil 
sands projects currently under construction are completed.

Overall growth in commodity exports is expected to remain modest over 
the projection horizon. Low prices and competitiveness challenges continue 
to dampen investment spending in mining. However, some non-energy 
commodity firms face more-favourable conditions. For example, lumber 
exporters should continue to benefit from an improving US housing market, 
and agricultural production and exports are projected to pick up as global 
food demand rises. 

Non-commodity exports are gathering momentum…
The reorientation of the Canadian economy toward the non-resource sector 
is being facilitated by the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar and 
accommodative financial conditions. There are signs that the sequence of 
increasing foreign demand, strengthening exports and improving business 
confidence is progressing. 

Looking through monthly volatility, non-commodity exports have recently 
strengthened and are expected to continue to grow at a solid pace, on 
average, with growth of US private domestic demand (Chart 18). Moreover, 
the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar has improved the price com-
petitiveness of Canadian products. While the timing and magnitude of the 
benefits of the depreciation differ across industries, several categories of 
goods exports that are more sensitive to the exchange rate are showing 
positive momentum (Chart 19). Examples include building and packaging 
materials, furniture and fixtures, paper and published products, and large 
motor vehicles (e.g., heavy trucks and buses). Nevertheless, since the Bank 
expects that some of the recent strength of non-commodity exports relative 
to foreign demand is temporary, export growth is projected to be stronger in 
2016 than in 2017. While non-commodity exports are expected to increase 
solidly, the profile is somewhat lower relative to January’s projection, given 
the downward revision to external demand and the higher assumed level for 
the Canadian dollar.

Findings from the Bank’s spring Business Outlook Survey support the 
outlook for total exports (Chart 20). More than half of the firms surveyed 
reported that US demand is providing a boost to their sales outlook. This 
includes firms already exporting to the United States, those in the process 
of refocusing their efforts to regain market share abroad and those devel-
oping new sales opportunities.

…which should support a pickup in business investment 
outside the resource sector
As non-commodity exports strengthen, the absorption of existing capacity 
in the sector is expected to encourage investment. Consequently, business 
investment is projected to expand starting in the second half of this year as 
capital expenditures in the non-resource sector pick up, more than offset-
ting the drag from lower investment in the resource sector (Chart 21). Since 
a large share of investment goods are foreign-sourced, this strengthening of 
investment is expected to lead to an increase in imports. 

Sectoral analysis also suggests that conditions for investment in the non-
resource sector have generally improved since 2014. Rates of manufacturing 
capacity utilization for many industries in export categories that are more 
sensitive to the exchange rate have risen close to their historical highs 
(Chart 22). As demand—both foreign and domestic—increases, these 
industries will need to invest in factories and machinery and equipment 
to expand production. In addition, for many exporters, the exchange rate 
depreciation has boosted margins and cash flow denominated in Canadian 
dollars, providing funding for them to expand their investment spending. 
There are increasingly tangible signs that businesses exposed to foreign 
markets, including those in service industries such as tourism and infor-
mation technology, intend to boost investment to take advantage of solid 
foreign demand. Meanwhile, although the population of firms in the mining, 
oil and gas industries has declined by 7.1 per cent since oil prices peaked 
in the middle of 2014, the number of firms in the rest of the economy has 
increased by 1.5 per cent.

Overall, investment outside the resource sector is expected to strengthen. 
The timing of this pickup remains uncertain as firms remain cautious: 
results of the spring Business Outlook Survey suggest that some firms 
continue to wait for signs of a sustained pickup in demand before increasing 
investment.

Fiscal measures will add to the growth of domestic 
demand 
The fiscal measures included in the March 2016 federal budget amount 
to roughly $25 billion of additional spending over the next two years. 
Specifically, the federal government will spend about $11 billion over this 
period on infrastructure investments and $12 billion on measures for house-
holds, including the new Canada Child Benefit. Several other spending 
measures, such as environmental projects, programs to improve the socio-
economic conditions of indigenous peoples, and the construction and reno-
vation of affordable housing, are also notable for their likely impact on GDP.

The impact of fiscal policy on economic activity depends on its multiplier 
effect—how much the level of output increases for every additional dollar 
of government stimulus. Multipliers vary according to the type of fiscal 
measure, which can be broadly divided into infrastructure investment, other 
government spending, and tax and transfer measures.6 Government infra-
structure investment tends to have a larger multiplier effect than other meas-
ures, since it often generates broader spillovers to the economy beyond the 
direct spending effects.7 The near-term impact on the economy of transfers 
and taxes, in contrast, may be smaller if households choose to save the 
additional income or use it to purchase goods and services from abroad. 

The effects of the recently announced fiscal measures will begin to be felt in 
2016 and will build through 2017. Analysis suggests that incorporating these 
new measures, as well as the recent measures introduced at the provincial 
level, into the projection results in a contribution to GDP growth of govern-
ment spending of 0.5 percentage points in 2016 and 0.6 percentage points 
in 2017 (Table 2).8 

Household spending is expected to grow moderately
Household expenditures are projected to grow at a moderate pace over 
the projection period, restrained by the ongoing effect of the decline in 
Canada’s terms of trade. While the terms of trade improved substantially 
in the 10-year period before oil prices began to decrease in the middle of 
2014, about half of those gains have now been lost.9 This represents a drop 
of more than $60 billion in national income. The resulting adverse effect on 
wealth and income is being partially offset by strengthening employment in 
the non-resource sector and the recently announced federal fiscal measures 
(notably, the new Canada Child Benefit). In recent data, the adjustment to 
the decline in commodity prices is evident in a comparison of employment, 
retail sales and housing activity across regions, with households in the oil-
producing provinces cutting expenditures sharply (Chart 23). 

In the housing market, new construction and activity in the resale market are 
strong in British Columbia and Ontario, while there are declines in housing 
activity in the oil-producing provinces and relative stability in Quebec 
and the Maritime provinces. The strength in British Columbia and Ontario 
appears, in part, to reflect local demand stimulated by employment growth. 
The shift in interprovincial migration in response to the oil price shock is 
reinforcing the regional divergence in housing market activity as workers 
leave the oil-producing provinces for Ontario and British Columbia. 

The strength of housing demand in Ontario and British Columbia is con-
tributing strongly to growth in residential mortgage credit. As a result, the 
overall ratio of household debt to disposable income has edged higher. 

6  There is considerable uncertainty associated with estimates of fiscal multipliers, including the timing of 
the direct and spillover effects of various measures on economic activity. Table A2.1 in the federal gov-
ernment’s Budget 2016, Growing the Middle Class, provides reasonable estimates of these multipliers. 
For example, government spending is estimated to have a multiplier of 1.4, while a personal income tax 
change is estimated to have a multiplier of 0.6 after two years, assuming no monetary policy response.

7  However, infrastructure spending typically involves longer lags between expenditure decisions and 

actual outlays.

8  The Bank’s projection of economic activity in Canada is based on the multipliers in Table A2.1 in the federal 
budget. Since some of the federal fiscal measures would influence GDP through channels other than direct 
government spending, the total effect on real GDP is larger than the effect on real GDP through the upward 
revision to government spending. All else being equal, the federal fiscal measures would increase the level 
of real GDP by about 0.5 per cent in the 2016–17 fiscal year and 1.0 per cent in the 2017–18 fiscal year.

9  The terms of trade have fallen by 12 per cent since their peak in mid-2011.

The economy is likely to return to potential sometime in 
the second half of 2017
On an average annual basis, real GDP is expected to grow by 1.7 per cent in 
2016, 2.3 per cent in 2017 and 2.0 per cent in 2018 (Table 2). This projection 
has been revised up slightly from January, reflecting stronger government 
expenditures associated with the recently announced fiscal measures that 
more than offset the drag associated with weaker foreign demand and a 
stronger dollar, a more severe contraction of business investment in the 
oil and gas sector, and weaker trend productivity growth. In view of these 
revisions and the downward revision to the Bank’s assessment of poten-
tial output growth, the Bank now projects that the output gap will close 
sometime in the second half of 2017, somewhat earlier than anticipated in 
January. 

Given the uncertainty around the estimates of the output gap, the projection 
for the timing of the economy’s return to full potential is highly imprecise. On 
its own, uncertainty associated with the estimate of the output gap at the 
start of the projection implies considerable uncertainty about the timing of 
the return of economic activity to full potential (Chart 24). Other factors also 
contribute to uncertainty regarding the trajectory of the output gap.10

10  For example, as presented in the Appendix, estimates of the potential growth rate of the economy 

become more uncertain over the projection horizon. In addition, at the current juncture, imprecision is 
further amplified by the uncertainty associated with the ongoing complex economic adjustments of the 
Canadian economy to the decline in commodity prices, as well as to uncertainty regarding the trajec-
tory of commodity prices themselves.

Inflation is expected to return sustainably to 2 per cent 
sometime in the second half of 2017 
Total CPI inflation is expected to remain below 2 per cent through 2016 as 
disinflationary pressures associated with weak consumer energy prices and 
excess capacity in the Canadian economy more than offset the inflationary 
effects of exchange rate pass-through (Chart 25). The Bank estimates that 
the upward pressure on total CPI inflation from exchange rate pass-through 
peaked in the fourth quarter of 2015 (adding about 0.9 to 1.1 percentage 
points to total inflation) and will gradually fade through 2016. Total CPI

inflation is expected to remain at 2 per cent on a sustained basis after the 
economy stabilizes at full capacity, although the timing is highly uncertain 
given the ongoing complex economic adjustments (Chart 26). Core infla-
tion is expected to remain near 2 per cent throughout the projection period 
as the upward pressure from exchange rate pass-through roughly offsets 
downward pressure from excess supply.

The forecast for total CPI inflation is revised up marginally from January, 
reflecting revisions to both the projection of the output gap and the impact 
on inflation of temporary factors (Table 3). These factors include a revised 
view on the evolution of gasoline margins and the recent announcement 
of a cap-and-trade plan for carbon emissions in Ontario.11 The impact of 
these developments on inflation will be partly offset by a downward revision 
to exchange rate pass-through since the assumed level of the Canadian 
dollar is now higher. Overall, inflation is expected to return sustainably to 
2 per cent sometime in the second half of 2017, somewhat earlier than 
anticipated in January. 

Medium-term inflation expectations have continued to be well anchored at 
2 per cent. The March Consensus Economics forecast for total CPI inflation 
was 1.6 per cent for 2016, likely reflecting weak oil prices at the time of the 
survey, and 2.0 per cent for 2017. Results from the Bank’s spring Business 
Outlook Survey indicate that a large majority of firms continue to expect CPI 
inflation to remain within the Bank’s 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control range 
over the next two years.

Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, a reasonable range 
around the base-case projection for total CPI inflation is ±0.3 percentage 
points. This range is intended to convey a sense of forecast uncertainty. A 
fan chart, which is derived using statistical analysis of the Bank’s forecast 
errors, provides a complementary perspective (Chart 26).

Risks to thE inflation outlook  25 

Risks to the inflation outlook

The outlook for inflation is subject to several risks emanating from both the 
external environment and the domestic economy. The Bank judges that the 
risks to the projected path for inflation are roughly balanced.

(i)  Stronger real GDP growth in the United States

While the outlook for actual and potential GDP growth in the United 
States has been revised downward, it is possible that this reflects an 
overly cautious interpretation of labour force and productivity trends. 
Productivity in the United States may rise more than expected if the 
persistent weakness in US growth contains a larger-than-estimated 
cyclical element. In particular, the ongoing economic recovery could 
lead to an acceleration in firm creation, greater adoption of new 
technologies and more innovation. As well, the ongoing strength 
in the US labour market and the creation of new businesses may 
draw discouraged workers back into the labour force. Any of these 
developments would raise the potential growth rate of the US economy, 
boosting actual GDP growth. Stronger US economic growth could 
have positive spillovers to Canada from increased demand for 
Canadian exports and improved global confidence. 

(ii)  Stronger momentum for Canadian exports 

Canadian exports have recently shown renewed momentum, out-
pacing foreign demand. The Bank’s projection for exports neverthe-
less remains conservative and assumes that some of the recent 
strength is transitory, given the uncertain timing of the impact of past 
exchange rate depreciation. However, the recent strength in exports 
could indicate that the effect of the dollar’s depreciation is more 
positive. Firms may have begun to use their better pricing position to 
increase their share of foreign markets. In such a scenario, the recent 
momentum in exports may prove more durable than assumed in the 
Bank’s base-case projection, especially as US and global demand 
strengthen. Exports could continue to outpace foreign demand for 
some time as firms take advantage of the new environment.

(iii)  More cautious behaviour by Canadian consumers

Canadian household spending has underpinned economic activity 
and is expected to continue to do so over the projection horizon. In 
the wake of the terms-of-trade shock, consumer confidence declined 
significantly, primarily reflecting the deterioration of sentiment in the 
energy-producing regions. As the effect of the shock on incomes 
builds, the weakness in confidence may diffuse more broadly. At 

 

 

26  Risks to thE inflation outlook

the same time, households have become more indebted, which may 
cause them to be more prudent and save more than expected, based 
on historical experience.

(iv)  More pronounced adjustment of the Canadian economy to 

low energy prices 
Considerable uncertainty remains about whether energy producers 
and related firms will be able to maintain their activity levels at cur-
rent low prices. While there are upside risks to energy prices over the 
medium term, the longer these low prices persist, the more likely that 
firms will be forced to restrict production, employment and investment 
spending more than currently anticipated, with associated nega-
tive consequences for energy-producing regions and the broader 
economy. 

(v)  Slower growth in emerging-market economies

Growth could be slower than expected in some EMEs, particularly 
commodity exporters, because some of those already in recession 
could face renewed stresses and some additional countries could 
come under pressure. Further tightening of US monetary policy could 
trigger large capital outflows, tighter credit conditions and debt risks 
in EMEs that have issued significant amounts of corporate debt 
denominated in US dollars. Important structural reforms, which are 
necessary to expand potential output growth, could also be delayed. 
In addition, China’s financial system could come under stress from the 
anticipated buildup of financial imbalances as authorities put greater 
emphasis on short-term growth, which could generate broader 
spillovers to economic activity. Slower growth in China or other 
EMEs could affect Canada through several channels, including lower 
commodity prices, weaker export sales, increased uncertainty and 
financial market volatility.

appendix: updated Estimates of 
Potential output Growth

This appendix provides an update on the Bank’s 
estimates of potential output growth through 2020 
(Table A-1).1 Potential output can be decomposed into 
two key components: trend labour input (trend number 
of hours worked) and trend labour productivity (trend 
output per hour worked). It is important to note that a 
range of models, indicators and judgment contribute to 
the estimation. 

Potential output growth is estimated to be weaker than 
expected in our last reassessment in April 2015. The 
main factor explaining the downward revision is the fur-
ther decline in the prices of oil and other commodities. 
This has resulted in business investment in the resource 
sector that is weaker than it would have been otherwise, 
leading to slower growth in capital deepening and labour 
productivity. Investment outside the oil and gas sector 
has also been weaker than anticipated, although it is 
expected to pick up. 

Trend labour input growth will continue to gradually slow 
over the projection horizon, from 0.7 per cent in 2015 to 
0.4 per cent in 2020, reflecting ongoing demographic 
trends. Trend labour input can be decomposed into 
working-age population, the trend employment rate and 
trend average hours worked per week. The growth rate 

of the working-age population is expected to slow as 
the population ages. Population aging will also lead to 
declining trend employment rates and trend average hours 
worked (Chart A-1). Workers older than 55 are less likely 
to be employed and, when they are employed, are likely to 
work fewer hours than prime-age workers (those aged 25 
to 54). Recent increases in the labour market participation 
rate of older workers only partially compensate for the 
other negative demographic trends.

Trend labour productivity growth is also being affected 
by the sectoral reallocation of labour. The movement 
of workers from high-productivity sectors (such as oil 
and gas) to other sectors of the economy (the service 
sector), in which productivity is typically lower, will tem-
porarily depress productivity. This effect may be exacer-
bated by the reduced productivity that often occurs 
when workers first transition to new job opportunities. In 
the longer run, lower energy prices could support trend 
labour productivity by freeing resources for non-energy 
firms to make investments that augment productivity. In 
addition, after the adjustment, sectors that have tended 
to exhibit stronger productivity growth may also repre-
sent a larger share of the economy, thereby contributing 
to stronger aggregate productivity growth.

There is much uncertainty about the outlook for poten-
tial output growth, given the magnitude of the com-
modity price shock and the resulting adjustment. Capital 
deepening outside the resource sector could lead to 
greater gains in productivity than expected as firms 
adopt new technologies to meet demand from foreign 
markets. It is also possible that the recent prolonged 
period of weak economic conditions, aggravated by 
the decline in commodity prices, could have caused 
individuals to drop out of the labour force. If these 
workers were to reintegrate into the labour market as 
the non-resource sector gains strength, growth rates in 
trend labour input and potential output could be higher 
than estimated. Overall, a sensitivity analysis of the 
various assumptions on which our projection is based 
suggests a range for the growth of potential output of 
about ±0.3 percentage points around the base case in 
2016, increasing to ±0.6 percentage points in 2018 and 
±0.7 percentage points in 2019 and 2020.

for labour productivity

Slower growth of trend labour productivity also con-
tributes to weaker potential output growth between 
2015 and 2017 relative to recent history (Chart A-2). 
Trend labour productivity depends on capital deepening 
and trend total factor productivity. Capital deepening 
contributes only modestly to trend labour productivity 
growth over the 2016–17 period, reflecting the weak 
business investment resulting from the retrenchment 
in the resource sector. Capital deepening will increase 
over 2018–20 as the drag on investment from the energy 
sector vanishes and the growth in investment from 
expansion in the rest of the economy picks up. Trend 
labour productivity growth is projected to return to its 
historical average by 2020.

Canada’s Inflation-Control Strategy1
Inflation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote 

the economic and financial well-being of Canadians.

pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s 
outlook, including risks to the projection, are published four 
times per year in the Monetary Policy Report.

  Canada’s experience with inflation targeting since 1991 has 

shown that the best way to foster confidence in the value 
of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth, 
employment gains and improved living standards is by keeping 
inflation low, stable and predictable.

Inflation targeting is symmetric and flexible
  Canada’s inflation-targeting approach is symmetric, which 

means that the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising 
above or falling below the 2 per cent target.

  In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 

Canada’s inflation-control target for a further five-year period, 
ending December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the 
consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 per cent midpoint 
of the control range of 1 to 3 per cent.

  Canada’s inflation-targeting framework is flexible. Typically, 

the Bank seeks to return inflation to target over a horizon of six 
to eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for 
returning inflation to target will vary depending on the nature 
and persistence of the shocks buffeting the economy.

The monetary policy instrument
  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes in the 

target for the overnight rate of interest.2 These changes are 
transmitted to the economy through their influence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate, 
which affect total demand for Canadian goods and services. 
The balance between this demand and the economy’s 
production capacity is, over time, the primary determinant of 
inflation pressures in the economy.

  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight 
quarters—to work their way through the economy and have 
their full effect on inflation. For this reason, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent com-
munications, the Bank regularly reports its perspective on 
the forces at work on the economy and their implications for 
inflation. The Monetary Policy Report is a key element of this 
approach. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight 

Monitoring inflation
  In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in 
indirect taxes such as GST, can cause sizable fluctuations in 
CPI.

  In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through 

such transitory movements in CPI inflation and focuses on a 
set of “core” inflation measures that better reflect the under-
lying trend of inflation. In this sense, these measures act as an 
operational guide to help the Bank achieve the CPI inflation 
target. They are not a replacement for CPI inflation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core inflation are CPI-
trim, which excludes CPI components whose rates of change 
in a given month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which 
corresponds to the price change located at the 50th percentile 
(in terms of basket weight) of the distribution of price changes; 
and CPI-common, which uses a statistical procedure to track 
common price changes across categories in the CPI basket.

Inflation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide additional  monetary 

stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website, 
describes these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Global Economy

Global economic growth is solid and broad-based, but the outlook is sub-
ject to considerable risk from escalating trade tensions. The expansion has 
been underpinned by an upswing in world trade and business investment 
(Chart 1). In the United States, new government spending plans, in addition 
to previously announced tax cuts, are expected to boost growth over the 
next few years. The growth outlook for most other regions is also modestly 
stronger than anticipated in the January Monetary Policy Report. Global 
growth is expected to ease from around 3 3/4 per cent in 2018 to about 
3 1/2 per cent in 2020 (Table 1).

This projection incorporates a higher estimated level of potential output for 
some major advanced economies, partly reflecting greater labour force par-
ticipation (Box 1). The additional estimated capacity is likely a contributing 
factor to subdued inflation in 2017. More recently, core inflation has firmed 
(Chart 2). Financial conditions remain supportive of growth, and market 
volatility, triggered in part by geopolitical and trade-policy concerns, has 
risen from extraordinarily low levels.

Trade policy is an increasingly prominent risk to the global economic 
expansion. US tariff announcements and proposed retaliatory actions by 
China raise the risk of a more pronounced shift away from a multilateral,

renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Even 
without changes in trade arrangements, increased concerns about trade 
policies could lead to a sharper-than-expected tightening of financial 
conditions, lower confidence and a more pronounced slowing of growth. 
The Bank’s base-case scenario, while predicated on the assumption that 
existing agreements will remain in place, continues to incorporate adverse 
effects from uncertainty on global investment and NAFTA-related judgment 
specific to Canada and Mexico. By convention, the direct impacts of tariffs 
announced by the United States and China will be added to the Bank’s 
forecast if, and when, they are implemented.

Annual assessment of global potential output growth
Global potential output growth is es timated to have reached 
a trough of around 3 1/4 per cent in 2017, after a series of 
declines over the past decade caused primarily by popula-
tion aging and slower productivity growth .1
Global potential growth is expected to remain around 3 1/4 
to 3 1/2 per cent over the projection horizon . In the United 
States, potential growth is expected to strengthen on rising 
business investment, from around 1 3/4 per cent in 2017 to 
about 2 per cent in 2018 . This rate is above the estimates of 
around 1 1/4 per cent in the years immediately following the 
2007–09 global ﬁ nancial and economic crisis, but remains 
below the 3 per cent average of the decade before the crisis . 
China’s potential growth rate is anticipated to continue 
slowing, given an aging population and a shift away from 
investment-led growth . In other emerging-market econ-
omies, potential growth is expected to increase modestly, 
owing in part to structural reforms .
The level of global potential output has been revised up 
over history . The improvement refl ects new capital stock 
estimates in the “rest of the world” grouping as well as an 
upward revision to trend labour supply in some advanced 
economies . In the United States, labour force participa-
tion by prime-age workers has been rising in recent years, 
suggesting that the number of people available for work

US growth is stronger with new fiscal stimulus
The US economy has been expanding at a solid pace, with private domestic 
demand rebounding at the end of 2017. Softness in consumption in the first 
quarter of 2018 is expected to be transitory. The labour market has been 
strong: more than 200,000 new jobs were created per month, on average, 
over the past six months. Rising prime-age labour force participation in 
recent years has also contributed to a higher estimate of potential output. 
Tax reform and deregulation may have increased incentives to shift invest-
ment to the United States from other jurisdictions.

Sizable fiscal stimulus should lift growth over the course of the next three 
years. New legislation since the January Report authorizes more than 
US$300 billion in extra federal expenditures. The combined budgetary 
impact of the planned spending increase and recent tax reforms is expected 
to amount to roughly US$1 trillion over the projection horizon, which should 
provide a material boost to growth.1 Since the US economy is already 
operating at around potential, the new spending is expected to add some 
additional upward pressure on inflation and bond yields.

1  The effects of the recent tax reforms are expected to accumulate to boost the level of GDP by about 
1 per cent in 2020. The Bank’s January projection included the impact of reductions in personal and 
corporate taxes.

The US economy is now forecast to grow on average at about 2 3/4 per cent 
over 2018–19, well above the rate of potential growth. Consumption is 
expected to rise at a healthy pace, underpinned by a strong labour market 
and fiscal stimulus. Business investment should be supported by a solid 
expansion of private demand, as well as by tax changes. Gross domestic 
product (GDP) growth is projected to ease to around 2 per cent in 2020, 
close to US potential growth, as support from fiscal and monetary policy 
diminishes.

Growth has been solid in the euro area and Japan
The euro area saw broad-based growth of about 2 3/4 per cent in the fourth 
quarter of 2017, and recent developments indicate that the economy will 
likely continue to grow above potential. Job gains have been healthy, and 
business and consumer confidence have remained high. The pace of growth 
is anticipated to slow from 2 1/4 per cent to 1 1/2 per cent by 2020 as capacity 
constraints intensify and monetary policy stimulus is gradually withdrawn. 
This profile is somewhat stronger than in January, reflecting upward revi-
sions to potential growth and more solid domestic demand.

In Japan, an improved global backdrop and high consumer confidence have 
supported a healthy expansion in business investment and consumption. 
GDP growth is projected to be around 1 1/2 per cent in 2018, and to mode-
rate significantly by 2020 in the wake of a planned 2019 hike in the value-
added tax.

Growth in emerging markets remains strong
The Chinese economy grew by close to 7 per cent in 2017, stronger than 
anticipated in the January Report, with some extra momentum spilling 
into 2018. Growth is still expected to decline from around 6 1/2 per cent in 
2018 to near 6 per cent in 2020, as part of the continued transition to more 
sustainable growth. Financial sector measures adopted since the start of 
2017 have constrained the expansion of shadow banking and contributed 
to a softening of credit growth. Nevertheless, financial vulnerabilities remain 
elevated.

The ongoing expansion in other oil-importing emerging-market economies 
(EMEs) is anticipated to continue to support global growth. Exchange 
rate depreciation in some countries and strong external demand suggest 
a brighter outlook for exports than in January, leading to a somewhat 
faster pace of expansion of around 4 1/4 per cent over the projection. In oil-
exporting countries, the effects of ongoing fiscal consolidation and past oil 
price declines are expected to continue to dissipate, leading to a pickup in 
growth.

Inflation is firming in some advanced economies
US core inflation has continued to firm, as anticipated. Core inflation is 
expected to rise further in the coming quarters as the economy experiences 
more excess demand and the transitory effect of the past decline in tele-
communication prices passes. US wage growth has been moderate by most 
measures but is expected to pick up with a tightening labour market.

Core inflation in the euro area and Japan has increased since the end of 
2017. Inflation in these regions is nonetheless still soft and is anticipated to 
rise only gradually toward central bank targets over the projection horizon.

Global financial conditions remain supportive of 
economic activity
US government bond yields have risen since January, reflecting actual and 
expected changes in monetary policy (Chart 3). Monetary policy norma-
lization is occurring from different starting points and at different speeds, 
with the United States further along than other advanced economies. In 
many advanced economies where policy interest rates were constrained by 
their effective lower bounds, central banks have relied on unconventional 
tools, including quantitative easing and forward guidance. As these policy 
interventions are unwound, the dampening effects of monetary policy on 
volatility are diminishing.

Financial conditions are still supportive of economic activity, even with 
recent yield increases and equity price declines. Despite the more robust 
US outlook, and expectations of additional monetary tightening, the US 
dollar is around 5 per cent lower on a trade-weighted basis than it was a year 
ago. Term premiums and risk premiums remain low by historical standards. 
Faster-than-expected increases in interest rates, potentially triggered 
by inflation concerns, could lead to financial market turbulence globally. 
In some EMEs, the February rise in financial market volatility caused a 
brief increase in portfolio outflows, highlighting the vulnerability of these 
countries to sharper increases in yields.

Rising global demand is helping support oil prices
The recent averages of global oil prices are largely in line with those 
assumed in the January Report. Higher global oil demand and lower 
production by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 
(OPEC) have led to inventory declines, reducing the downside risk to prices 
(Chart 4). US shale rig counts have continued to rise, and US oil production 
has increased by more than one million barrels per day since April 2017.

The largely offsetting strength in both demand growth and US shale output 
growth suggests that risks to oil prices are roughly balanced. By convention, 
the Bank assumes that oil prices will stay near their recent levels throughout 
the projection horizon (Box 2, page 11).

While the spread between West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western 
Canada Select (WCS) has narrowed recently, it remains wide due to trans-
portation constraints. Natural gas prices, meanwhile, have dropped sharply 
due to weather-related demand fluctuations in North America and longer-
term increases in supply.

After steadily rising over the second half of 2017, the Bank’s non-energy 
commodity price index (BCNE) has been relatively stable since January. 
Robust US housing starts and rail bottlenecks have led to stronger lumber 
prices. Newly announced tariffs by the United States and China have 
weighed on prices for iron ore and some agricultural commodities, such as 
hogs. Looking ahead, the BCNE is expected to remain near its current level.

Canadian Economy

Canada’s economic growth has moderated, and the economy is operating 
close to capacity. While a moderation was anticipated, temporary factors—
notably, volatility in trade shipments, amplified by transport bottlenecks, 
and the dynamic response of housing markets to regulatory changes—are 
resulting in sizable short-term fluctuations in growth.

Looking through these fluctuations, economic growth is projected to average 
slightly above that of potential output over the next three years. Real GDP 
growth is now projected to be about 2 per cent in both 2018 and 2019 
and to ease to 1.8 per cent in 2020, the estimated growth rate of potential. 
This profile reflects a slight downward revision in 2018 and a more notable 
upward revision in 2019 relative to the January projection (Table 2). The 
higher profile for economic activity incorporates additional fiscal stimulus 
and upward revisions to the estimated profiles of potential output (see 
Appendix, page 25) and national income.

Over the projection horizon, the composition of growth is expected to shift, 
with a declining contribution from household spending and a rising relative 
contribution from business investment and exports. Higher interest rates are 
anticipated to contribute to this adjustment. Monetary and fiscal policy are

expected to support economic activity over the projection horizon and to 
help mitigate the drag on business investment and exports associated with 
trade-policy uncertainty and competitiveness challenges.

Inflation is close to target. Both consumer price index (CPI) inflation and 
the Bank’s preferred measures of core inflation have recently increased to 
around 2 per cent. The temporary factors putting upward pressure on infla-
tion, namely gasoline prices and minimum wage increases, more than offset 
the diminishing drag from electricity and food prices. Since these upward 
pressures are expected to persist longer than the downward pressures, 
CPI inflation is forecast to be modestly higher in 2018 than anticipated in 
January but to still return to about the 2 per cent target thereafter.

Growth is expected to strengthen after a slow first 
quarter
While real GDP is expected to grow at around 2 per cent, on average, in 
the first half of 2018, the Bank anticipates a swing in quarter-over-quarter 
growth rates (Chart 5). Fluctuations are found mainly in exports, housing 
and investment. Accounting for these factors, economic activity is estimated 
to have expanded by 1.3 per cent in the first quarter and is forecast to 
rebound and grow by 2.5 per cent in the second quarter (Table 3).

Exports declined in the first quarter, in part reflecting transportation issues 
that interrupted the shipment of some commodities. These disruptions are 
anticipated to be temporary, and export growth is expected to rebound 
in the second quarter, led by a large increase in exports of crude oil as 
production growth continues. Non-energy commodity exports, such as 
lumber and agricultural products, will begin growing again as the backlog of 
shipments caused by poor weather and capacity issues in rail transportation 
are addressed.

Last observation: March 2018 

Housing activity is estimated to have contracted sharply in the first quarter, 
following the implementation of the revised B-20 Guideline.2 The contraction 
was amplified as some homebuyers acted quickly in the fourth quarter 
of 2017 to purchase a home before being subject to the new measure 
(Chart 6). In the second quarter of 2018, housing activity is expected to pick 
up as resales start to recover.

Investment growth likely paused in the first quarter, due mainly to the com-
pletion of some major energy projects late in 2017. The contraction of energy 
investment should offset the ongoing expansion of investment in other sec-
tors. The positive trend in investment spending is expected to reassert itself 
in the second quarter of 2018. Recent import data continue to signal robust 
growth of investment in machinery and equipment (Chart 7).

2  The revised B-20 Guideline, announced by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in 
October 2017, took effect on January 1, 2018. It is aimed at strengthening residential mortgage underwri-
ting practices.

 Imports of machinery and equipment

 Investment in machinery and equipment

Sources: Statistics Canada and Bank of Canada calculations 

Last observation: 2017Q4 

Compared with the January projection, economic growth was weaker in the 
fourth quarter of 2017, mainly because of stronger-than-expected imports 
of machinery and equipment. While real GDP expanded at close to potential 
growth, the contribution of domestic demand was strong (Chart 5). The 
estimate for economic growth in the first quarter of 2018 is also revised 
down, largely reflecting the shifting of activity across quarters.

Potential output growth is revised up
With this Report, the Bank provides its annual reassessment of the 
ranges of potential output growth. Potential output growth is expected 
to be stronger than estimated in April 2017, at 1.8 per cent between 
2018 and 2020, and 1.9 per cent in 2021 (Box 2 and the Appendix). Growth 
of trend labour productivity is expected to improve, owing to stronger 
business investment. Trend labour input growth will continue to slow, due to 
population aging, with immigration providing only a partial offset. The Bank’s 
assessment of potential output is subject to considerable uncertainty, and 
thus the estimates are presented as a range (Table 2).

The economy continues to operate close to capacity
With positive revisions to potential output and a lower-than-expected level 
of GDP, the Bank judges that the output gap in the first quarter of 2018 was 
between -0.75 and +0.25 per cent (Box 2). While this range is somewhat 
lower than assessed in January, it still implies that the Canadian economy 
has been operating close to capacity for three consecutive quarters.

Although firms added to the economy’s potential in recent quarters by 
increasingly investing in machinery, equipment and structures and expan-
ding employment, some continue to face significant production constraints.

•  The neutral nominal policy rate is deﬁ ned as the real 
rate consistent with output sustainably at its potential 
level and infl ation equal to target, on an ongoing basis, 
plus 2 per cent for the infl ation target . It is a medium- to 
long-term equilibrium concept . The Bank revisited its 
analysis of the neutral rate in conjunction with its annual 
reassessment of potential output . For Canada, the Bank 
estimates that the neutral rate continues to be between 
2 .5 and 3 .5 per cent, the same range as in the January 
Report . The economic projection is based on the mid-
point of this range .

•  Since April 2017, the base-case scenario has incorpor-

ated some negative judgment on investment and export 
growth . Initially, judgment accounted for the eﬀ ects of 
uncertainty around trade policy and, more recently, it 
has also accounted for the expected loss of investment 
competitiveness due to the US tax reform . These factors 
are expected to reduce the levels of business invest-
ment a nd exports by about 3 per cent and 1 ½   per cent, 
respectively, by the end of 2020 (Table 2-A) .

Key inputs to the base-case projection
The Bank’s projection is always conditional on several key 
assumptions, and changes to them will aﬀ ect the outlook 
for the global and Canadian economies . The Bank regularly 
reviews these assumptions and assesses the sensitivity 
of the economic projection to them . The Bank’s current 
assumptions are as follows:
•  Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent average 

levels: the per-barrel prices in US dollars for Brent, West 
Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western Canada Select 
(WCS) are about $65, $60 and $40, respectively . Brent 
and WTI are about the same as assumed in the January 
Report, while WCS is higher by about $5 .

•  By convention, the Bank does not attempt to forecast 

the exchange rate in the base-case projection . Over the 
projection horizon, the Canadian dollar is assumed to 
remain close to its recent average of 78 cents, compared 
with the 79 cents assumed in January and 81 cents in 
October .

•  The Bank estimates that the output gap was in a range of 
-0 .75 to +0 .25 per cent in the ﬁ rst quarter of 2018 . This 
compares with the January assumption that the output 
gap was in a range of -0 .25 to +0 .75 per cent in the 
fourth quarter of 2017 .1

•  Canadian potential output growth is assumed to remain 

at 1 .8 per cent between 2018 and 2020, and to reach 
1 .9 per cent in 2021 . This represents an upward revision 
relative to the January Report, which assumed growth 
to be averaging 1 .6 per cent over 2018–19 . Details on the 
Bank’s assessment of potential output are provided in 
the Appendix on page 25 .

1  The level of potential output in the fourth quarter of 2017 is estimated to have 
been 0 .3 per cent higher than assumed in the January Report . This refl ects an 
upward revision to trend labour input due to strong employment gains in 2017 . The 
most recent data also show that the level of real GDP was 0 .1 per cent weaker than 
expected in the fourth quarter of 2017 .

The overall industrial rate of capacity utilization is now close to its historical 
peak, with several sectors at or near their post-2003 highs (Chart 8).3 In 
addition, the spring Business Outlook Survey (BOS) indicated that capacity 
pressures have moderated but are still close to recent highs, particularly 
outside the oil- and gas-producing regions.

The labour market continues to improve across sectors and regions, 
although the growth of employment and hours worked has slowed since 
the beginning of 2018 (Chart 9). The unemployment rate remains near its 

3  Among industries in Statistics Canada’s data on capacity utilization, which represent nearly 30 per cent 

of Canadian GDP at basic prices, roughly three-quarters are within 5 percentage points of their post-
2003 peak.

40-year low. Job vacancies have risen by nearly 25 per cent over the past 
year and were at 470,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, considerably higher 
than the typical annual expansion of employment. Strong hiring intentions 
and more difficulties recruiting, as reported in the most recent BOS, also point 
to tightening labour markets and shrinking labour market slack. However, 
there are remaining elements of unemployment and underemployment: the 
long-term unemployment rate is still relatively high, the youth participation rate 
has room to increase, and BOS respondents in the oil- and gas-producing 
regions continue to point to remaining labour market slack.

The overall improvement in the labour market has been contributing to rising 
wages (Chart 10 and Box 3). Firms surveyed in the spring BOS report signs 
of increasing wage pressures, due to competition for labour and, to a lesser 
extent, minimum wage increases. Wage growth is somewhat below what 
would be expected were the economy operating with no excess labour.

Box 3

Labour market conditions and wage growth
Over the past year, the Canadian economy has made 
considerable progress in job creation and in the growth 
of average hours worked . In addition, the unemployment 
rate fell to a historically low level . In light of the signiﬁ cant 
improvement in labour market conditions and the sub-
stantial reduction in the level of labour market slack, wage 
growth picked up as well . The Bank’s estimate of underlying 
wage growth increased from 1 .1 per cent in mid-2016 to 
2 .3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2017 (Chart 10) .

Recent evolution of labour market conditions 
and wages
Hours worked declined in January in both the Survey of 
Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) and the Labour 
Force Survey (LFS) . While the decline likely refl ects some 
payback following strength in prior months, the minimum 
wage increases in some provinces may have also con-
tributed . LFS employment gains resumed in the following 
months and annual job gains continue to be broad-based 
across sectors and regions . Overall, labour market condi-
tions still suggest a shrinking degree of slack .
Wage growth continued to pick up in the ﬁ rst months of 
2018, rising from 1 .9 per cent in December 2017 to 3 .2 per 
cent in January in the SEPH, and from 2 .6 per cent in the 
fourth quarter of 2017 to 3 .2 per cent in the ﬁ rst quarter 
of 2018 in the LFS . In both cases, the pickup in wage 
growth not only refl ects ongoing absorption of slack but 
also the eﬀ ects of the minimum wage increases in some 
provinces . Wages in Ontario, for example, rose sharply for 

accommodation and food services and were also generally 
higher for youth and part-time workers in some lower-wage 
sectors (Chart 3-A) .
Underlying wage growth continues to improve, rising 
to 2 .7 per cent in the latest estimate, although this rate 
appears to have been boosted somewhat by the impact of 
the minimum wage increases .1 A rate of wage growth of 
about 3 per cent has historically been consistent with an 
economy in which there is no labour market slack and in 
which wages have grown in line with their key determin-
ants: trend labour productivity growth and infl ation .2 The 
estimate of 2 .7 per cent thus suggests that some slack may 
remain or that other factors are restricting wage growth .

Untapped resources in the labour market
Although the level of labour market slack has decreased, 
some indicators continue to suggest that additional 
labour resources are available . For example, the long-term 
unemployment rate is still elevated and the participation 
rate for youth remains low . As labour markets tighten, ﬁ rms 
may respond to strong demand by hiring from this pool of 

1  A preliminary estimate of the wage-common (a measure refl ecting the common 

trend among four data sources), based on available data from the LFS and the 
SEPH, suggests that underlying wage growth was at 2 .7 per cent in the ﬁ rst 
quarter of 2018 . This estimate is up from 2 .3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2017 . 
The history of the wage-common will be published on the Bank’s website starting 
in April 2018 .  

2  Since 1998, on average, labour productivity growth and real wage growth have 

been roughly the same, at 1 .1 per cent .

untapped resources . While national youth participation 
is still below its pre-crisis level, in British Columbia the 
rebound in the youth participation rate as well as ongoing 
interprovincial and international migration have allowed the 
labour supply to expand in response to the strong demand 
for labour (Chart 3-B) . 
In addition, in a period of strong growth, with an increasing 
number of job vacancies and rising wages, workers are more 
willing to leave their position and switch to a higher-paying job 
that better matches their skills and experience . This “churning” 
process contributes to higher economic eﬃ  ciency .3

Other factors constraining wage growth
Labour productivity growth has been somewhat stronger 
than real wage growth in recent quarters, for several possible 
reasons . Wage growth could be constrained by competitive 
pressures from ongoing automation of the economy or from 
oﬀ shoring . Or, workers may have developed a stronger prefer-
ence for job security over wage growth, refl ecting post-crisis 
labour market scarring . Alternatively, wage growth may be fol-
lowing typical cyclical dynamics, suggesting that wage growth 
could be slower than labour productivity growth after a long 
period of excess supply . However, with the caveat that the data 
are quite volatile, real wage growth recently picked up to match 
productivity growth, suggesting that the disinfl ationary eﬀ ect 
related to some of these factors is waning .
Overall, wage growth has continued to increase since 
the January Report, consistent with the absorption of

them close to 2 per cent .

Measures of CPI inflation and core inflation are around 2 per cent, consistent 
with the economy operating close to capacity. Since its trough in the middle 
of 2017, CPI inflation has firmed, as expected, with the absorption of excess 
capacity and the dissipation of some temporary factors.

CPI inflation in the first quarter was higher than anticipated at the time of the 
January Report. The positive surprise was associated with the prices for air 
transportation and semi-durables, and for some services that were affected 
by the higher minimum wage in some provinces (Chart 11). The impact of 
these price shocks on inflation is expected to be temporary. Meanwhile, 
recent monthly fluctuations in CPI inflation have mostly reflected transitory 
movements in gasoline prices.

The Bank’s three preferred measures of core inflation moved up, as 
expected, reflecting diminished downward pressure from excess capacity 
(Chart 12). The pickup in CPI-common since the beginning of 2018 reflects 
in part the impact of the recent minimum wage increases.4

Growth is projected to become more balanced over the 
longer term
The Bank projects that the economy will expand slightly faster than potential 
output over 2018 and 2019, and then grow with potential (Chart 13). The 
composition of growth is expected to gradually shift, with the contribution 
of investment and exports increasing, while that of household spending 
declines.

The economic outlook has been revised up since January to reflect the 
positive implications of stronger potential output growth and recently 
tabled federal and provincial budgets. The Bank estimates that the mea-
sures contained in the new provincial budgets, if enacted, will add about 
0.4 per cent to the level of real GDP by the end of 2020. The macroeco-
nomic impact of the new federal budget on GDP over the projection horizon 
is expected to be similar to that in the January Report, which was based on 
the Fall Economic Statement 2017.5

Higher interest rates and slowing growth in disposable income are expected 
to gradually dampen household spending growth over the projection 
horizon. The pace of expansion of household credit has slowed since last 
summer, indicating that higher interest rates and measures affecting the 
housing market are beginning to have an impact on borrowing behaviour 
(Chart 14 and Chart 15). The projection continues to incorporate a greater 
sensitivity of household spending to interest rate increases when debt levels 
are elevated; this sensitivity will be reassessed over time with incoming data.

In 2018, consumption is expected to continue to contribute significantly to 
growth, supported by elevated consumer confidence and ongoing employ-
ment and wage increases. The contribution of residential investment is 
expected to decline. New construction is forecast to contribute positively, 
particularly in Ontario, where housing demand has been outpacing supply.

However, this is expected to be offset by the softness of resales, which 
should recover only gradually from the contraction at the beginning of the 
year.

In 2019 and 2020, consumption and residential investment growth are both 
expected to moderate. Although the rate of household formation is antici-
pated to remain robust, housing activity is expected to gradually decline 
due to the higher interest rates and the longer-run impact of the housing 
measures. At the same time, consumption and income growth are projected 
to slow in tandem, and the savings rate is therefore anticipated to remain 
largely stable.

Business investment is expected to expand modestly
Although restrained by trade-policy uncertainty and ongoing competitive-
ness challenges, business investment is expected to continue its recovery. 
This expansion should be supported by ongoing increases in foreign and 
domestic demand, rising capacity pressures and positive business senti-
ment (Chart 16). Growth of investment spending is expected to be particu-
larly robust for firms in the service and information technology sectors.

Despite strengthening global demand, growth of business investment in 
export-oriented goods industries is anticipated to be restrained by elevated 
uncertainty around trade policy, regulatory concerns and incentives to shift 
investment to the United States following the US tax reform.6 In the spring 
BOS, some businesses confirmed that these factors are affecting their 
investment decisions.

In the energy sector, which accounts for roughly 20 per cent of business 
investment in Canada, the Bank forecasts that investment will decrease 
in 2018 and remain roughly flat thereafter. Investment in new projects is 
being held back by reduced competitiveness resulting from regulatory 
and US policy changes. Roughly half of Canadian oil production is consi-
dered heavy, with WCS prices serving as the appropriate benchmark. 
Transportation bottlenecks led to a widening of the WTI-WCS spread. Only 
a part of heavy oil production is subject to the full discount in WCS prices, 
however, since some oil producers have integrated refinery operations and

6  As in the January Report, these effects are projected to reduce the level of business investment. 

Estimates for 2018 and 2019 have not changed, but an additional year has been added to the projec-
tion. The base-case scenario incorporates a negative impact on investment of about 3 per cent from 
2017 to the end of 2020 (Box 2). As a result, the level of GDP is about 0.2 per cent lower by the end of 
2020, after accounting for the import content of investment.

dedicated shipping capacity. Nevertheless, relatively low prices for WCS 
and limited pipeline and rail capacity out of Western Canada could discou-
rage longer-term investment in the oil sands.

Export growth is anticipated to rise over the projection
Non-commodity exports are projected to grow at about the rate of foreign 
demand, although they are not expected to recover the ground lost relative 
to global activity and the associated rise in global trade volumes over the 
past several quarters (Chart 17). The steady downtrend in Canada’s share 
of US non-energy goods imports has not slowed despite the depreciation of 
the Canadian dollar in recent years and is indicative of the ongoing compe-
titiveness challenges that some Canadian exporters face (Chart 18). While a 
substantial part of this trend may be explained by the growing importance 
of China in global trade, factors specific to Canada have also played a role. 
Lower vehicle production mandates, which led to a sizable contraction 
in the auto sector, are expected to continue to limit auto sector exports. 
In addition, for some other industries, capacity constraints will restrain 
exports. Exporters participating in the Bank’s spring BOS reported capacity 
constraints and labour shortages, as well as negative effects of protectionism 
on their sales prospects.7

While the level of non-commodity exports has been held back, looking 
ahead, they are expected to expand, boosted by the ongoing strength in 
foreign demand. Exports of a wide range of Canadian goods are expected 
to benefit, including aircraft, medium and heavy trucks, and specialized 
machinery and equipment. Service exports that are expected to benefit

7  Taken together, the spillover effects of trade-policy uncertainty and reduced investment competitive-
ness are anticipated to hold back the level of exports. Estimates for 2018 and 2019 have not changed 
since the January Report, but an additional year has been added to the projection. The base-case 
scenario incorporates a negative impact on exports of about 1 1/2 per cent by the end of 2020 (Box 2). 
As a result, the level of GDP is about 0.3 per cent lower by the end of 2020, after accounting for the 
import content of exports.

include transportation; tourism; and telecommunications, computer and 
information services. In addition, ongoing technological change, especially 
in the digital economy, is expected to continue to drive strong growth of 
related service exports. With their anticipated robust pace of growth, ser-
vice exports should increase as a share of Canadian exports. 

Commodities exports are anticipated to expand at a solid pace given the 
projected expansions of both production and demand, although this growth 
is expected to be constrained by ongoing transportation challenges. 

CPI inflation is expected to be close to 2 per cent
CPI inflation is anticipated to remain modestly above 2 per cent until the end 
of 2018 (Chart 19). Temporary factors, namely elevated gasoline prices and 
the impact of minimum wage increases, are expected to more than offset 
the fading effects of electricity price rebates and low food price inflation. In 
2019, inflation is expected to return to about 2 per cent.

The Bank continues to monitor closely the impact of global and technolo-
gical factors on inflation. To date, their impact on Canadian inflation does 
not appear to be significant.

Relative to January, the projection for CPI inflation in 2018 is revised up 
by 0.3 percentage points, due to higher-than-expected prices for intercity 
transport and semi-durable goods and stronger-than-expected effects of 
the minimum wage increases. The effects of these factors are expected to 
dissipate by early 2019.

This projection is consistent with medium- and long-term inflation expec-
tations remaining well anchored. Most respondents to the BOS anticipate 
that inflation will remain between 1 and 3 per cent over the next two years. 
A little more than half of them now expect inflation to be in the upper half of 
that range, owing to tighter labour markets, higher commodity prices and 
minimum wage increases. The March 2018 Consensus Economics forecast

estimated impact of minimum wage increases.

Sources: Statistics Canada and Bank of Canada estimates, calculations and projections 

for CPI inflation is 2.1 per cent in 2018 and 2.0 per cent in 2019. Responses 
to a quarterly question on long-term inflation expectations show an average 
of 1.9 per cent through 2028.

Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, a reasonable range 
around the base-case projection for CPI inflation is ±0.3 percentage points. 
This range is intended to convey a sense of forecast uncertainty. A com-
plementary perspective is provided using statistical analysis of the Bank’s 
forecast errors, which suggests that a 50 per cent confidence interval 
around the base-case projection widens from ±0.3 percentage points in 
the second quarter of 2018 to ±0.6 percentage points by the end of 2020. 
Over the same period, a 90 per cent confidence band widens from ±0.6 to 
±1.5 percentage points.

RisKs to thE inFlation outlooK  23 

Risks to the inflation outlook

The prospect of a notable shift toward protectionist global trade policies 
remains the most important risk affecting the outlook. While the Bank’s 
base-case scenario incorporates the adverse effects of the associated 
higher uncertainty on firms’ investment and export activities, it otherwise 
assumes that existing trade arrangements will be maintained over the pro-
jection horizon.

Based on this assumption, the Bank assesses that the risks to the projected 
path for inflation are roughly balanced. The evolution of risks since January 
is summarized in Table 4. The risks listed below include several that are 
similar to those identified in January. With the gradual evolution of economic 
conditions in Canada and abroad, the Bank has chosen to highlight an addi-
tional risk.

(i)  Weaker Canadian investment and exports 

Even with a cautious projection for exports, non-energy goods 
exports could disappoint, given ongoing competitiveness challenges 
and limited capacity. Firms may respond to the expansion in foreign 
demand by investing outside Canada rather than investing in and 
exporting from Canada. Such a reallocation would have various nega-
tive effects on the Canadian economy, including lower production 
capacity and lower domestic demand due to reduced employment in 
the export sector.

(ii)  Sharp tightening of global financial conditions

Financial conditions remain broadly accommodative, but could tighten 
suddenly. Heightened trade tensions, a repricing of the future path of 
monetary policy, or a faster pickup in wage and price inflation could 
trigger such a tightening. Tighter financial conditions could manifest 
as a rise in bond yields and potentially disruptive portfolio adjust-
ments. These disruptions could translate into a decline in confidence 
and economic activity (especially in sectors sensitive to interest rates), 
reduced wealth, a rise in debt-service burdens, and weaker global 
and Canadian growth.

(iii)  Stronger real GDP growth in the United States

The outlook for US economic growth has been revised up to reflect 
new government spending. However, growth could be even stronger 
if tax reform and deregulation in the United States trigger “animal 
spirits” in an environment of accommodative financial conditions, 
elevated equity prices and high corporate profits. The resulting boost 
to investment, as well as stronger household spending, would have 
positive implications for Canadian investment and exports.

 

 

24  RisKs to thE inFlation outlooK 

banK oF CanaDa  •  MonEtaRy PoliCy REPoRt  •  aPRil 2018

 

(iv)  Stronger consumption and rising household debt in Canada

Elevated consumer confidence could lead to stronger consumer 
spending than in the base-case projection. The vulnerabilities associ-
ated with household indebtedness would be exacerbated if the addi-
tional spending were financed by additional borrowing.

(v)  A pronounced decline in house prices in overheated markets
While there appears to be some moderation in prices and less specula-
tive demand, a sizable decline in house prices in some markets could 
still be possible. A drop in house prices would likely dampen residential 
investment and consumption.

appendix: Reassessment of 
Canadian Potential 
output Growth

Potential output growth is projected to remain at 1.8 per cent over the projection 
horizon, before increasing to 1.9 per cent in 2021 (Table A-1).8 To analyze the 
forces underpinning this outlook, potential output growth can be divided into 
two components: growth in trend labour input (trend number of hours worked) 
and in trend labour productivity (trend output per hour worked) (Chart A-1).

Population aging is anticipated to further weigh on trend labour input growth 
over the projection horizon, mainly through two channels. First, growth 
in the working-age population is expected to continue to slow, although 
immigration will partly offset this decline. Second, the growth of the trend 
employment rate slows because the share of older workers (those 55+) 
is increasing and their participation rate is lower than prime-age workers 
(those aged 25 to 54). In addition, when they are employed, older workers 
are likely to work fewer hours than prime-age workers.9 Nevertheless, 
relative to the April 2017 reassessment, trend labour input growth is slightly 
higher, reflecting the strong employment gains observed in 2017.

The trough for trend labour productivity growth observed in 2017 suggests 
that the adjustment phase that followed the 2014 decline in commodity 
prices is most likely behind us. Trend labour productivity growth is expected 
to increase to 1.4 per cent in 2021, above its historical average of around 
1.1 per cent. This higher profile, relative to what was expected in the Bank’s 
reassessment in April 2017, stems from two sources. Most of the upward

In contrast, the secular decline in trend average hours worked can be partly attributed to the increase 
in the share of workers employed in the services sector, where the number of hours worked per week 
tends to be lower.

Note: Numbers may not add to total because of rounding. 
Sources: Statistics Canada and Bank of Canada estimates and projections 

revisions to trend labour productivity growth between 2014 and 2018 are 
due to the positive historical revisions to business investment and the 
capital stock for 2014 published by Statistics Canada in November 2017. 
Over the rest of the projection period and up to 2021, a more positive out-
look for investment explains the revisions to trend labour productivity.

Estimates of potential output are imprecise, given the uncertainty around 
the evolution of its components. Productivity, for example, will depend on 
factors that are inherently difficult to forecast. These include such factors as 
structural changes, technological progress and the level and composition of 
investment. To capture this uncertainty, a range is constructed around the 
midpoint estimates.

At this stage in the business cycle, the procyclical effects of increased 
investment and employment gains could lead to higher potential output 
growth than in the base-case scenario. Stronger activity and improved 
labour market conditions, for example, could bring into the labour force 
people from underrepresented segments of the population, from groups 
with lower participation rates and who have been unemployed for a long 
period.

The adoption of new digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence, 
could lead to productivity gains from complementary investments in human 
and organizational capital.10 Digitalization of the economy may also increase 
net firm turnover, or at least mitigate its long-run decline, as some ineffi-
cient firms are replaced by new, more productive digital firms. Firms could 
thus push the technology frontier further by making full use of their digital 
capacity.

Potential output growth could be weaker than in the base case if current 
trade arrangements are disrupted or higher barriers to Canadian exports 
are erected. Such additional restrictions to international trade would reduce

projection and dislocate international supply chains. As well, differences in 
fiscal and regulatory policies between Canada and the United States could 
have a more negative impact on investment, and thus productivity, than is 
currently expected. Moreover, the most recent Statistics Canada survey 
of investment intentions suggests that historical investment data may be 
revised down later this year, which may also lead to downward revisions to 
trend labour productivity growth.11

11  It is possible that the weakness in Canadian business investment since 2015 could be attributable to 

factors that are more structural and less cyclical than previously thought, such as population aging 
or weak productivity performance. See R. Barnett and R. Mendes, “A Structural Interpretation of the 
Recent Weakness in Business Investment,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2017-7 (July 2017).

Canada’s Inflation-Control Strategy1
Inflation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote 

the economic and financial well-being of Canadians.

pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s 
outlook, including risks to the projection, are published four 
times per year in the Monetary Policy Report.

  Canada’s experience with inflation targeting since 1991 has 

shown that the best way to foster confidence in the value 
of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth, 
employment gains and improved living standards is by keeping 
inflation low, stable and predictable.

Inflation targeting is symmetric and flexible
  Canada’s inflation-targeting approach is symmetric, which 

means that the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising 
above or falling below the 2 percent target.

  In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 

Canada’s inflation-control target for a further five-year period, 
ending December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the 
consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 percent midpoint 
of the control range of 1 to 3 percent.

  Canada’s inflation-targeting framework is flexible. Typically, 

the Bank seeks to return inflation to target over a horizon of six 
to eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for 
returning inflation to target will vary depending on the nature 
and persistence of the shocks buffeting the economy.

The monetary policy instrument
  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes in the 

target for the overnight rate of interest.2 These changes are 
transmitted to the economy through their influence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate, 
which affect total demand for Canadian goods and services. 
The balance between this demand and the economy’s 
production capacity is, over time, the primary determinant of 
inflation pressures in the economy.

  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight 
quarters—to work their way through the economy and have 
their full effect on inflation. For this reason, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent com-
munications, the Bank regularly reports its perspective on 
the forces at work on the economy and their implications for 
inflation. The Monetary Policy Report is a key element of this 
approach. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight 

Monitoring inflation
  In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in 
indirect taxes such as GST, can cause sizable fluctuations in 
CPI.

  In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through 

such transitory movements in CPI inflation and focuses on a 
set of “core” inflation measures that better reflect the under-
lying trend of inflation. In this sense, these measures act as an 
operational guide to help the Bank achieve the CPI inflation 
target. They are not a replacement for CPI inflation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core inflation are CPI-
trim, which excludes CPI components whose rates of change 
in a given month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which 
corresponds to the price change located at the 50th percentile 
(in terms of basket weight) of the distribution of price changes; 
and CPI-common, which uses a statistical procedure to track 
common price changes across categories in the CPI basket.

Inflation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide additional  monetary 

stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website, 
describes these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Global Economy

Escalating trade conflicts, geopolitical tensions and related uncertainty are 
contributing to the broad-based slowdown of global economic activity and 
a moderation in the growth of both trade and business investment. Global 
economic growth slowed significantly in recent quarters and is expected to 
fall to 3 percent in 2019, from around 33/4 percent in 2018 (Table 1).

With concerns about a weakening global economy, bond yields and com-
modity prices have fallen. Many central banks have responded to softer 
economic outlooks and weaker inflation expectations by signalling shifts 
toward more accommodative monetary policy.

The global outlook has again been downgraded relative to past reports. The 
drag from trade policies and the related uncertainty is now larger than pre-
viously assumed, although the effect on growth is partially buffered by the 
easing in global financial conditions.

Growth is expected to strengthen somewhat to around 31/4 percent in 
2020 and 2021. The pickup reflects an expected improvement in some 
emerging-market economies (EMEs) as the effects on growth of polit-
ical uncertainty, past monetary policy tightening and oil production cuts 
dissipate.

Global trade and investment have slowed
Trade conflicts between the United States and China are dampening global 
economic activity. Their effects are slowing growth in these two economies 
and spilling over to other countries through trade and investment. Trade 
has slowed sharply, particularly in China and in countries that share supply 
chains with it, including those in emerging Asia and Japan (Chart 1). So far, 
the manufacturing sector globally has experienced most of the slowing, 
although the service sector has also softened in recent months (Chart 2).

The base-case projection includes the effects of recent tariff increases 
imposed by the United States and China.1 It also incorporates drag from 
increased uncertainty associated with concerns that governments may 
undertake additional hostile trade actions. All tariff increases globally over 
the past two years, as well as related uncertainty, are now estimated to 
reduce global gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.6 percent by the end of 
2021, higher than estimated in the April Report.2, 3

There is considerable uncertainty around estimates of the impacts from 
trade policy. Trade conflicts disrupt trade patterns and global value chains 
and negatively affect business investment and income. The costs of reallo-
cating capital and labour across affected industries and countries because 
of the trade war could be larger than assumed in the base-case projection, 
even without further escalation. The effects on confidence and trend labour 
productivity could also be more pronounced.

The retaliatory measures implemented by China in June have been incorporated in the Bank’s current 
projection. At the June 2019 G20 summit in Japan, authorities from the United States and China agreed 
to resume trade talks and to suspend further tariff increases. The base-case projection assumes no 
further tariff increases or other restrictive trade measures.

Bond yields have fallen 
Many central banks have signalled shifts toward more accommodative mon-
etary policy in response to slowing global growth and softening inflation 
expectations. Government bond yields have moved lower, reflecting market 
expectations of monetary policy easing.

Since the end of May, yields of Canadian and US 10-year government bonds 
have dropped below three-month Treasury-bill rates, leading to inverted 
yield curves. Inversions like these may occur more frequently now and be 
less indicative of recessions than they have been historically.4 They nonethe-
less reflect a concern about the prospects for growth. Some asset prices 
have experienced volatility related to trade developments and changing 
market views about monetary policy. However, indicators such as the 
excess bond premium, credit spreads and equity prices suggest that eco-
nomic growth will continue in the near term. Overall, global financial condi-
tions remain highly accommodative.

US growth is expected to moderate toward potential
The US economy grew at a strong pace in the first quarter, a temporary 
interruption to the moderation seen since mid-2018. Growth was supported 
by net exports and inventories, which have been volatile in the face of trade 
actions. Strength in exports and inventories more than offset the weakness 
in household spending that is related, in part, to the temporary effects of the 
federal government shutdown.

Recently, data have been softening, indicating that economic growth likely 
returned to a more sustainable pace in the second quarter. Trade conflicts 
and waning fiscal stimulus are expected to continue weighing on growth. At 
the same time, the tight labour market should support healthy wage gains 
and household spending. Overall, GDP growth is expected to moderate 
toward potential growth of about 13/4 percent over the projection horizon.

curve and other market-based measures.

Core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price inflation decreased to 
around 11/2 percent in recent months, from close to 2 percent at the end of 
2018.5 This decrease largely reflects transitory factors. Market-based infla-
tion expectations have also fallen in recent months (Chart 3).

In this context, the US Federal Reserve has communicated a readiness to 
provide additional monetary stimulus, if necessary, to sustain the expansion. 
These developments have been reflected in market expectations for short-
term interest rates.

Euro area growth and inflation are projected to remain 
modest
Headwinds from political and trade uncertainties continue to dampen busi-
ness sentiment in the euro area. Industrial production has been particularly 
weak, and indicators suggest that GDP growth will soften in the coming 
quarters. The labour market has been performing well, and household 
spending should continue to support growth. Growth is expected to average 
about 11/4 percent in 2019, before rising to close to 11/2 percent in 2020.

Core inflation remains tepid, and inflation expectations have fallen further 
below the 2 percent target of the European Central Bank (ECB). In response, 
the ECB has signalled that its policy rate will likely remain at its current level 
longer than it previously indicated, until at least mid-2020.

5  Core PCE price inflation measures changes in prices for personal consumption expenditures, excluding 

food and energy.

Trade tensions constrain growth in emerging-market 
economies
The trade dispute with the United States continues to constrain economic 
growth in China. Over the past year, China’s export growth has slowed sig-
nificantly. Import growth has become negative, driven by declining imports 
from the United States and from some East Asian countries. The increase 
in tariffs since May, as well as related uncertainty, will likely further weigh on 
the manufacturing sector. Additional policy support should help buffer some 
of these effects, although stimulus could exacerbate financial vulnerabilities.

GDP growth in other oil-importing EMEs is forecast to be markedly weaker 
in 2019 due to a broad-based slowdown. Overall growth in these EMEs will 
likely improve by 2020 as Turkey emerges from recession and as country-
specific challenges dissipate in India and some Latin American countries. 
Nonetheless, the escalation in trade tensions is expected to continue to 
disrupt trade and weigh on growth in emerging Asia over the projection 
horizon.

Economic growth in oil-exporting EMEs slowed somewhat in the first 
quarter due to oil production cuts by some members of the Organization of 
the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Growth is expected to pick up 
over the projection horizon.

Growth concerns are weighing on commodity prices
Escalating trade tensions are affecting many commodity prices (Chart 4). Oil 
prices have fallen since April, despite heightened geopolitical tensions in the 
Middle East and the agreement between OPEC and some non-OPEC oil-
producing countries to extend production cuts until March 2020.

In its projection, the Bank assumes that the prices of Brent and West Texas 
Intermediate (WTI) oil will remain close to their recent average levels, which 
are US$5 lower than assumed in April (Box 1, page 8). Oil prices could 
nevertheless remain volatile given elevated uncertainties in the oil market. 
Prices could be higher if tensions between the United States and Iran 
escalate. However, US oil production has repeatedly exceeded expectations 
in recent months and could continue to do so, which would put downward 
pressure on prices.

The spread between WTI and Western Canadian Select has averaged 
around US$15 recently, up from US$10 in April. This widening reflects the 
easing of the mandatory production curtailments in Alberta.

The Bank’s non-energy commodity price index remains relatively 
unchanged since April. Ongoing challenges in the global manufacturing 
sector are putting downward pressure on base metal prices. Lumber prices, 
meanwhile, have increased from persistently low levels because several 
Canadian sawmills have announced production cuts or permanent closures.

Canadian Economy

Canada’s economy picked up after the slowdown in late 2018 and early 
2019. Global trade conflicts and related uncertainty will nevertheless 
 continue to hold back activity. GDP growth is expected to increase from 
1.3 percent in 2019 to about 2 percent in 2020 and 2021, slightly above 
potential growth (Table 2, Box 1).

Growth in the economy is expected to be broad-based over the projection 
horizon. While the oil sector continues to undergo significant adjustment, 
investment in this sector is forecast to stabilize by 2020, and its exports 
should gradually increase. In other sectors, investment and exports are pro-
jected to expand at a moderate pace. Consumer spending is expected to 
grow steadily, supported by sustained income gains and solid consumer 
confidence. At the national level, residential investment appears to have sta-
bilized and is expected to contribute modestly to growth in 2020 and 2021.

The rebound in growth in the second quarter is now estimated to have been 
stronger than anticipated in the April Report, while the longer-term outlook is 
down slightly. Escalating global trade conflicts and geopolitical tensions are 
contributing to increased uncertainty, weighing more heavily on business 
sentiment in Canada and around the world. The outlook for foreign demand 
is softer, and commodity prices are lower. In addition, China has imposed 
further trade restrictions on Canada. In 2020, the negative impacts of these 
factors slightly outweigh the positive. Notably, US tariffs on Canadian steel 
and aluminum and associated countermeasures have been lifted, and there 
has been progress toward the ratification of the Canada-United States-
Mexico Agreement. As well, borrowing costs have eased and population 
growth has been stronger than anticipated.

Consistent with an economy that, outside the oil-producing regions, 
appears to have been operating close to potential, core inflation measures 
have been hovering near 2 percent. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation is 
expected to fluctuate over the next year, largely because of movements in 
gasoline prices, and then remain close to target.

After two quarters of weakness, economic activity has 
strengthened
Real GDP grew by 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 2019, in line with the 
April Report. It was the second consecutive quarter of weak GDP growth, 
marked by contractions in goods-producing industries, notably oil and 
gas and construction (Chart 5). Residential investment declined further, 
as housing activity continued to adjust to changes in housing market poli-
cies and past increases in borrowing rates. In contrast, consumer spending 
rebounded after weakness in the last two quarters of 2018. Business invest-
ment registered unexpectedly strong gains, resulting from a temporary 
surge in spending on imported aircraft and other transportation equipment.

support activities for both the mining and quarrying of minerals and the extraction of oil and gas.

The Bank estimates that economic growth over the second and third quar-
ters of 2019 will average close to growth of potential output (Table 3 and 
Chart 6). The economy appears to have been stronger in the second quarter 
than it is expected to be in the third. Activity in the second quarter was likely 
boosted by temporary factors, including a surge in energy exports and a 
payback from weather-related softness in the first quarter. 

On average, over the second and third quarters, the contribution to growth 
from exports is expected to be robust, while the contribution from inven-
tories is anticipated to be moderately negative. Crude oil exports likely 
increased with some easing of oil production curtailments in Alberta and 
increased shipments of oil by rail. In addition, with the removal of tariffs 
on steel and aluminum, non-energy commodity exports should expand. 
However, restrictive trade actions by China against imports of canola and 
meat produced in Canada are estimated to reduce Canadian exports by 
about 0.2 percent.

Despite global developments, recent data and results from the summer 
Business Outlook Survey provide reassuring signs that business sentiment 
and investment in Canada are improving (Chart 7). Large purchases of air-
craft and automobile fleets drove quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in invest-
ment in the first half of 2019. On average, however, business investment has 
been expanding and is expected to continue to do so, even though capital 
spending in the oil and gas sector should continue to decline in the near 
term.

Elevated consumer confidence, solid gains in labour income and climate 
action incentive payments from the federal government should support 
household spending. Consumption is expected to grow moderately in both 
the second and third quarters, although auto sales are likely to remain 
roughly flat.

Last observation: 2019Q2 

Household imbalances, as measured by the ratio of household debt to 
income, have stabilized, and mortgage stress testing has improved the 
quality of mortgage borrowing. Lower mortgage interest rates are providing 
some support to housing demand. The Bank estimates that growth in resi-
dential investment resumed in the second quarter, with a strong rebound in 
housing resales. In addition, new construction activity is anticipated to firm 
up in the third quarter. The federal government’s new shared-equity mort-
gage program is expected to provide some additional support for housing 
activity later in the year.

Housing market conditions continue to differ across regions. In Halifax, 
Montréal and Ottawa, housing markets have strengthened, with solid 
resales and new construction activity accompanied by moderate increases 
in house prices. While adjustment has been more difficult in the greater 
Toronto and Vancouver areas because of past speculative activity in these 
markets, expectations of house price growth have been declining. Signs 
of improvement have emerged in Toronto, where resales and prices have 
increased recently; however, in Vancouver, the level of resales remains low 
and prices are still falling. Meanwhile, ongoing challenges in the oil industry 
continue to weigh on the outlook for new construction in Alberta.

The economy has a modest degree of excess supply
The Canadian economy was operating near capacity for most of 
2017 and 2018. Taking the recent weakness into account, the Bank esti-
mates that the output gap was between -1.25 and -0.25 percent in the 
second quarter of 2019 (Box 1). Consistent with this assessment, indica-
tors of capacity pressures and labour shortages in the summer Business 
Outlook Survey are below the levels reached in 2018, as in the spring survey. 
Because the recent slowdown in activity was more concentrated in some 
regions and industries, economic slack is not pervasive.

The Canadian labour market continues to be healthy. The unemployment 
rate stands near its all-time low, and the participation rate of prime-age 
workers is near its historical high. Job creation has been robust—a sign 
that slow growth in recent quarters was temporary (Chart 8). While employ-
ment gains have been relatively broad-based across sectors and regions, 
they were particularly strong in service industries and outside oil-producing 
regions.

Monthly data indicate that wage gains are increasing with the overall 
strength in the labour market.6 Growth of the Bank’s composite measure of 
wages, wage-common, is estimated to have increased to almost 2½ percent 
in the second quarter, up from about 2 percent in the first quarter.7 Regional 
differences continued to be evident in the first-quarter wage data: in oil- 
producing regions, wage gains were about half a percentage point lower 
than in other regions.

Core inflation measures remain near 2 percent (Chart 9). The Bank esti-
mates that CPI inflation was 2.1 percent in the second quarter of 2019, in line 
with the April forecast (Table 3). CPI inflation is expected to fall temporarily 
in the third quarter, to 1.6 percent, with the decline reflecting gasoline price 
dynamics, the removal of tariff countermeasures and volatility in airfare.

6  Structural factors, such as population aging, may be dampening measured wage growth. Population 

aging may have reduced aggregate annual wage growth by about 0.1 percentage point on average 
since 2007. As the share of older workers increased, average wage growth was lower because 
wage growth of older workers was slower than that of prime-age workers. In addition, average wage 
growth was reduced because higher-paid retiring individuals were replaced in aggregate with lower-
paid workers. For details, see O. Kostyshyna and C. Luu, “Demographics and Wages: A Microdata 
Perspective” (forthcoming).

7  The second quarter estimate of wage-common draws on wage data for April from the Survey of 

Employment, Payrolls and Hours and wage data for April, May and June from the Labour Force Survey.

Economic growth is expected to return to around 
potential
The Bank forecasts that economic growth will strengthen to slightly above 
potential in 2020 and 2021 (Table 2). In the base-case projection, consump-
tion expands moderately, housing recovers, and the combined contribution 
of exports and business investment improves. Global trade conflicts and 
related uncertainty are the main headwinds to growth in the forecast.

The federal government’s recent approval of the Trans Mountain Pipeline 
is a positive development for the oil and gas sector. Related construc-
tion activity should begin later this summer. However, the pipeline is not 
expected to be available for oil transportation until 2022, beyond the projec-
tion horizon.

Exports are projected to improve
Exports are forecast to grow moderately over the projection horizon, sup-
ported by the ongoing expansion of foreign demand (Chart 10). However, 
competitiveness challenges and the uncertainty surrounding global trade 
policy will likely continue to weigh on exports. The Bank assumes that trade 
policy uncertainty dampens the level of exports, by about 1.5 percent by 
the end of 2021, somewhat more than noted in the April Report.8 The Bank 
judges that positive effects on business sentiment of developments in 
Canada–US trade policy are outweighed by rising global trade tensions.

Non-commodity exports are projected to grow, except for those in the 
auto sector. Auto sector exports are expected to decline over the projec-
tion horizon, in part reflecting changes to production mandates of Canadian 
motor vehicle assemblers. Exports of services should continue to expand 
at a strong pace, leading to a further increase in the sector’s share of non-
commodity exports. Non-energy commodity exports are expected to 

8  This assumption is equivalent to a reduction in the level of exports of about $10 billion.

rebound from the weakness experienced in the first quarter of 2019. They 
should grow moderately over the projection horizon, with some support 
from the removal of the steel and aluminum tariffs.9

Energy exports are expected to be roughly flat in 2019 and to grow moder-
ately over 2020 and 2021. In the coming quarters, production and exports 
of oil will continue to be influenced by Alberta’s production curtailments 
and transportation capacity constraints in Western Canada. Mandated cur-
tailments are expected to be phased out later than was anticipated in the 
April Report, and the Enbridge Line 3 replacement program has been fur-
ther delayed. Shipments of crude oil by rail, expected to remain the marginal 
mode of transportation for oil exports, are anticipated to expand.10

Import growth in 2019 is held down by past weakness in investment and 
the significant drop in vehicle production. Import growth in 2020 and 2021 
evolves along with growth of business investment and exports.

Growth in business investment is limited by trade 
tensions
Capacity constraints in meeting growing demand, trends to improve effi-
ciency through digitalization, government incentives and low financing 
costs should support strengthening business investment, despite elevated 
trade policy uncertainty. Firms responding to the summer Business Outlook 
Survey reported intentions to increase investment, with some planning to 
invest in productivity-enhancing equipment.

9  Box 2 in the July 2018 Monetary Policy Report examined the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs 
imposed by the United States on Canadian exports as well as that of Canadian countermeasures. In 
line with this analysis, the removal of the steel and aluminum tariffs is expected to boost the level of 
exports by 0.6 percent over the projection horizon relative to the April Report.

10  Crude-by-rail shipments are expected to reach about 550,000 barrels per day by the end of 2021.

Sources: Statistics Canada and Bank of Canada calculations and projections

Over the projection horizon, the Bank expects investment outside the oil and 
gas sector to expand at a solid pace (Chart 11). In particular, large trans-
portation construction projects, such as the liquefied natural gas terminal in 
British Columbia and the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion, are anticipated 
to boost spending. The forecast for investment would be stronger, however, 
were it not for elevated trade policy uncertainty. The effect on the level of 
business investment is about 3 percent by the end of 2021.11 This markdown 
is larger than in the April Report.

Investment in the oil and gas sector is projected to contract further in 2019 
and to stabilize in 2020 and 2021. This decrease brings the level of invest-
ment to about 20 percent lower than its 2017 level and follows a decline 
in investment spending of about 50 percent between 2014 and 2016. The 
Bank’s consultations with firms in the energy sector suggest that transpor-
tation constraints and production curtailments continue to weigh heavily 
on sentiment in Western Canada and are limiting firms’ access to credit. 
Meanwhile, Newfoundland and Labrador’s offshore oil sector is buoyed by 
new projects and strength in upcoming exploration activity.

Income gains should underpin moderate household 
spending growth
The projection for consumption and housing is supported by sustained 
wage gains and strong employment, partly due to growth of the working-
age population resulting from increased immigration. Nevertheless, house-
holds are expected to be cautious in their spending decisions in the face 
of elevated levels of debt. Consumer spending is anticipated to grow mod-
erately over the projection horizon, and the savings rate is expected to 
increase gradually, helping ease household vulnerabilities.

11  This assumption is equivalent to a reduction in the level of investment of about $8 billion. 

 

 

16 

 

CanaDian EConoMy 
banK oF CanaDa  •  MonEtaRy PoliCy REPoRt  •  July 2019

Residential investment is projected to expand at a modest pace in 
2020 and 2021, after two years of decline. The dampening effects on growth 
of changes in housing policies are expected to fade over the projection 
horizon. In addition, the lower mortgage rates and an immigration-boosted 
pace of household formation should support housing activity.

CPI inflation is expected to be close to 2 percent
The Bank forecasts CPI inflation to decrease temporarily to 1.8 percent in 
2019 before returning to about 2 percent in 2020 and 2021 (Table 2). Inflation 
for 2019 is revised down from the April Report because of the lower assump-
tion for the price of oil and the removal by Canada of countermeasures 
against the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by the United States. The 
effects of these two factors on inflation are likely to persist for about one 
year.

Apart from the temporary deviations associated with movements in gaso-
line prices, airfare and the removal of tariffs, CPI inflation is projected to be 
close to 2 percent. Over the projection horizon, economic slack is expected 
to be a source of modest downward pressure on inflation that is largely 
offset by a small boost from federal carbon pollution charges (Chart 12). 
Because economic slack is concentrated in a few regions, the impact on 
inflation may be less than would be expected if it were uniform across the 
country.

The base-case projection provides the Bank’s view of the most likely out-
come for inflation, although any projection is subject to considerable 
uncertainty. Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, a 
reasonable range around the projection for CPI inflation is ±0.3 percentage 
points. A complementary perspective is provided using statistical analysis 
of the Bank’s forecast errors, which suggests that a 50 percent confidence 
interval around the base-case projection widens from ±0.2 percentage 
points in the third quarter of 2019 to ±0.6 percentage points by the end of 
2021. Over the same period, a 90 percent confidence band widens from 
±0.6 to ±1.4 percentage points.

The projection is consistent with medium- and long-term inflation expecta-
tions remaining well anchored. Almost all firms participating in the Business 
Outlook Survey anticipate that inflation will remain within the Bank’s 
target range of 1 to 3 percent over the next two years. Most respondents 
expect inflation to be in the bottom half of the target range. The May 2019 
Consensus Economics forecast for CPI inflation is 1.8 percent in 2019 and 
2.0 percent in 2020. Responses to a quarterly question on long-term infla-
tion expectations show an average of 1.9 percent through 2029.

RisKs to thE inFlation outlooK  19 

Risks to the inflation outlook

The most important risks to the Canadian economy are related to global 
trade policies and associated uncertainty. Because protectionist trade poli-
cies can disrupt trade flows and global value chains, they can simultan-
eously lower output and put upward pressure on prices. In this sense, they 
can be thought of as negative supply shocks that imply a difficult trade-off 
for monetary policy. In particular, monetary policy cannot simultaneously 
provide support to economic activity and act to contain upward price pres-
sures. The trade-off could be further complicated if the negative supply 
shock resulted in a lower neutral rate of interest. 

Because the Bank’s base-case scenario incorporates the adverse effects 
of announced tariffs and elevated uncertainty, trade policy risks are two-
sided. If current trade disputes were resolved and increases in tariffs intro-
duced over the past couple of years were reversed, economic activity 
would be stronger. The impact on inflation would depend on whether upside 
pressures from stronger demand were larger or smaller than downward 
adjustments to prices associated with lower tariffs. However, the impact of 
increasing protectionism, if it were to occur, could be a significant negative 
supply shock. The negative effects on economic activity could be very large 
and, in the near-term, would be accompanied by increases in inflation due to 
the higher tariffs. While a wide range of outcomes are possible, in the con-
text of persistent trade conflict, it is useful to consider two extreme scen-
arios to illustrate the forces that come into play (Box 2).

Aside from trade policy, the Bank assesses that upside and downside risks 
to the projected path for inflation are roughly balanced. As in past reports, 
the focus is on a selection of risks identified as the most important, drawing 
from a larger set of risks. Table 4 summarizes the evolution of the key risks 
since the previous report.

(i)  Stronger real GDP growth in the United States ()

The recent pickup in labour productivity growth and the decline in 
inflation expectations could indicate that potential output growth in 
the United States is higher than estimated. It is also possible that the 
United States could enact additional fiscal stimulus measures to avoid 
a material decline in growth in 2020. In both cases, Canadian invest-
ment and exports would benefit from stronger US activity.

(ii)  Sharp tightening of global financial conditions ()

Financial conditions could tighten suddenly with an increase in gov-
ernment bond yields or a repricing of corporate credit. The tightening 
of financial conditions could be triggered by higher inflation expecta-
tions in a major advanced economy. Inflation expectations could 
increase if actual inflation were higher than markets forecast, perhaps 
reflecting the effects of tariffs. These developments could translate 
into higher interest rates, a rise in debt-service burdens, a decline in 
activity in sectors sensitive to interest rates and weaker global and 
Canadian economic growth.

(iii)  Stronger consumption and rising household debt in Canada 

( and )
Elevated consumer confidence and solid labour income growth could 
lead to stronger consumption over the projection horizon if consumers 
save less than projected in the base case. However, the vulnerabilities 
associated with indebtedness would be exacerbated if the additional 
spending were financed by more borrowing. This would worsen the 
impact of an adverse shock in the longer term.

(iv)  Weaker growth in China and lower commodity prices ()
In China, the ongoing structural adjustment to rebalance sources of 
economic growth, combined with the trade conflict, could trigger a 
more significant slowdown than anticipated. Moreover, additional 
policy stimulus to support near-term growth could exacerbate finan-
cial vulnerabilities if it led to an increase in leverage. Heightened 
financial vulnerabilities could limit future policy options, posing an 
additional risk to growth. Weaker demand from China would depress 
global demand and commodity prices, negatively affecting Canadian 
investment and trade.

(v)  More pronounced housing weakness in Canada ()

While recent data suggest that the housing market has begun to 
stabilize, a further drop in activity remains a risk, particularly in the 
greater Vancouver and Toronto areas and in Alberta. More pro-
nounced weakness in residential investment could put additional 
downward pressure on house prices, resulting in mutually reinforcing 
declines in house prices, housing resales and construction.

Canada’s Inflation-Control Strategy1
Inflation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote 

the economic and financial well-being of Canadians.

pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s 
outlook, including risks to the projection, are published four 
times per year in the Monetary Policy Report.

  Canada’s experience with inflation targeting since 1991 has 

shown that the best way to foster confidence in the value 
of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth, 
employment gains and improved living standards is by keeping 
inflation low, stable and predictable.

Inflation targeting is symmetric and flexible
  Canada’s inflation-targeting approach is symmetric, which 

means that the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising 
above or falling below the 2 per cent target.

  In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 

Canada’s inflation-control target for a further five-year period, 
ending December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the 
consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 per cent midpoint 
of the control range of 1 to 3 per cent.

  Canada’s inflation-targeting framework is flexible. Typically, 

the Bank seeks to return inflation to target over a horizon of six 
to eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for 
returning inflation to target will vary depending on the nature 
and persistence of the shocks buffeting the economy.

The monetary policy instrument
  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes in the 

target for the overnight rate of interest.2 These changes are 
transmitted to the economy through their influence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate, 
which affect total demand for Canadian goods and services. 
The balance between this demand and the economy’s 
production capacity is, over time, the primary determinant of 
inflation pressures in the economy.

  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight 
quarters—to work their way through the economy and have 
their full effect on inflation. For this reason, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent com-
munications, the Bank regularly reports its perspective on 
the forces at work on the economy and their implications for 
inflation. The Monetary Policy Report is a key element of this 
approach. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight 

Monitoring inflation
  In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in 
indirect taxes such as GST, can cause sizable fluctuations in 
CPI.

  In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through 

such transitory movements in CPI inflation and focuses on a 
set of “core” inflation measures that better reflect the under-
lying trend of inflation. In this sense, these measures act as an 
operational guide to help the Bank achieve the CPI inflation 
target. They are not a replacement for CPI inflation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core inflation are CPI-
trim, which excludes CPI components whose rates of change 
in a given month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which 
corresponds to the price change located at the 50th percentile 
(in terms of basket weight) of the distribution of price changes; 
and CPI-common, which uses a statistical procedure to track 
common price changes across categories in the CPI basket.

1  See Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target (October 24, 2016) and Renewal of the 

Inflation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide additional  monetary 

stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website, 
describes these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Global Economy

The outlook for global economic growth remains solid. In the United States, 
consumer spending and business investment are expected to stay strong. 
While protectionism remains a threat globally, the proposed new trade 
agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico will reduce 
some of the trade policy uncertainty within North America. In other regions, 
growth is healthy, although risks have risen in some emerging-market 
economies (EMEs) and China. The Bank expects that the global economy 
will grow by about 33/4 per cent in 2018, before moderating to around 
31/2 per cent in 2019 (Table 1).

The global economic outlook would be even stronger without US–China 
trade tensions and the related uncertainty. Trade tensions are weighing on 
some commodity prices and have likely contributed to slower global trade 
and investment growth (Chart 1). The Bank’s projection includes the adverse 
effects of uncertainty on investment and the impact of recent and previously 
implemented tariffs by the United States and other countries. The total drag 
is currently estimated to reduce the level of global gross domestic product 
(GDP) by 0.3 per cent by the end of 2020.

However, the fallout from trade tensions is difficult to predict and could be 
more severe than what is included in the projection (Box 1). The effects of 
trade actions can build on each other in unexpected ways, and new meas-
ures could have a disproportionately large impact.

Last observation: 2018Q2

The potential impact of US–China trade tensions
Rising trade tensions between the United States and China 
could have a signiﬁ cant and lasting impact on the global 
economy . So far in 2018, the United States has targeted 
around US$250 billion of imports from China with new tariﬀ s . 
US authorities have also signalled that both the tariﬀ  rate and 
coverage of items could increase . China has responded with 
tariﬀ s targeting around US$110 billion of US exports .
The escalation in tensions is expected to lead to price dis-
tortions and lower levels of economic activity in both the 
United States and China . To quantify the impact on the out-
look, the Bank ﬁ rst produced estimates informed by inter-
nally available models . Judgment was applied to account 
for channels of transmission that may be missing because 
the eﬀ ects of the tariﬀ s are too complex for models to fully 
capture all of them . If the tariﬀ s are permanent, the Bank 
estimates that the direct impacts of the tariﬀ s will reduce 
the levels of US and Chinese real GDP by 0 .2 and 0 .5 per 
cent, respectively, by the end of 2020 .1 The overall level of 
US consumer prices is estimated to be up to 0 .2 per cent 
higher if the tariﬀ s are fully passed through to consumers, 
with larger impacts on goods and services directly targeted 
by the tariﬀ s .2

1  Government spending is not assumed to increase in response to the higher rev-

enues from tariﬀ s .

2  Exchange rate and other adjustments could lessen this impact .

Considerable uncertainty around these estimates remains . 
The adjustment costs of tariﬀ -induced changes could be 
large, and their timing is diﬃ  cult to predict . As well, the 
estimates do not include the potentially large costs of reallo-
cating capital and labour across aﬀ ected industries and 
countries . Nor do they include any eﬀ ects on trend produc-
tivity or conﬁ dence .

The eff ects of spillovers to other countries are 
complex
While the net global impact will be negative, country-speciﬁ c 
spillovers are uncertain . The uncertainty stems from the 
possibility of both positive and negative spillovers . In addi-
tion to ﬁ nancial market links, spillovers could occur through 
four channels:
•  Softer US and Chinese growth . Lower output and 

incomes reduce their demand for imports from other 
countries .

•  Weaker commodity prices . Weaker economic activity 
in the United States and China could also weigh on the 
demand for commodities, leading to lower prices . The 
drag could lead to a positive terms-of-trade shock for 
commodity importers and a negative shock for com-
modity exporters .

Box 1 (continued)

•  Trade and investment diversion . Barriers between the 
United States and China could shift trade and invest-
ment toward other countries .

•  Higher prices along global value chains (GVCs) . Prices 
could rise in other countries on imports made in GVCs 
with stages of production in the United States and China .
For Canada, the net eﬀ ect included in the Bank’s projection 
is negative, but small . Softer demand in the United States 
and weaker commodity prices will likely outweigh the bene-
ﬁ ts of trade diversion, which may take time to materialize . 
Canadian exports are not close substitutes for many of the 
aﬀ ected products, and spare capacity among non-energy 
exporters is limited . While the prices of some imports from 
the United States are likely to be higher, lower prices of 
commodities provide an oﬀ set .
The fallout for the global economy could be more severe 
than expected:
•  Global investment, trade and productivity experienced 

strong growth with China’s integration into the international 
trade system and the unbundling of production and expan-
sion of GVCs that resulted . Higher costs for intermediate 
goods may disrupt these value chains, lowering exports 
and driving up input prices . If severe enough, this could 
result in a reorganization of GVC activity across countries 
or within national borders . Such a reorganization could hurt 
productivity globally, lead to higher prices for manufactured 
goods, and involve a diﬃ  cult and lengthy reallocation of 
workers and resources across industries .

•  Most of the tariﬀ s are on intermediate goods used by 

businesses and capital imports . Higher costs for capital 
imports directly raise the cost of investment in both 
economies .

•  Spillovers could trigger other risks, notably in emerging-
market economies already facing tighter ﬁ nancial condi-
tions . Tensions could further undermine investor conﬁ -
dence and contribute to a broader slowdown in growth .
Infl ationary pressures could rise globally through both 
the direct price increases from tariﬀ s and the reorgan-
ization of supply chains . Output declines may have a 
depressing eﬀ ect on prices, but this eﬀ ect may materialize 
more slowly .

• 

In turn, these changes could reduce long-term growth and 
prosperity globally .
Chinese authorities also face complicated policy trade-oﬀ s 
if tensions continue to escalate . More ﬁ scal or credit easing 
could work against ongoing eﬀ orts to reduce ﬁ nancial 
sector risks . More depreciation of the exchange rate could 
help buﬀ er a future shock to China’s exports, but could 
also put pressure on capital controls . Targeted actions have 
fewer trade-oﬀ s and may help protect China’s economy 
against the diversion of trade or investment to other coun-
tries . Chinese authorities have taken steps in this direction, 
including tax cuts for exporters and reduced tariﬀ s on some 
imports .

The US expansion remains robust
The US economy has expanded at a rapid pace in recent months, with fiscal 
stimulus contributing to growth that is stronger than potential. Consumption 
and business investment have been robust, supported by a tight labour 
market (Chart 2). Wage growth has been moderate but is steadily rising. 
Exports surged in the second quarter, likely benefiting from a temporary 
boost ahead of tariffs imposed by China. Meanwhile, supply constraints and 
declining affordability continue to hold back residential investment growth.

The outlook includes more drag on business investment than in the July 
Monetary Policy Report due to new US–China tariffs (Box 1). US busi-
nesses are reporting that trade policy uncertainty is dampening investment, 
although these effects are not yet evident in the data. Tariffs put in place 
over the past year are leading to higher prices on some products.

The US economy is forecast to grow by around 3 per cent in 2018 and 
21/2 per cent in 2019, above its potential growth rate. Consumption is antici-
pated to rise at a healthy pace, underpinned by strong job gains and income 
tax cuts. The profile for consumption is consistent with a roughly flat pro-
jection for the savings rate of around 7 per cent. Solid private demand is 
expected to drive robust investment growth, helped by corporate tax cuts.

Growth is forecast to moderate to around 11/2 per cent in 2020, a pace that 
is closer to potential. This cooling is expected to help keep core inflation 
from going much above 2 per cent. The Federal Open Market Committee’s 
median projection is consistent with a gradual rise in the Federal Reserve’s 
policy rate. A gradual path reduces the likelihood of a more sudden repricing 
of financial risk and tightening financial conditions.1

Moderate growth is expected in the euro area
Growth in the euro area was weaker than expected over the first half 
of 2018. Exports were one source of drag on growth, partly because of 
temporary factors, including a past appreciation of the euro. Domestic 
demand, meanwhile, is healthy, and the labour market continues to improve. 
Euro area growth should ease from around 2 per cent in 2018 to about 
11/2 per cent in 2020 as monetary policy becomes less accommodative and 
capacity becomes constrained. Core inflation is still tepid and is anticipated 
to rise only gradually.

Political developments remain a source of downside risk. The Bank’s base 
case continues to assume an orderly Brexit, with some modest negative 
effects from uncertainty. There is risk to this assumption, given that no deal 
is in place yet. In Italy, a planned increase in fiscal spending has driven a rise 
in the spread between Italian and benchmark bond yields.

Financial markets are reacting to US strength and EME risks
While financial conditions remain accommodative in most countries, they 
should become less so as advanced economies gradually remove mon-
etary policy stimulus. The Federal Reserve recently raised its policy rate 
and, in October, the European Central Bank reduced its asset purchases 

1  For instance, there are questions about the financial stability implications of rising issuance of loans 

that are covenant-lite.

(quantitative easing). Globally, bond yields have mostly risen since July, 
largely in parallel across the short and long ends of the yield curve. Earlier 
this year, some analysts expressed concern about whether a flattening of 
the yield curve signals a downturn in the US economy. However, a broader 
set of market-based measures suggests continued, though somewhat 
slower, growth in the near term (Box 2).

As advanced economies withdraw monetary policy stimulus, there could 
be more rebalancing across asset classes. In this context, volatility has 
increased in a number of asset classes since July. EMEs are particularly 
vulnerable to tighter global liquidity, given a rise in debt levels denominated 
in US dollars in recent years. A further appreciation of the US dollar since 
July has added to these pressures. Financial market stress has been acute 
in EMEs with elevated levels of foreign currency debt and that have weak 
monetary policy frameworks (Chart 3). There has been some further finan-
cial tightening in other EMEs since July, but few signs of large-scale capital 
outflows. A further escalation of trade tensions, wage and inflation surprises, 
or a sharp rise in oil prices could lead to an even faster tightening of global 
financial conditions than that included in the Bank’s projection.

Box 2

What the yield curve is telling us about the economic outlook
In the past, some market indicators have been considered 
useful for predicting recessions . Notably, when yields on 
long-term government bonds are lower than those on bonds 
of a shorter maturity (an inversion of the yield curve), a 
recession often follows . In the United States, the yield curve 
has inverted ahead of every recession since the mid-1960s .
In Canada, the yield curve also has some predictive value, 
but it is less reliable than in the United States . Over the 
same period, around 40 per cent of the occurrences of an 
inverted yield curve have not been followed by a recession 
in Canada . This is likely due to the strong infl uence of global 
factors on Canadian long-term yields .
The yield curve has not inverted in either the United States 
or Canada since 2008, with long-term rates currently well 
above short-term rates (Chart 2-A) . If an inversion were 
to happen, it should be interpreted with caution and con-
sidered in tandem with other indicators . While the term 
premium has risen recently, it is currently low, refl ecting 
long-run factors such as modest infl ation volatility and 
cyclical pressures . Central bank quantitative easing pro-
grams and strong private demand for safe assets may also 
be weighing on longer-dated bond yields . These factors 
could have a fl attening eﬀ ect on the yield curve and may 
have reduced the value of the information it signals . A lower 
term premium may also suggest that it would be easier for 
the yield curve to invert now than in the past .
Other measures suggest that economic growth will 
continue in the near term . These include indicators less

infl uenced by the term premium, such as credit spreads 
and spreads between yields of shorter maturities . They also 
include measures with good forecasting power for future 
economic activity, such as the excess bond premium .1

Last observation: October 19, 2018

The outlook is weaker in certain emerging-market 
economies
While financial stress has intensified in Argentina and Turkey, growth in 
most EMEs was generally better than expected over the first half of 2018. 
On net, growth in oil-importing EMEs is now forecast to be weaker than pro-
jected in July, softening to around 4 per cent in 2019 before recovering to 
around 41/2 per cent in 2020. It is assumed in the forecast that financial con-
tagion remains limited, although it is still a risk. Growth in oil-exporting coun-
tries is projected to rise, given higher oil prices and less drag from fiscal 
consolidation.

China’s growth is slowing
Policy support is expected to keep China’s growth in line with official tar-
gets, although downside risks have increased. Past steps to reduce finan-
cial vulnerabilities have slowed credit growth, but are likely dampening 
economic growth. Rising trade tensions with the United States are also 
expected to weigh on exports and investment. Early possible signs of these 
effects include a softening in surveys of new export orders. In this con-
text, authorities have announced new fiscal and credit stimulus that should 
counter some of the expected drag. A weaker renminbi should also offset 
some of the effects of tariffs on export growth. Growth is forecast to ease 
from around 61/2 per cent in 2018 to around 6 per cent in 2020, somewhat 
softer than in the July projection and just below the rate of potential output 
growth.

Trade concerns are weighing on non-energy commodity 
prices
The recent average for the price of Brent oil, the global benchmark, is 
US$5 per barrel higher than assumed in the July Report (Box 3, page 12). 
The increase primarily reflects supply declines in Iran and Venezuela. 
Meanwhile, the spread between West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western 
Canada Select (WCS) has widened. Demand for WCS from US refineries 
has dropped, since maintenance shutdowns began earlier in the year and 
have been more widespread than usual. The effect on the price differen-
tial is being amplified by a faster expansion of oil sands production than of 
transportation capacity. The WTI–WCS spread will likely narrow in the near 
term as some temporary headwinds are resolved. The spread will likely 
remain volatile, however, given that it will take time to address transportation 
constraints.

Risks to global oil prices are balanced around current levels. There could be 
greater-than-expected compliance with US sanctions on Iranian oil exports, 
and Venezuelan output could drop even lower. The Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) may also be less able to fully offset 
production declines than in the past. However, concerns about the impacts 
of trade disputes on the global outlook could weigh more heavily on prices.

The Bank’s non-energy commodity price index is around 10 per cent lower 
than in July. Worries over growth in China are pulling down prices for base 
metals (Chart 4). Tariffs levied by China and Mexico against the United 
States have also put downward pressure on some agricultural prices since 
July. In addition, lumber prices have fallen, reflecting lower-than-expected 
US housing demand. Overall, the drop in WCS and non-energy commodity 
prices is weighing on Canada’s terms of trade.

Canadian Economy

Economic growth in Canada is tracking close to potential, and its compos-
ition is now more balanced than last year (Table 2 and Table 3). Inflation is 
expected to remain within the target range and move toward 2 per cent over 
the projection horizon.

The Canadian economy will be supported by solid growth in both foreign 
and domestic demand and continuing favourable financial conditions. Firms 
are expected to invest to alleviate capacity pressures and improve produc-
tivity. The completion of negotiations toward a new United States-Mexico-
Canada Agreement (USMCA) is encouraging, because it has reduced trade 
policy uncertainty and the associated drag on business investment and 
exports. However, the recent declines in commodity prices and the terms of 
trade are forecast to have a modest negative effect on investment. Exports 
are anticipated to expand at a moderate pace, restrained by ongoing com-
petitiveness challenges and limited transportation capacity. Meanwhile, 
households continue to adjust to higher interest rates and changes to mort-
gage underwriting guidelines. Consumption is expected to grow at a healthy 
pace, supported by rising wages. The boost to income from a larger popu-
lation is more than offset by the negative consequences of weaker terms of 
trade.

real GDP growth was available at the time the projection was conducted. This is why quarter-over-
quarter percentage changes are not presented past that horizon. For longer horizons, fourth-quarter-
over-fourth-quarter percentage changes are presented.

Consumer price index (CPI) inflation has risen in recent months by more 
than was anticipated in the July Report. Inflation reached 2.7 per cent in the 
third quarter of 2018, but is expected to fall back to near 2 per cent by the 
end of the first quarter of 2019 as the effects of temporary factors, notably 
related to airfares, gasoline prices and minimum wages, dissipate. The 
Bank’s measures of core inflation remain near 2 per cent, consistent with an 
economy that is operating close to capacity.

Output is expected to grow at about 2 per cent over the 
second half of 2018
As expected in the July Report, GDP growth increased to a strong pace of 
2.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2018, mainly due to a surge in exports. 
The economy has solid momentum, so that even with slower export growth, 
real GDP is forecast to expand about 2 per cent on average in the second 
half of 2018 (Table 3 and Chart 5).2

The composition of demand has been shifting toward business investment 
and exports and away from consumption and housing (Chart 6), driven in 
part by households adjusting their spending in response to higher interest 
rates and changes to housing market policies (Box 4). In particular, higher 
mortgage rates, new mortgage finance guidelines, and provincial and muni-
cipal housing market policies are contributing to the softness in housing 
activity this year. After sharp declines earlier in 2018, national resales have 
started recovering. In the Greater Toronto Area, resales have begun to move 
higher, while those in the Greater Vancouver Area have stabilized (Chart 7).3 
The pace of housing starts is expected to pick up in the fourth quarter after 
three quarters of contraction, supported by strengthening demographic 
demand. However, new construction is expected to ease modestly in the 
fourth quarter, reflecting the previous declines in starts and the ongoing shift 
toward lower-value units.

Consumption growth was solid in the second quarter and is expected to 
remain so in the near term, supported by steady income growth and ele-
vated consumer confidence.

2  This forecast does not include the impact of legalization of cannabis on the Canadian System of 

National Accounts (Box 3).

3  Weakness in British Columbia is likely related to the Homes for BC provincial policy. This policy, 

announced in February 2018, includes 30 tax and transparency measures that address speculation and 
affordability in provincial housing markets.

Last observation: 2018Q2

Firms are continuing to expand capacity in response to strong domestic 
and foreign demand, except in the oil and gas sector, where transporta-
tion constraints are an ongoing challenge. Export growth has improved 
since 2017, although volatility in the volume of exports has caused fluctua-
tions in quarterly GDP growth. Exports were soft in the first two months of 
the third quarter, following the surge in the previous quarter. According to 
recent trade data, US tariffs and Canadian countermeasures have reduced 
steel exports and imports, but have not yet visibly affected aluminum ship-
ments. In this context, the trade data provide only a partial view of the much 
broader negative impacts of the tariffs and countermeasures on many firms. 
Negotiations to remove these tariffs are under way.

Box 3

Key inputs to the base-case projection 
The Bank’s projection is always conditional on several key 
assumptions, and changes to them will aﬀ ect the outlook 
for the global and Canadian economies . The Bank regularly 
reviews these assumptions and assesses the sensitivity 
of the economic projection to them . The Bank’s current 
assumptions are as follows:
•  Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent average 

levels . The per-barrel prices in US dollars for Brent, West 
Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western Canada Select 
(WCS) have recently averaged close to $80, $70 and 
$35, respectively . WTI is about the same as assumed 
in the July Report, while Brent is higher by about $5 and 
WCS is lower by about $15 .

•  By convention, the Bank does not attempt to forecast 

the exchange rate in the base-case projection . Over the 
projection horizon, the Canadian dollar is assumed to 
remain close to its recent average of 77 cents, compared 
with 76 cents assumed in July .

•  The Bank estimates that the output gap was in a range 

of -0 .5 to +0 .5 per cent in the third quarter of 2018, 
the same range as the July assumption for the second 
quarter of 2018 . 

•  The annual growth rate of potential output is assumed 

to average 1 .9 per cent over the 2018–20 projection 
horizon, close to the midpoint of the Bank’s estimated 
range (Table 2) . This proﬁ le is slightly stronger than in 
the July scenario, refl ecting a combination of a larger 
population in 2018, due to net international migration, 
and a stronger investment proﬁ le over the projection 
horizon . Details on the Bank’s assessment of potential 
output are provided in the Appendix to the April 2018 
Report .

•  The neutral nominal policy rate is deﬁ ned as the real 
rate consistent with output sustainably at its potential 
level and infl ation equal to target, on an ongoing basis, 
plus 2 per cent for the infl ation target . It is a medium- to

long-term equilibrium concept . For Canada, the neutral 
rate is estimated to be between 2 .5 and 3 .5 per cent . 
The economic projection is based on the midpoint of this 
range, the same rate as in the July Report .

•  Since April 2017, the base-case scenarios have incor-
porated some negative judgment on investment and 
export growth to account for the eﬀ ects of uncertainty 
around trade policy and the expected loss of investment 
competitiveness due to the US tax reform . The new 
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) 
has reduced the uncertainty around US trade policy . For 
this reason, the negative judgment has been reduced 
relative to the July Report . However, it has not been 
entirely removed, given the uncertainty looming from 
other possible trade policy actions and the fact that the 
USMCA has not yet been ratiﬁ ed (Table 3-A) .

•  The ﬁ nal details on how cannabis-related economic 

activity will be incorporated into the Canadian System of 
National Accounts are not yet known . This issue is ﬁ rst 
and foremost about measurement, and the implications 
fo r monetary policy are likely to be small . The eﬀ ects 
of legalization are not incorporated into the Bank’s pro-
jection, but adjustments will be made to projections for 
future Reports once data become available .

New mortgage activity has slowed

Chart 4-A: 
Year-over-year percentage change in the number of new low-ratio 
(loan-to-value ≤ 80 per cent) borrowers, by loan-to-income (LTI) ratio

The impact of policy changes on mortgage lending
Over the past two years, federal authorities have tight-
ened the criteria for mortgage qualiﬁ cation with the aim of 
improving the quality of new mortgage lending . In autumn 
2016, rules for insured mortgages were modiﬁ ed to ensure 
that all borrowers with a high-ratio mortgage qualify using a 
higher interest rate than the posted rate .1 Similarly, in autumn 
2017, the Oﬃ  ce of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions 
revised its mortgage underwriting guidelines (Guideline 
B-20) and introduced a new stress-test requirement for low-
ratio mortgages . These measures, along with higher interest 
rates, have worked together to reduce vulnerabilities associ-
ated with elevated household indebtedness . 
Household credit growth has slowed, and the quality of new 
mortgage lending has improved over the past year . Low-
ratio mortgage originations declined by about 15 per cent 
in the second qua rter of 2018 relative to the same quarter 
in 2017 (Chart 4-A) . While activity fell for all categories of 
borrowers, the drop was more pronounced for those with 
a loan-to-income ratio above 450 per cent, leading to a 
decline in the number of new highly indebted households .2 
A similar eﬀ ect was observed after mortgage insurance 
rules were tightened in October 2016 (Chart 4-B) . Further, 
the largest declines in lending activity over the past year 
have taken place in cities that experienced strong house 
price growth, although provincial and municipal measures 
have also played a signiﬁ cant role over this time period . 
Changes in mortgage ﬁ nance policy have been eﬀ ective in 
mitigating household vulnerabilities and have contributed 
to shifting growth away from housing and consumption . 
They have also generated some volatility in housing market 
activity . The announcement of the revised Guideline B-20 in 
October 2017 and its implementation in January 2018 led to 
a pulling forward of housing resales into the fourth quarter 
of 2017, followed by a sharp drop in the ﬁ rst half of 2018 . 
National resales recovered somewhat in the third quarter, but 
remained at a lower level than at the same time last year .

default insurance . Low-ratio mortgages are typically referred to as uninsured 
mortgages, although lenders will often purchase bulk portfolio insurance for these 
types of mortgages .

The speciﬁ c impacts of the Guideline B-20 revisions are diﬃ  -
cult to quantify since other policy measures, including higher 
interest rates and provincial and municipal housing meas-
ures, have also been implemented over the past two years . 
Recent data are broadly in line with expectations, and the 
Bank will continue to monitor the impact of these measures 
on the economy . Overall, the Bank expects that the revised 

Guideline B-20 should subtract about 0 .2 per cent from the 
level of GDP by the end of 2019 .
While policy measures have been eﬀ ective in reducing 
household vulnerabilities, the sheer size of the outstanding 
stock of debt means that the vulnerability associated with 
elevated household indebtedness will persist for some time .

Last observation: September 2018 

The economy continues to operate close to capacity, and 
core inflation remains near 2 per cent
The economy has been operating near capacity for more than a year. Real 
GDP is estimated to have grown at about potential in the third quarter, leaving 
the output gap the same as was reported for the second quarter in the July 
Report, between -0.5 and +0.5 per cent (Box 3). Firms participating in the 
Bank’s autumn Business Outlook Survey reported that capacity pressures 
continue to be elevated (Chart 8) and labour shortages have intensified.

The demand for labour is strong. Employment grew by 2.0 per cent over 
the 12 months through July,4 and the unemployment rate in September, at 
5.9 per cent, was near its 40-year low. Wage gains have, however, remained 
moderate. Wages, as quantified by the wage-common, were rising at 
2.3 per cent in the second quarter and have been increasing at about that rate 
since the beginning of 2017 (Chart 9).5 Wage gains as reported in Statistics 
Canada’s Labour Force Survey have eased over the past few months from 
elevated rates and are now closer to other measures of wage increases.

4  This measure of employment is industrial aggregate employment, including unclassified businesses, as 

measured by Statistics Canada’s Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours.

5  The wage-common captures underlying wage growth and is constructed by the Bank using the various 

measures of wages published by Statistics Canada. For more details, see D. Brouillette, J. Lachaine 
and B. Vincent, “Wages: Measurement and Key Drivers,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note 
No. 2018-2 (January 2018).

Last observation: 2018Q2

CPI inflation increased from 2.2 per cent in May to 3.0 per cent in July, 
before falling back to 2.2 per cent in September. Readings above 2 per cent 
have been primarily due to temporary factors, including an increase in gas-
oline prices in the first quarter and a surge in airfares in July.6 As a result 
of the unexpected increase in airfares in July and subsequent reversal in 
September, inflation in the third quarter rose by more than anticipated in the 
July Report.

6  A positive surprise to airfare inflation occurred in July, a few months after the introduction of a change 
to the methodology used to measure this component of CPI. A sizable drop in the airfare component 
then occurred in September. It will be difficult to disentangle seasonal factors from underlying price 
movements until at least one year of data based on the new methodology are available. As a result, 
volatility in the airfare component is likely to continue until the second quarter of 2019.

All three core inflation measures have remained close to 2 per cent, reinfor-
cing the Bank’s view that the recent elevated levels of CPI inflation were 
caused by temporary factors (Chart 10). These figures are consistent with 
an economy operating close to full capacity.

The economy is projected to track its potential
The Bank projects that real GDP will continue to grow in line with poten-
tial output over the projection horizon and that the shifting composition of 
growth will stabilize and remain broadly based across goods- and services-
producing industries (Chart 11). Several sectors should contribute notably to 
the further expansion of the economy: non-residential construction outside 
the oil and gas sector, non-durable goods manufacturing, wholesale trade, 
and professional and transportation services.

The projections for investment and exports have been revised up. Some 
of the negative judgment on export and investment projections related to 
trade policy uncertainty has been removed (Box 3). The recently negotiated 
USMCA reduces the uncertainty, although some remains because of the 
escalating trade tensions between China and the United States. The export 
outlook is modestly stronger, as the positive effects of reduced uncertainty 
are partly offset by the impact of lower commodity prices.

The growth profile of government spending in the projection is the same as 
in the July Report. By convention, only announced federal and provincial 
budgets are incorporated into the projection for government spending.

Household spending continues to adjust to policy changes
The outlook for consumption and housing is underpinned by income growth 
as households adjust to revised mortgage guidelines and higher interest 
rates. In line with the expectations of firms participating in the Bank’s 
autumn Business Outlook Survey, wage growth is forecast to rise, driven 
by tightening labour markets and an expected improvement in productivity 
growth. In addition, labour income is being boosted by the larger popula-
tion (Chart 12). Net international migration has surged in recent quarters, 
mainly driven by work permit holders. Compared with expectations in the 
July Report, the larger population than previously assumed has a posi-
tive effect. This is more than offset by the weaker projection for real gross 
domestic income associated with the deterioration in the terms of trade.7

Consumption is projected to grow at a healthy pace, although the pace of 
spending gradually slows in response to rising interest rates. So far, con-
sumption has largely evolved in line with the predictions of the Bank’s 
models since the first increase of the policy rate in mid-2017.

After growing steadily for several years, residential investment is projected 
to be roughly unchanged over the projection horizon. Higher mortgage 
rates and the changes to mortgage guidelines are affecting the dynamics

of housing activity. Housing resales responded quickly to the new mort-
gage guidelines, and the level of resale activity is expected to continue on a 
lower trajectory than before the changes. New home construction is shifting 
toward smaller units, although stronger population growth is estimated to 
raise fundamental demand for housing.

Household credit growth has slowed, and the share of new mortgages with 
high loan-to-income ratios has fallen. The ratio of household debt to income 
has levelled off and is anticipated to edge down (Chart 13). While household 
sector vulnerabilities are expected to ease, they will remain elevated over 
the projection horizon.

Business investment is expected to expand 
Firms outside the oil and gas sector are expected to continue to increase 
capacity in the face of solid domestic and foreign demand (Chart 14). 
Corporate profits are near historical highs, and business sentiment 
remains elevated. Firms participating in the autumn Business Outlook 
Survey reported strong investment intentions, driven by anticipated healthy 
demand, capacity pressures and the need to improve efficiency to keep 
up with competitors. While the overall outlook for investment is favour-
able, competitiveness challenges related to US tax reform and regulatory 
changes, as well as uncertainty around pipeline approval, are still expected 
to lead some exporters to delay their investments or to invest outside 
Canada.

Machinery and equipment manufacturers are making capacity investments 
to meet rising demand. As well, large-scale investment projects, such as 
the LNG Canada project, are currently under way or expected to begin over 
the projection horizon.8 Fast-growing firms in the computer systems design 

8  The confirmed stages of the LNG Canada project include a natural gas pipeline through northern 

British Columbia and an export terminal in Kitimat, British Columbia, where natural gas will be liquefied 
for transport to global markets. This project represents about 3 per cent of business investment in the 
fourth quarter of 2020. The project is considered part of the transportation sector.

sector benefit from broad trends in the adoption of digital technology, both 
domestically and abroad.9 Canada has been successful in attracting foreign 
investment in knowledge-intensive fields, including research and develop-
ment, software design and information technology services, communica-
tions, and professional and business support services.

In the oil and gas sector, investment is expected to be roughly flat over 
2019–20. The outlook is slightly weaker than in the July Report. The revision 
reflects downgraded sentiment in the industry associated with the widening 
of the spread between WTI and WCS and the setback in the Trans Mountain 
Pipeline expansion project.

Exports are projected to grow at a moderate pace
Exports are expected to be underpinned by solid foreign demand and 
increased export capacity, especially as the adverse effects of uncer-
tainty on business sentiment have declined with the recently negotiated 
USMCA. Exports will also benefit from other trade agreements, including 
the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and the 
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership 
(CPTPP), which are reducing barriers to Canadian exports for a wider set of 
countries.10

9  Recent survey work suggests that Canadian firms are adopting digital technologies to varying degrees, 

from high rates for cloud computing and e-commerce to low rates for 3D printing and artificial intelli-
gence. See J. Fudurich, L. Pichette and L. Suchanek, “Adoption of Digital Technologies: Insights from a 
Global Survey Initiative,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note (forthcoming).

10  Tariffs enacted to date by the United States and China on each other’s imports are expected to have 

small net negative effects on Canadian exports over the projection horizon (see Box 1).

Export growth is forecast to continue at a moderate pace, despite several 
limiting factors. Transportation capacity is expected to remain a source of 
restraint on energy exports, while global trade policy uncertainty and ele-
vated competition from other countries—especially in the US market—also 
remain sources of drag. The Bank assesses that loss of investment com-
petitiveness due to US tax reforms and uncertainty associated with global 
trade policies will together lower the level of exports by about 0.6 per cent 
between the third quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2020.

Exports of both commodities and non-commodities are expected to expand 
over the projection horizon (Chart 15). Commodity exports are likely to be 
held back by the effects of the recent US tariffs on steel and aluminum and 
the lower level of non-energy commodity prices. Overall, commodity exports 
should grow at a moderate pace, led by solid energy exports as production 
at oil sands projects continues to expand.

Growth of non-commodity exports is anticipated to be relatively broad-
based. Machinery and equipment manufacturers face strong demand from 
rising US business investment, while aerospace exports are also expected 
to contribute positively to export growth in the short term. Strong growth of 
services-related exports should continue, due to healthy foreign demand for 
professional services and information and support services amid increasing 
US business investment and ongoing digitalization. In contrast, auto sector 
exports are expected to decline somewhat, partly reflecting the production 
mandates of Canadian auto assemblers.

Import growth is expected to slow from 3.4 per cent in 2018 to 1.8 per cent on 
average over 2019 and 2020. This trajectory is in line with the anticipated evo-
lution of import demand from different GDP components, notably investment.

CPI inflation is expected to return to 2 per cent
CPI inflation is projected to decline from 2.7 per cent in the third quarter of 
2018 to close to 2 per cent in early 2019 as the effects of temporary fac-
tors dissipate. The effects of past increases in gasoline prices and min-
imum wages are anticipated to fade in the first quarter of 2019, while those 
of tariff countermeasures are expected to wane by the end of 2019. Inflation 
is subsequently expected to remain close to 2 per cent, consistent with an 
economy operating close to potential output (Chart 16).

The base-case projection provides the Bank’s view of the most likely out-
come for inflation, although any projection is subject to considerable fore-
cast uncertainty. A 90 per cent confidence band around the inflation 
projection widens from ±0.6 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2018 
to ±1.5 percentage points by the end of 2020.

The projection is consistent with medium- and long-term inflation expecta-
tions remaining well anchored. Most respondents to the autumn Business 
Outlook Survey anticipate that average inflation will remain within the 
Bank’s target range of 1 to 3 per cent over the next two years. The majority 
expect inflation to be in the upper half of that range. The September 2018 
Consensus Economics forecast for CPI inflation is 2.4 per cent in 2018 and 
2.1 per cent in 2019, with long-term annual inflation expectations averaging 
2.0 per cent through 2028.

Risks to the inflation outlook

The outlook for inflation is subject to several upside and downside risks. 
Overall, the Bank assesses that the risks to the projected path for inflation 
are roughly balanced. The evolution of the most important risks since July is 
summarized in Table 4.

As in past reports, the focus is on those risks identified as the most 
important to the projected path for inflation, drawing from a larger set of 
risks accounted for in the projection. Since financial vulnerabilities can mag-
nify the impact on the economy and inflation of some adverse events, finan-
cial stability considerations are relevant in a risk-management approach to 
monetary policy. Macroprudential and other financial system policies can 
reduce financial vulnerabilities and the severity of adverse outcomes. For 
this reason, the Bank considers the joint evolution of financial stability risk 
and the macroeconomy when evaluating risks to the inflation outlook, espe-
cially when there are significant changes to this evolution (Box 5).

(i)  Trade conflict between the United States and China

Trade tensions between the United States and China could escalate 
further, and the fallout could be more severe than what is included in 
the projection (Box 1). The largest downside risk would be associated 
with structural changes involving major reallocation of capital and 
labour across sectors and countries. In this context, Canadian exports 
and business investment could suffer from a significant weakening 
of foreign demand, a breakdown of global value chains, plummeting 
business confidence and lower commodity prices. At the same time, 
there could be inflationary supply effects stemming from the increase 
in global input costs and lower productivity, combined with the impact 
of exchange rate pass-through. On balance, there is a significant risk 
that the result would be lower real activity and higher inflation as this 
adjustment proceeds. 

In contrast, if the United States and China were to negotiate an end to 
the tariffs imposed this year, global and Canadian economic activity 
would be stronger than in the base-case projection. As well, the near-
term positive impacts of tariffs on prices would be removed.

(ii)  Positive confidence effects of the USMCA 

Some of the negative judgment associated with trade policy uncer-
tainty in North America has been removed in the base-case projec-
tion. However, assuming that the agreement is ratified, the USMCA 
could also catalyze a larger improvement in business sentiment, 
leading to stronger investment and exports than in the base-case 
projection.

banK oF CanaDa  •  MonEtaRy PoliCy REPoRt  •  oCtobER 2018

 

(iii)  Stronger real GDP growth in the United States

US GDP growth could be higher over the projection horizon if tax 
reform, deregulation or fiscal stimulus had larger positive impacts 
than currently embedded in the base-case projection. The resulting 
boost to investment, as well as stronger household spending, would 
have positive implications for Canadian investment and exports. 

(iv)  Sharp tightening of global financial conditions

Global financial conditions remain broadly accommodative but 
could tighten suddenly. Several triggers could lead to higher term 
premiums and risk premiums. These include an escalation of trade 
tensions, faster-than-anticipated pickups in wage and price inflation in 
advanced economies, or significant increases in expectations of the 
future path of monetary policy. If premiums were to rise, the higher 
bond yields in advanced economies could increase capital outflows 
from EMEs, exacerbating country-specific vulnerabilities in some 
cases. These developments could translate into a decline in activity 
in sectors sensitive to interest rates, a rise in debt-service burdens, 
lower commodity prices, and weaker global and Canadian growth.

(v)  Stronger consumption and rising household debt in Canada

Elevated consumer confidence could lead to stronger consumer 
spending and higher inflationary pressures than in the base-case 
projection. In addition, a shift in housing demand to less-expensive 
units could free up income for consumption. If additional spending 
were financed by more borrowing, then vulnerabilities associated with 
household indebtedness could be exacerbated.

(vi)  A pronounced decline in house prices in certain regions

There has been some progress in mitigating household imbalances 
in certain regions. Partly reflecting the impact of various policy 
measures, house price growth has moderated in recent quarters and 
there is less evidence of speculation in some markets. Nevertheless, 
price levels remain high in the greater Vancouver and Toronto areas, 
and the economy is in a rising interest rate environment. Thus, there 
remains a risk of a sharp decline in house prices in these markets, 
which could dampen consumption, housing demand and construction 
activity.

Box 5

 

Financial stability risk and monetary policy
The Bank of Canada considers interactions between the 
macroeconomy and the ﬁ nancial system when setting 
monetary policy . The two are connected because mon-
etary policy infl uences the evolution of ﬁ nancial vulner-
abilities, including through its impact on risk taking, asset 
prices and leverage . Financial vulnerabilities in turn aﬀ ect 
the economy and the transmission of monetary policy . 
For example, elevated levels of household indebtedness 
and housing imbalances increase ﬁ nancial stability risk by 
making the impact of adverse events—such as a downturn 
in economic activity—even more severe . This box illus-
trates one approach to thinking about these issues in an 
integrated manner .1
One way to measure ﬁ nancial stability risk is to look at how 
much worse growth could be than forecast . Growth at risk 
is the GDP growth rate we expect to exceed with 95 per 
cent conﬁ dence, given current conditions and past rela-
tionships .2 It is infl uenced by macroeconomic performance, 
ﬁ nancial market developments and ﬁ nancial vulnerabilities . 
Since 2014, the growth in household indebtedness and 
housing market imbalances has moved growth at risk 
further away from the forecast, even as macroeconomic 
performance has improved . The extent to which these vul-
nerabilities have added to ﬁ nancial stability risk is shown in 
Chart 5-A .3 
Macroeconomic performance can be measured using 
macroeconomic deviations . One measure is the average 
of the absolute values of the output gap and the diﬀ erence 
between the infl ation forecast and 2 per cent . The smaller 
the deviations, the better the macroeconomic perform-
ance . Macroeconomic performance deteriorated following 
the sharp decline in oil prices in the second half of 2014 .

Disinfl ationary pressures led the Bank to cut interest rates 
and, as the economy recovered, macroeconomic perform-
ance improved and macroeconomic deviations waned .  
Using this framework, the Bank can track the evolution of 
household and housing market vulnerabilities and macro-
economic performance over the projection horizon . The 
current direction of monetary policy has favourable impli-
cations for household indebtedness and housing market 
imbalances and for achievement of the Bank’s infl ation 
objective . The Bank expects that ﬁ nancial stability risk will 
decline as households adjust their borrowing and spending 
in response to tighter mortgage underwriting guidelines and 
higher interest rates . Higher interest rates also contribute to 
macroeconomic stability by keeping output close to poten-
tial and infl ation close to the target . While the contribution 
of these vulnerabilities to ﬁ nancial stability risk is projected 
to ease, its level is expected to remain elevated for some 
time, given the existing stock of highly indebted households .

Canada’s infl ation-control strategy
Canada’s infl ation-control strategy
Infl ation targeting and the economy
  The objective of Canada’s monetary policy is to promote the 

economic and fi nancial well‑being of Canadians. Canada’s 
experience with infl ation targeting since 1991 has shown that the 
best way that monetary policy can achieve this goal is by maintaining 
a low and stable infl ation environment. Doing so fosters confi dence 
in the value of money and contributes to sustained economic growth, 
a strong and inclusive labour market and improved living standards.
In 2021, the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada 
renewed the fl exible infl ation‑targeting strategy of the monetary policy 
framework for a further fi ve‑year period, ending December 31, 2026.1 
  The infl ation target was renewed at the 2% midpoint of the 1%–3% 

 

control range, with infl ation measured as the 12‑month rate of 
change in the consumer price index (CPI). 

  The Government and the Bank agreed that the best contribution 

monetary policy can make to the economic and fi nancial 
well‑being of Canadians is to continue to focus on price stability. 
The Government and the Bank also agreed that monetary policy 
should continue to support maximum sustainable employment, 
recognizing that maximum sustainable employment is not directly 
measurable and is determined largely by non‑monetary factors 
that can change through time. 

  Further, the Government and the Bank agreed that because well‑
anchored infl ation expectations are critical to achieving both price 
stability and maximum sustainable employment, the primary objective 
of monetary policy is to maintain low, stable infl ation over time. 

Infl ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible
  Canada’s infl ation‑targeting approach is symmetric, which means 

the Bank is equally concerned about infl ation rising above or falling 
below the 2% target. 

  Canada’s infl ation‑targeting approach is also ﬂ exible. Typically, 

the Bank seeks to return infl ation to target over a horizon of six to 
eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning 
infl ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence 
of the shocks buffeting the economy.

  The 2021 agreement with the Government specifi es that the 2% 

infl ation target remains the cornerstone of the framework. 

  The agreement further notes that the Bank will continue to use the 

fl exibility of the 1%–3% control range to actively seek the maximum 
sustainable level of employment, when conditions warrant. The Bank 
will also continue to leverage the fl exibility inherent in the framework 
to help address the challenges of structurally low interest rates by 
using a broad set of policy tools. The Bank will use this fl exibility only 
to an extent that is consistent with keeping medium‑term infl ation 
expectations well anchored at 2%.

Monetary policy tools
  Because monetary policy actions take time to work their way through 

the economy and have their full effect on infl ation, monetary policy 
must be forward‑looking.

  The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes 
in the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate). The 
Bank also has a range of monetary policy tools it can use when the 
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on 
the future evolution of the policy rate, large‑scale asset purchases 
(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures, 
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these 
tools would depend on the economic and fi nancial market context.

  All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for 

Canadian goods and services through their infl uence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The 
balance between this demand and the economy’s production 
capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl ation 
pressures in the economy.

Communications
  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent communications, 

the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the economy and 
infl ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight pre‑set 
days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s outlook are 
published four times each year in the Monetary Policy Report.

  The Bank is committed to explaining when it is using the fl exibility of 

the infl ation‑targeting strategy.

  Given the uncertainty about the maximum sustainable level of 

employment, the Bank will consider a broad range of labour market 
indicators.2 The Bank will also systematically report to Canadians on 
how labour market outcomes have factored into its policy decisions.

Monitoring infl ation
 

 

In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile and can cause sizable fl uctuations in CPI infl ation.
In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such 
transitory movements in CPI infl ation and focuses on a set of “core” 
infl ation measures that better refl ect the underlying trend of infl ation. 
In this sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the 
Bank achieve the CPI infl ation target. They are not a replacement for 
CPI infl ation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl ation are CPI‑trim, 
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given 
month are the most extreme; CPI‑median, which corresponds to 
the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket 
weight) of the distribution of price changes; and CPI‑common, which 
uses a statistical procedure to track common price changes across 
categories in the CPI basket.

Overview 
Overview 

The Canadian economy has strong momentum, and employment is robust. 
While COVID‑19 continues to affect people’s health and the economy, high 
vaccination rates are lessening severe impacts. Household consumption 
spending is strengthening as most public health containment measures are 
being lifted, and exports are expected to benefit from solid foreign demand.

The unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine is causing enormous human 
suffering and has introduced significant uncertainty to the outlook for the 
global economy. The effects of the war are weighing on global activity and 
have resulted in greater volatility in financial markets. The war has also 
pushed commodity prices higher and further disrupted supply chains.

As a result, inflation has increased in most economies, including Canada’s. 
Energy and food prices continue to rise, and ongoing supply constraints 
are interacting with robust demand to put upward pressure on a broadening 
range of prices. 

Key messages
  The outlook for CPI inflation in Canada is higher than previously projected. 
Inflation is expected to average just below 6% through the first half of 2022 
and remain well above the control range through the rest of the year. It should 
then steadily decline to about 2½% in the second half of 2023 and to the 2% 
target in 2024. This decline reflects decreases in energy prices, a dissipation 
of global supply chain constraints and a rebalancing of supply and demand in 
the Canadian economy.

  Labour market conditions in Canada are tight. Employment and 

participation rates are near or above their pre‑pandemic levels, and the 
unemployment rate is at a record low. Overall, the Canadian economy is 
moving into excess demand.

  Canadian economic activity is expected to remain strong. Consumer 

spending, exports and business investment are projected to grow solidly. 
This is supported by healthy foreign demand, high commodity prices and 
the easing of supply disruptions. 

  Higher interest rates should moderate spending and gradually reduce 

excess demand in the Canadian economy.

  Alongside an easing of supply challenges, high immigration levels and 
a solid recovery in business investment are expected to support strong 
potential output growth.

  The Bank is paying particular attention to how inflation expectations are 
evolving. While long‑term expectations remain anchored on the target, 
near‑term expectations have risen along with inflation.

Global economy
Global economy

Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is taking a tragic human toll. It is 
also disrupting the global economic recovery just as most economies are 
emerging from the impact of the Omicron variant of COVID‑19. The war has 
exacerbated global supply shortages by restricting global transportation and 
imports of products from both Ukraine and Russia. Consequently, the prices 
of oil, grains and other commodities have risen sharply, and financial volatility 
has increased.

The global outlook has been downgraded from the January Report (Box 1). 
Revisions are pronounced for oil‑importing economies and regions with 
closer trade ties to Russia and Ukraine, particularly Eastern Europe and, to a 
lesser extent, the euro area. The US outlook has also been revised down due 
largely to the anticipated tightening of monetary policy in response to higher‑
than‑expected inflation.

Box 1

Higher energy prices have led to positive revisions to 
exports and investment in the oil and gas sector. These 
revisions are roughly offset by the effect of lower foreign 
demand on non‑commodity exports and the impact from 
higher interest rates on household spending.

Changes to the economic projection since the January Report 
Global GDP outlook
Projected growth in global gross domestic product 
(GDP) in 2022 remains roughly unchanged relative to 
the January Report. The negative effects of the war 
in Ukraine are roughly offset by a smaller drag from 
COVID‑19 containment measures in emerging‑market 
economies. Global growth for 2023 has been revised 
down signifi cantly because the negative consequences 
of the war are expected to persist through higher 
commodity prices as well as trade and fi nancial 
channels. The downward revision to the US outlook 
also refl ects a faster and more pronounced tightening 
of monetary policy in response to higher‑than‑expected 
infl ation. Overall, the level of global GDP at the end of 
2023 has been revised down by about 1%.

Canadian CPI infl ation outlook
Consumer price index (CPI) infl ation is anticipated to 
be substantially higher than projected in January. The 
outlook for CPI infl ation is revised up by 1.1 percentage 
points to 5.3% in 2022 and by 0.5 percentage points to 
2.8% in 2023. These revisions are primarily related to 
the consequences of the invasion of Ukraine, which has 
driven up commodity prices and exacerbated supply 
disruptions. 

Canadian GDP outlook
GDP growth is revised up by about ¼ percentage 
point to 4¼% in 2022 and revised down by about 
¼ percentage point to 3¼% in 2023. Overall, these 
revisions leave the level of real GDP roughly unchanged 
by the end of 2023.

Global growth is projected to moderate from about 7% in 2021 to 3½% in 
2022 and 2½% in 2023 (Table 1). This should occur as the bounce back in 
activity from the acute phase of the pandemic wanes and the Russia–Ukraine 
conflict weighs on the outlook. The Bank expects global growth to strengthen 
to 3¼% in 2024 once the war’s initial impact on growth subsides.

Inflation continued to rise in the first quarter and remains high in most 
regions, with strong positive contributions from energy and food prices 
(Chart 1). Robust demand for goods and widespread supply shortages also 
remain important sources of inflationary pressure globally.

GlOBAl ECONOMy  4 

Sharp increase in commodity prices
Russia and Ukraine are significant exporters of commodities. Market 
concerns about supply disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine have led to a 
sharp rise in most commodity prices (Chart 2).
Oil prices have been volatile since the January Report. Before Russia’s 
invasion, oil prices were already rising because oil demand was outpacing 
the growth in supply. The Russian invasion led to sharply higher prices, with 
the daily price of Brent crude oil peaking at nearly US$130 a barrel in early 
March. The Brent oil price has since fallen to around US$105 as the scope of 
sanctions on Russian oil has become clearer and the United States and other 
countries announced large releases of their strategic petroleum reserves. 
The recent COVID‑19 outbreak in China has also raised concerns about the 
strength of oil demand.

The Bank assumes that the price of Brent crude oil will fall from US$105 
per barrel in the second quarter of 2022 to about US$90 at the end of 2024 
(Box 2). West Texas Intermediate and Western Canadian Select crude oil 
prices are assumed to follow similar patterns, remaining US$5 and US$15, 
respectively, below Brent prices. This profile assumes that the war’s impact 
on oil prices diminishes over time and is broadly consistent with market 
expectations. 

Uncertainty around the assumed outlook for oil prices is particularly high. 
Prices could rise further if Russian oil exports are weaker than expected or if 
global oil production does not increase enough to meet demand. A resolution 
of the conflict in Ukraine, a rapid increase in global production or a drop in oil 
consumption could lead to a faster decline in prices.

Key inputs to the projection
The Bank of Canada’s projection is always conditional 
on several key assumptions, and changes to these will 
affect the outlook for the Canadian economy. The Bank 
regularly reviews these assumptions and how they may 
impact the economic projection. The key inputs into the 
Bank’s projection are as follows:

  Public health restrictions have been largely removed 

in many countries. It is assumed that remaining 
measures will be lifted over the course of 2022 for 
most of the world. Containment measures in China 
are expected to loosen more gradually—and even 
periodically tighten—over 2022.

  In Canada, most public health restrictions have been 
lifted. Pandemic‑related effects on demand—notably 
consumer caution and reluctance to travel—are 
assumed to fade over 2022 and 2023.

  As in the January projection, spending on household 

consumption is assumed to be boosted by an additional 
$40 billion as individuals draw down a portion of the 
extra savings accumulated during the pandemic.

  The projection does not incorporate the measures 

announced in the April 2022 federal budget. 
Preliminary analysis suggests the budget’s impact will 
be positive but modest relative to the Bank’s projection. 

  Oil prices are assumed to decrease over the 

projection horizon from their current elevated levels. 
The price of Brent stays near its recent average 
of US$105 per barrel in the second quarter of 
2022 before declining to about US$90 by the end 
of 2024. The prices for West Texas Intermediate 
(WTI) and Western Canadian Select (WCS) follow 
similar dynamics, with a constant spread below the 
price for Brent of US$5 and US$15, respectively. 
In the January Report, the prices were assumed to 
be US$80 for Brent, US$75 for WTI and US$65 for 
WCS.

  By convention, the Bank does not forecast the 

exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. As in 
the January Report, the Canadian dollar is assumed 
to remain at 79 cents US over the projection horizon, 
close to its recent average.

  The pandemic is having both temporary and lasting 
effects on the supply side of the Canadian economy. 
As in recent reports, the Bank distinguishes between 
supply and potential output to account for the 
relatively short‑lived nature of some of the decrease 
in supply caused by pandemic‑related factors, such 
as public health measures and supply disruptions.

  The Bank’s assessment of potential output 

growth, a longer‑term concept, looks through the 
short‑lived effects of pandemic‑related factors. 
Potential output growth (excluding temporary 
factors) is assumed to average about 2% per 
year over 2022–24. Details on the Bank’s 
assessment of potential output growth are 
provided in the Appendix on page 28.

  The projection assumes that short‑term factors 
are reducing the supply of goods and services. 
For instance, supply disruptions are assumed to 
reduce supply, with a peak impact of about 2% 
in both the fourth quarter of 2021 and the fi rst 
quarter of 2022 and a still‑elevated impact of 1¾% 
in the second quarter. This effect is anticipated 
to dissipate by mid‑2023, two quarters later than 
assumed in January. Moreover, measures taken 
to contain the Omicron variant of COVID‑19 
coupled with elevated worker absences due to 
the rise in cases are estimated to have decreased 
supply temporarily in the fi rst quarter of 2022 (see 
Chart 13 on page 19).

  Estimates of overall growth in supply can be 
obtained by combining the estimates of the 
temporary effects of these short‑term factors with 
the assessment of potential output. Supply growth 
is projected to average about 2½% over 2022–24.

  Gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have 

grown at a stronger‑than‑potential pace in the fi rst 
quarter of 2022 amid elevated supply disruptions. 
As a result, the Bank estimates that the output 
gap—the difference between GDP and supply—
was between ‑0.25% and 0.75% in the fi rst quarter, 
higher than the estimate of ‑0.75% to 0.25% for the 
fourth quarter of 2021. 

  The nominal neutral policy interest rate is defi ned as 

the real neutral rate plus 2% for infl ation. The real 
neutral rate is defi ned as the rate consistent with 
both output remaining sustainably at its potential 
and infl ation remaining at target, on an ongoing 
basis. It is a medium‑ to long‑term equilibrium 
concept. In this Report, the Bank has updated its 
estimated range of the nominal neutral interest 
rate in conjunction with the annual reassessment 
of potential output. This range is judged to be 
0.25 percentage points higher than assessed 
in April 2021 (see Appendix). For Canada, the 
projection is based on the assumption that the 
nominal neutral rate is at the midpoint of the revised 
range of 2% to 3%.

The Bank’s non‑energy commodity price index has increased by about 
10% since the January Report. The increase in prices of base metals and 
agricultural commodities mainly reflects the supply disruptions caused 
by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While unchanged relative to the January 
Report, lumber prices remain high because of strong housing demand in 
North America and continued transportation bottlenecks. Markets expect 
non‑energy commodity prices to remain elevated over the projection horizon 
because of uncertain supply from Russia and Ukraine as well as strong 
global demand.

More volatile financial markets
Financial conditions have tightened since the January Report, mainly as a 
result of higher current and expected interest rates in many regions. Increased 
uncertainty about the impact of the war in Ukraine has also led to more 
volatility in the prices of many financial assets. In early March, in response 
to the invasion of Ukraine, corporate credit spreads widened and most 
equity price indexes dropped sharply. Credit spreads and equity prices have 
returned to near pre‑war levels in most regions. Canadian equity indexes have 
outperformed those of other countries due to their high exposure to energy and 
other commodities. The Canadian dollar has been relatively stable against the 
US dollar despite rising commodity prices (Box 2).
Expectations of higher inflation and tighter monetary policy have pushed up 
yields of government bonds globally, in particular for short‑term bonds. This 
has narrowed the spread between long‑ and short‑term government bond 
yields in North America.

Broad inflationary pressure in the United States
US domestic demand has been growing at a robust pace. Job gains remain 
strong amid a tight labour market. Nominal wage growth continues to be 
vigorous, but high inflation is eliminating gains in real compensation.

US gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to expand by 2¾% in 2022, well 
above the estimated rate of potential output growth (see the Appendix on 
page 28). Because the United States is a net exporter of petroleum products 
and has limited trade exposure to Russia and Ukraine, the war should have 
only a modest negative impact on growth. Consumption is anticipated to rise 
at a healthy pace, supported by employment growth and some household 
spending of the savings accumulated during the pandemic. Solid private 
domestic demand should also drive robust business investment growth. 
Recent increases in mortgage rates are, however, expected to dampen 
growth in residential investment. GDP growth is projected to moderate to 
about 2% in 2023 and 1½% in 2024 as US authorities withdraw fiscal and 
monetary policy stimulus.

Total and core measures of US personal consumption expenditures (PCE) 
inflation have continued to increase and are at their highest levels in nearly 
40 years. Large increases in energy prices as well as supply constraints amid 
high demand for goods continue to be important contributors to inflationary 
pressures. Relative to the January Report, delivery times have shortened 
modestly, and order backlogs are slowly being cleared (Chart 3). However, 
shipping and input costs remain high. The war is expected to exacerbate 
pressures on supply chains and put additional upward pressure on inflation 
in the near term. In the projection, the Bank assumes that supply challenges 
continue to ease but persist until mid‑2023. Inflation is projected to start 
decreasing in the third quarter but is expected to stay above 2% over the 
projection horizon as the economy remains in excess demand.

In response to strong inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve raised 
the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in March. It also announced that 
additional increases will be needed and that it will begin reducing its holdings 
of Treasury and other securities in the near future.

Growing headwinds in the euro area
Household and business confidence in the euro area are being hit hard by 
the increased uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine, higher energy prices 
and continuing supply challenges. GDP is nevertheless expected to grow at a 
faster pace than potential output over the projection horizon as the economy 
continues to recover from the pandemic. 

Both core and total inflation have risen more quickly than anticipated in recent 
months and are now well above target. Higher energy and food prices explain 
a significant portion of the recent increase, although inflationary pressure has 
become more broad‑based across goods and services. The recent increase 
in energy prices and additional supply constraints related to the invasion of 
Ukraine are expected to push inflation higher in the near term.

Modest growth in China
China’s GDP is expected to grow at a modest pace of 4¼% in 2022. Growth 
is held back in large part by the ongoing correction of its property market 
and stringent measures to contain a resurgence of COVID‑19. Housing 
markets remain weak, reflecting soft demand and uncertainty about the 
financial viability of major property developers. High energy prices should 
also weigh on household and business spending. Chinese stock markets 
recently reacted sharply to concerns about regulatory changes, financial 
vulnerabilities and the geopolitical implications of the war in Ukraine. Policy‑
makers have announced steps to improve confidence and shore up markets.

Growth is projected to recover to about 5% in 2023 and 2024 as the drag 
on growth from the property sector diminishes. Uncertainty remains high 
about both the impact of China’s “zero‑COVID” policy and the fragility of the 
property sector. Either of these factors could dampen growth by more than 
expected over the projection horizon.

Weaker growth in emerging-market economies and 
the rest of the world
Oil‑importing emerging‑market economies (EMEs) are recovering from the 
impact of the Omicron variant more quickly than expected. However, the 
war in Ukraine and high energy prices are expected to severely hamper 
growth in 2022 and 2023. Within the group, emerging Europe will be most 
affected because of its proximity to the conflict, its closer trade ties with both 
Ukraine and Russia and the war’s direct impact on Ukraine’s economy. In 
some EMEs, the drag from rising energy prices should be partially offset by 
increased revenues from exports of non‑energy commodities. Higher interest 
rates in many EMEs in response to increasing inflationary pressures are also 
weighing on growth prospects.

Growth in the rest of the world group will be held back by the sharp 
contraction of the Russian economy due to economic sanctions. However, 
other oil‑exporting countries are expected to benefit from increased oil 
revenues.

Canadian economy
Canadian economy

The Canadian economy continues to grow strongly. Growth in the second 
quarter is being boosted by the removal of public health restrictions, solid 
foreign demand and higher commodity prices.

Labour markets are tight. Employment growth has been strong, with jobs more 
than recovering from the effects of the Omicron variant of COVID‑19. Labour 
shortages are widespread across firms, leading to rising wage growth.

A broad set of indicators suggests that slack has been absorbed and the 
economy is moving into excess demand. Faced with robust demand and supply 
constraints, firms are raising prices in response to higher input costs. This 
increases the risk that expectations of elevated inflation could become entrenched.

Overall, economic growth is robust and moderates through the projection 
horizon. Growth is expected to be 4¼% this year before slowing to a solid 
pace of 3¼% in 2023. A recovery in services consumption, exports and 
investment supports growth (Table 2). At the same time, alongside the 
easing of supply constraints, strong investment and population growth are 
projected to strengthen potential output growth. In response to ongoing 
inflationary pressures, higher interest rates are expected to moderate growth 
in domestic demand to better align it with the growth of supply. GDP growth 
is projected to ease to about 2¼% in 2024.

The war in Ukraine is affecting the Canadian economy predominantly through 
higher commodity prices (Box 3). Households are feeling this impact through 
increased prices for gasoline, fuel oil and food.

Consumer price index (CPI) inflation is forecast to average just under 6% 
in the first half of 2022. Factors driving inflation include sharp increases in 
energy and food prices as well as supply disruptions and strong demand for 
goods. As these pressures dissipate and monetary policy accommodation is 
removed, CPI inflation is anticipated to ease to about 2½% in the second half 
of 2023 before declining to the 2% target in 2024. In this projection, inflation 
is both higher and more persistent than in the January Report (Box 1).

Box 3

Th  e impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the Canadian economy 
In addition to its tragic human toll, the war in Ukraine 
is negatively affecting economies around the world. 
However, for commodity exporters, the negative impacts 
on global growth are offset by the effects of higher 
commodity prices.

components of the CPI, such as gasoline, natural 
gas, food and transportation, will face a direct 
impact.

Impacts from higher commodity prices
For a net commodity exporter such as Canada, rising 
commodity prices are typically associated with a 
boost to economic activity and increased infl ationary 
pressures. Higher commodity prices affect the following 
channels:

  Terms of trade: The prices of Canada’s exports 

should increase. This improvement in the terms of 
trade means more income fl owing into Canada—
which can be spent on domestic and imported 
goods and services.

  Commodity production: Production, exports and 
investment in commodity‑related sectors will rise, 
supporting Canadian employment and incomes.

commodities are used as inputs. This is expected to 
dampen economic activity and contribute to further 
infl ationary pressures.

In the current context, the boost to Canadian economic 
growth from higher energy prices may be more 
subdued. The pickup in production and investment in 
the oil and gas sector is expected to be muted given 
uncertainty about long‑term demand. Moreover, while 
commodity exporters will benefi t from higher prices, 
the overall impact on global growth is anticipated to be 
negative. As a result, softer demand for Canada’s non‑
commodity exports is expected to offset some of the 
anticipated lift from higher commodity prices.

While economic activity will increase less than usual, 
the impacts on infl ation may be larger. The Canadian 
dollar typically strengthens with rising commodity prices. 
A stronger dollar would usually dampen infl ationary 
pressures by lowering the domestic price of imported 
products relative to domestically produced goods and 
services. Currently, however, the Can$/US$ exchange 
rate has remained relatively unchanged since the start 
of the war.

Further stress on global supply chains 
The war and the resulting trade restrictions are expected 
to worsen and prolong some global supply chain 
disruptions, especially for commodities. While the 
magnitude of this effect is uncertain, it will weigh on the 
recovery in global growth, and prices will face additional 
upward pressure.

Box 3 (continued)

The course of the war and its implications for economic 
activity are highly uncertain. As long as commodity 
prices remain elevated, they will support some 
increased investment and activity in the resource sector. 
They will also boost domestic income and aggregate 
demand. However, these effects are likely to be 
dampened by softer global growth and more persistent 
supply chain disruptions.

In addition, other factors could become important 
depending on how the situation evolves. For example, 
immigration levels could rise with the movement of 
refugees from the confl ict. Supply reductions and price 

increases in global energy and commodity markets 
could also have long‑term implications for investment in, 
and the development of, alternative sources.

Implications for infl ation
The implications of the war in Ukraine for infl ation in 
Canada are clear and large. These include the impacts 
of commodity‑linked prices, increased production costs 
and more pervasive supply chain disruptions. Together 
these add 0.7 percentage points to CPI infl ation in 2022.

Stronger second-quarter growth 
Economic growth is expected to pick up to about 6% in the second quarter of 
2022 from a solid pace of 3% in the first quarter (Table 3 and Chart 4). The 
effects of the Omicron variant weighed on economic activity in the first weeks 
of the year, but these effects were short‑lived, and household consumption 
was resilient. Growth is on track for a strong consumption‑led pickup in the 
second quarter as pandemic restrictions are removed. This is despite supply 
disruptions and labour shortages continuing to hold back the production and 
availability of a wide range of goods (Chart 5).
Housing market activity remained strong in the first quarter. The pandemic‑
induced increase in demand for more housing space, along with still‑low 
borrowing rates and high disposable income, has boosted activity. Resales 
are expected to soften somewhat in the second quarter as borrowing rates 
rise. Low levels of both builders’ inventories and existing homes for sale 
should support new construction and renovations in the near term.

Exports and business investment are expected to grow strongly in the 
second quarter as they continue to recover toward pre‑pandemic levels. 
Higher energy prices are boosting growth in energy exports and investment 
(Chart 6). Outside the energy sector, solid foreign demand and a rebound in 
exports of motor vehicles are supporting exports.

Tight labour markets
Employment bounced back sharply in recent months. Overall measures 
of labour market health are strong when compared with a wide range of 
benchmarks.1 For instance, employment and total hours worked have 
surpassed pre‑pandemic levels (Chart 7). Moreover, many of the groups hit 
hardest by the pandemic have seen robust recoveries, notably young women.

In the Bank of Canada’s Business Outlook Survey (BOS) for the first 
quarter of 2022, indicators of labour shortages remain elevated. Most firms 
experiencing labour shortages expect them to persist until at least 2023. 
While roughly two‑thirds of respondents plan to increase the size of their 
workforce to meet strong demand, many cited difficulty finding workers.

Wage growth has risen to near pre‑pandemic levels (Chart 8). Wage growth 
is expected to increase further alongside elevated job vacancies, workers’ 
increased willingness to switch jobs and a record‑low unemployment rate. 
The strengthening in wages is consistent with the latest BOS, where firms 
report having difficulty attracting and retaining staff.

Canadian economy moving into excess demand
A broad set of measures suggests that economic slack has been absorbed 
and that the economy is starting to operate beyond its productive capacity.

Canadian firms are increasingly facing capacity pressures amid a tight 
labour market and pervasive supply chain challenges. Roughly 8 out of 
10 respondents to the BOS said they would have difficulty meeting an 
unexpected increase in demand—a new survey high (Chart 9). More firms 
intend to pass cost increases related to supply chain disruptions and rising 
wages into their output prices. Core measures of inflation have all risen 
materially above 2%.

Taking these respective demand and supply pressures into account, the 
Bank estimates that the output gap has risen to between ‑0.25% and 0.75% 
for the first quarter of 2022, up from the estimate of ‑0.75% to 0.25% for the 
last quarter of 2021 (Box 2). With robust growth expected in the second 
quarter, the economy is moving into excess demand.

CPI inflation at multi-decade high
Elevated energy and food prices are expected to push CPI inflation to just 
under 6% in the first half of 2022 (Chart 10). Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has 
driven up commodity prices. In Canada, households are feeling this through 
higher prices for gasoline and fuel oil. The impacts on the cost of wheat, corn 
and soybeans will also boost food prices in coming quarters, compounding 
the effects of last year’s drought and supply bottlenecks.

Pervasive supply constraints, together with strong global and domestic 
demand, are also contributing to the rise in prices of a wide range of goods 
and services (Box 4). As a result, price pressures are broadening, with about 
two‑thirds of CPI components growing above 3% (Chart 11).

Domestic and global determinants of infl ation in Canada
Consumer price index (CPI) infl ation hit a three‑decade 
high in February 2022, reaching 5.7% on a year‑over‑
year basis. The run‑up in infl ation refl ects global factors, 
such as strong demand and supply chain disruptions, 
as well as domestic factors. Understanding the impacts 
of these factors can help better assess how long 
infl ationary pressures will remain elevated and how to 
adjust the response in Canadian monetary policy.

Goods infl ation hit 7.6% in February, twice as high as 
services infl ation. Oil prices are set in global markets, 
and the pass‑through to the price of gasoline in Canada 
is typically rapid and high. Domestic food prices are also 
affected because they are linked to global agricultural 
prices as well as domestic crop conditions and local 
supply constraints. Energy and food price infl ation 
are at 24% and 7.4%, respectively; together, they are 
contributing roughly 2.5 percentage points to CPI 
infl ation.

Durable goods prices have also been rising quickly 
(Chart 4‑A). Shortages of semiconductor chips are

durable goods markets, strong global demand is playing 
an important role, compounded by supply challenges. 
Two examples are furniture and household appliances, 
which together make up nearly 3% of the CPI. Prices for 
these goods have been rising quickly alongside sales.

In contrast, domestic factors are the key driver for 
services prices. Although infl ation of these prices is 
running well below that of goods prices, it has also 
picked up. The strongest gains have been seen in 
homeowners’ replacement costs, which are rising at 
a pace close to 13% (Chart 4‑B). While the inputs for 
construction, such as lumber and copper, refl ect global 
factors, housing is also infl uenced by domestic demand 
and supply conditions. These include demand factors, 
such as population growth, historically low borrowing 
rates and an increased preference for more housing 
space. They also include supply constraints, such as 
labour shortages and, in some cases, limited availability 
of land for development. The strength in housing price 
infl ation is also fi nding its way into rent infl ation, which 
has risen to over 4%.

CPI infl ation: year‑over‑year percentage change, monthly data

Other services prices, however, are rising at a 
slower pace. For example, child care and personal 
care services are growing at less than 2% and 3%, 
respectively, because price developments in these 
categories primarily refl ect pressures on domestic 
wages. Moreover, some categories, such as 
communications, have seen prices fall despite higher 
real spending because of ongoing digitalization.

Overall, the pickup in infl ation has been concentrated 
in traded goods prices. This refl ects both global 
and domestic conditions. Domestically driven price 
pressures have emerged in services prices. We see 
this in homeowners’ replacement costs, rents and other 
services as the economy is moving into excess demand.

Measures of core inflation continue to rise alongside widening inflationary 
pressures, with CPI‑trim, CPI‑median and CPI‑common at 4.3%, 3.5% and 
2.6%, respectively (Chart 12). The increases reflect more widespread price 
pressures and are consistent with an economy that is moving into excess

Strong economic growth and easing inflation
Growth is projected to be 4¼% in 2022, easing to a still‑solid pace of 3¼% in 
2023, supported by robust domestic demand and exports. The tight labour 
market and improved terms of trade are expected to boost aggregate income 
and wealth. In turn, high income and a drawdown of some pandemic‑related 
savings will drive domestic spending. In addition, an increase in potential 
output will further support growth in domestic income and demand.

Pandemic‑related restrictions and supply disruptions have weighed on 
output. With employment growing faster than output, productivity growth 
has been weak. However, public health restrictions have now been largely 
removed, and supply disruptions are expected to dissipate gradually by 
mid‑2023 (Chart 13). As caution around the pandemic fades and supply 
shortages ease, GDP is expected to grow faster than employment, and 
output per worker to rise.

Together with robust business investment and higher immigration, this rise 
in labour productivity growth is projected to boost supply growth from about 
1¾% this year to roughly 3¼% in 2023 (see Appendix on page 28). This will 
provide room for solid economic growth with declining inflation.

Higher interest rates in Canada and the normalization of monetary policy 
globally are expected to moderate domestic demand growth. GDP and 
supply growth will both ease to about 2¼% and 2½%, respectively, in 2024.

Expansion led by strong consumption growth
Job gains and the spending of some of the savings accumulated during the 
pandemic will support consumption growth (Chart 14). Moreover, the lifting of 
public health restrictions should lead to a continued rebound in spending on 
hard‑to‑distance services in the second half of 2022. Consumption of these 
services will grow at a slower but still‑solid pace thereafter, as pandemic‑
induced caution fades.

In contrast, overall goods consumption is forecast to grow at a more 
moderate pace. As a result, the balance of consumption between goods and 
services will return toward pre‑pandemic levels over the projection horizon. 
While consumption growth for most goods will moderate, spending on motor 
vehicles should pick up as supply challenges in the auto sector are resolved. 

Housing activity is projected to ease from its current level but remain 
elevated, supported by population growth. Resales are expected to soften 
as borrowing rates rise and the pandemic‑induced demand for more housing 
space wanes. Meanwhile, the unwinding of supply chain bottlenecks should 
support new construction as sourcing building materials becomes easier. 
This growth in housing supply, combined with slowing demand, should help 
rebalance housing markets over time and help moderate house price growth.

Robust export growth
Export growth is expected to be strong in 2022 and 2023, boosted by 
elevated commodity prices and solid foreign demand coupled with easing 
supply constraints (Chart 15). Later in the projection, exports are anticipated 
to continue to grow but at a slower pace.

Energy exports are projected to grow strongly because of high prices and 
increased transportation capacity. Canadian producers are expected to make 
full use of existing production and transportation capacity to boost energy 
exports in 2022. Expansions in crude‑by‑rail and pipeline capacity, including 
the scheduled completion of the Trans Mountain Expansion project, will 
support growth later in the projection horizon.

Non‑energy goods exports should grow solidly, supported by the gradual 
dissipation of global supply disruptions. However, exports of motor vehicles 
are expected to remain flat after the second quarter of 2022, reflecting supply 
issues, before declining later in the projection due to restructuring in the 
sector. Services exports and imports are anticipated to strengthen as travel 
recovers, but the recovery is expected to take time given the slow return of 
international tourism.

Goods imports will be supported by strong domestic demand as well as the 
willingness of firms to invest and rebuild inventories as supply chain issues 
ease.

Stronger business investment after pandemic lows
Business investment is expected to grow strongly (Chart 16). Investment 
growth in the oil and gas sector is anticipated to be robust as a result of high 
energy prices. Heightened global concerns over secure energy supplies 
should also benefit Canadian producers. However, investment will be 
restrained by labour shortages and ongoing uncertainty about long‑term 
demand and the transition to a low‑carbon economy.

Bank of Canada calculations and projections 

Outside the oil and gas sector, investment will be supported by robust 
demand, the gradual easing of supply constraints and improved business 
confidence. The outlook is consistent with the results of the BOS, as most 
businesses said they intend to increase their spending on machinery and 
equipment. This level of investment intentions was a near‑record high for the 
survey. More firms also reported plans to invest in digital technologies and 
automation to improve productivity given tight labour markets and rising input 
costs.

Inventory investment is projected to contribute to growth in 2022 and 2023 as 
businesses, notably retailers, restock following pandemic shortages.

CPI inflation to decline from second-quarter peak
Inflation is expected to ease over the projection horizon as the effects of high 
energy prices and supply disruptions fade and monetary policy tightening 
moderates demand (Chart 17).
With oil prices assumed to decline after the second quarter of 2022, the 
boost from higher gasoline prices should fade quickly in coming quarters. 
Upward pressure from supply challenges is also expected to dissipate 
over 2023. This is consistent with the assumption that the prices for goods 
affected by supply challenges will not experience price reversals. This 
anticipated easing in inflationary pressures can be seen in the dynamic of 
annualized quarter‑over‑quarter inflation rates, which fall from around 6% 
in the second quarter of 2022 to about 2½% in the fourth quarter. Year‑
over‑year inflation is anticipated to decrease from about 5¾% in the second 
quarter of 2022 to about 2½% in the second half of 2023. Inflation is then 
expected to decline to the 2% target in 2024.

Rising short-term and stable long-term inflation 
expectations 
Inflation has been above 3% since the second quarter of 2021. When 
combined with the outlook, this suggests that inflation is expected to be 
above the top end of the inflation control range for two years. There is a 
concern that high and persistent inflation can affect long‑term inflation 
expectations. This matters because inflation expectations are an important 
factor behind future inflation.

The inflation expectations of consumers have increased at the one‑year 
horizon (Chart 18). Evidence about the evolution of inflation expectations 
at the two‑year horizon is mixed. Inflation expectations of professional 
forecasters remain relatively stable, but those of consumers and businesses 
have increased significantly. Most respondents to both the BOS and the 
Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations for the first quarter of 2022 
anticipate inflation will be well above 3% on average over the next two years.

Current high inflation has not, however, resulted in increases in survey‑
based expectations at longer horizons. Most respondents to the BOS 
anticipate inflation will be close to the 2% target in three years because of 
improvements in supply chains and the Bank’s interest rate actions. Inflation 
expectations also remain relatively stable at the five‑year horizon for both 
consumers and professional forecasters.2 

2 

It is common in household surveys of inflation that the absolute level is higher than the inflation target. 
As such, it is the directional change that matters most. For instance, see C. D. Carroll, “Macroeconomic 
Expectations of Households and Professional Forecasters.” Quarterly Journal of Economics 118, no. 1 
(2003): 269–298.

the difference between the yields of a nominal bond and a real return bond of the same maturity, both issued by the Government of Canada. Break‑even infl ation rates 
provide a signal about the expected path of infl ation as perceived by market participants, but they are also affected by fl uctuations in infl ation risk and liquidity premiums.

The five‑year break‑even inflation rate (BEIR) has increased to near 3%. At 
this level, the five‑year BEIR is consistent with a rise in inflation over the near 
term followed by a decline toward the 2% target. In this respect, the five‑year 
BEIR is indicative that longer‑term inflation expectations are consistent with 
the Bank’s projection for inflation.

Evolution of the Bank of 
Evolution of the Bank of 
Canada’s balance sheet
Canada’s balance sheet

Since November 2021, the Bank has been in the reinvestment phase. 
This means that the Bank has been purchasing Government of Canada 
(GoC) bonds solely to replace maturing bonds. This requires approximately 
$4 billion to $5 billion in purchases every month, across both the primary and 
secondary markets. 

Ending the reinvestment phase and initiating quantitative tightening means 
that the Bank will stop purchasing GoC bonds. Maturing bonds will not be 
replaced when they roll off the balance sheet. As a result, the Bank’s balance 
sheet will shrink over time, with roughly 40% of the Bank’s GoC bond 
holdings maturing within the next two years. 

The longer‑run level of settlement balances will be higher than it was before 
the pandemic. This reflects a variety of factors, including a shift in investor 
preferences toward safe and liquid assets, changes to the payment system 
in Canada and regulatory requirements that encourage greater use of central 
bank deposits.

RISKS TO THE INFlATION OUTlOOK  26 

Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook

The disruptions related to the COVID‑19 pandemic have diminished, but 
Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has introduced a major new source 
of uncertainty. Global trade is being disrupted, confidence is declining, and 
financial markets have been volatile. Moreover, the tragic situation in Ukraine 
has ignited fears of wider escalation and risks to global economic integration.

A quick end to the war would be positive for global growth and would reduce 
inflationary pressures. In contrast, a prolonged or worsening conflict would 
lower confidence, add further stress to supply chains and boost inflation.

Regarding COVID‑19, greater population‑wide immunity has led to the 
removal of public health restrictions and the reopening of economies in 
most jurisdictions around the world. While the likelihood of another severe 
downturn has diminished, the virus continues to circulate and mutate. Even 
without a resurgence of cases, reopening an economy remains complex, and 
pervasive supply constraints have yet to be unwound.

Some of the risks identified in previous reports have been partially 
incorporated into the projection. For example, the base‑case scenario 
includes more persistent supply‑side disruptions and an upward revision to 
residential investment.

Outside of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the Bank sees several 
upside and downside risks to the outlook for inflation. The Bank views these 
risks as roughly balanced. Nonetheless, the upside risks are of greater 
concern because inflation is very high. Until inflation moves significantly 
lower, there is an elevated risk that Canadians will start to believe that it will 
stay high over the long term. Higher inflation expectations could in turn lead 
to more pervasive increases in labour costs and inflationary pressures and 
could become embedded in ongoing inflation.

Drawing from a larger set of risks, the Bank presents here a selection of 
those identified as most important for the projected path of inflation.

(i)  More persistent supply bottlenecks and cost pressures (↑)
Disruptions such as the spread of COVID‑19 variants could further affect 
manufacturing and shipping activities, causing persistent shortages of 
goods and labour. In particular, some countries that have had relatively 
low infection rates to date, such as China, could be subject to more 
frequent and widespread lockdowns. A drawn‑out war in Ukraine could 
also create additional supply bottlenecks or worsen existing ones even 
further. Over time, repeated disruptions to business operations may lead 
firms to adjust their supply chains in ways that could increase costs. 
More persistent labour shortages could also result in wages rising much 
faster than productivity growth. Taken together, these effects would lead 
to greater and longer‑lasting inflationary pressures.

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POlICy REPORT  •  APRIl 2022

RISKS TO THE INFlATION OUTlOOK  27 

(ii)  Reversal of growth in goods prices (↓)

The base‑case scenario assumes that the sharp increase in the level 
of prices of durables seen since the pandemic began will persist. 
However, as supply chain bottlenecks dissipate, these prices could 
decline. Moreover, oil prices and transportation costs could decrease 
more sharply, or goods consumption could slow faster than projected. 
If this occurred, inflation would be lower than projected.

(iii)  Stronger household spending in Canada (↑)

The projection continues to include some degree of caution around 
consumption. However, further reductions in pandemic‑related 
uncertainty could boost confidence by more than expected. 
Consequently, households could spend more of their accumulated 
savings. Consumption and residential investment would then be 
stronger than projected and would contribute to greater inflationary 
pressures.

(iv)  Sharp deterioration of global financial conditions (↓)
Global indebtedness levels, equity valuations and inflationary 
pressures are all high. These, combined with reduced policy support, 
could result in a pullback in risk appetite and a sharp tightening of 
global financial conditions. This would constrain access to credit for 
vulnerable EMEs or other highly indebted borrowers. In addition, 
China’s efforts to address vulnerabilities and engineer a soft landing 
in the property sector could weigh on financial markets more than 
expected. These shocks could have negative spillover effects on the 
global economy and would be transmitted to the Canadian economy 
through a sharp tightening of financial conditions, weaker exports, 
lower commodity prices and a deterioration in the terms of trade.

The estimated range for the Canadian nominal neutral rate of interest 
has been revised up by 25 basis points compared with the April 2021

Modest increase in global potential output growth
Global potential output growth is expected to continue recovering from the 
pandemic, rising from 2.7% in 2021 to 2.9% over the following three years 
(Table A‑1). The recovery is observed in all regions except China, where 
potential output growth should continue moderating, largely reflecting 
population aging and slower capital accumulation. In the United States, 
potential output growth is expected to rise from 1.3% in 2021 to 1.8% in 
2024. This increase is mainly due to easing immigration restrictions and 
accelerating trend labour productivity growth as impacts from the pandemic 
fade and firms invest in new and digital technologies. 

Compared with the April 2021 assessment, global potential output growth 
is marginally lower over the projection horizon. This reflects downward 
revisions to potential output for China, the United States and emerging‑
market economies. These downward revisions are partially offset by upward 
revisions for other regions.

Canadian potential output growth to strengthen
In Canada, the growth of potential output, including the effects of temporary 
factors, is expected to decline from 2.3% in 2021 to 1.7% in 2022 because 
of lingering supply chain issues.4 It is then projected to increase to 2.7% on 
average over 2023 to 2025. The resolution of supply disruptions explains 
much of this anticipated pickup, alongside stronger population growth due to 
higher immigration levels. 

Relative to the April 2021 assessment, potential output growth (including 
temporary factors) is revised down by 1.4 percentage points in 2021, but 
is revised up by an average of 0.6 percentage points over 2022 to 2024 
(Table A‑2).

APPENDIx: POTENTIAl OUTPUT AND THE NEUTRAl RATE OF INTEREST  30 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POlICy REPORT  •  APRIl 2022

The downward revision in 2021 largely reflects pressures from global supply 
chain disruptions that emerged over the year and that are expected to 
remain elevated in the first half of 2022 before gradually easing. The faster‑
than‑anticipated labour market recovery and lower expected impact of the 
pandemic on labour market scarring contribute to upward revisions in trend 
labour input from 2022 to 2024.

Potential output is highly uncertain because some of its components are 
unobservable and difficult to forecast. To reflect this uncertainty, a range is 
constructed around midpoint estimates. The outlook for potential output is 
subject to both upside and downside risks. In particular, Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine could have a larger‑than‑anticipated impact on global supply chains, 
weighing on potential output growth even more.

International travel and quarantine restrictions that are still in place in many 
countries could continue to present challenges for Canada in reaching its 
immigration targets, posing a downside risk to growth in trend labour input. 
In contrast, refugees from Ukraine, who to date are concentrated throughout 
Europe, could migrate to Canada in greater numbers than currently expected, 
which may strengthen potential output.

Higher neutral rate of interest
The Bank estimates that the nominal neutral rate in Canada currently 
lies in a range of 2% to 3%, 25 basis points higher than in the April 2021 
assessment.5 This upward shift reflects a combination of the revised US 
neutral rate (described below) and key domestic factors, including stronger 
growth of trend labour input and trend output over the long term.6

The small open nature of the Canadian economy implies that its neutral 
rate is linked with the global neutral rate, which the Bank proxies using an 
estimate of the US neutral rate. The Bank’s estimate for the nominal US 
neutral rate currently lies within a range of 2% to 3%, 25 basis points higher 
than in the April 2021 assessment.7 This is largely because the medium‑term 
impact of the COVID‑19 recession on US income inequality is now projected 
to be smaller than that estimated in April 2021.

5  Unlike the potential output assessment, the Bank’s neutral rate assessment is conducted only on a 
forward‑looking basis. It therefore aims to estimate the level of the neutral rate consistent with Bank 
staff’s current medium‑ to long‑term outlook rather than with a complete historical path.

Canada’s Inflation-Control Strategy1
Inflation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to pro-
mote the economic and financial well-being of Canadians.

  Canada’s experience with inflation targeting since 

1991 has shown that the best way to foster confidence 
in the value of money and to contribute to sustained 
economic growth, employment gains and improved 
living standards is by keeping inflation low, stable and 
predictable.

  In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada 

renewed Canada’s inflation-control target for a further 
five-year period, ending 31 December 2021. The target, 
as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), remains 
at the 2 per cent midpoint of the control range of 1 to 
3 per cent.

The monetary policy instrument
  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes 

in the target for the overnight rate of interest.2 These 
changes are transmitted to the economy through their 
influence on market interest rates, domestic asset prices 
and the exchange rate, which affect total demand for 
Canadian goods and services. The balance between 
this demand and the economy’s production capacity is, 
over time, the primary determinant of inflation pressures 
in the economy.

  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to 
eight quarters—to work their way through the economy 
and have their full effect on inflation. For this reason, 
monetary policy must be forward-looking.

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent 

communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspec-
tive on the forces at work on the economy and their 
implications for inflation. The Monetary Policy Report 
is a key element of this approach. Policy decisions are 
typically announced on eight pre-set days during the 

year, and full updates of the Bank’s outlook, including 
risks to the projection, are published four times per year 
in the Monetary Policy Report.

Inflation targeting is symmetric and flexible
  Canada’s inflation-targeting approach is symmetric, 

which means that the Bank is equally concerned about 
inflation rising above or falling below the 2 per cent target.

  Canada’s inflation-targeting framework is flexible. 

Typically, the Bank seeks to return inflation to target over 
a horizon of six to eight quarters. However, the most 
appropriate horizon for returning inflation to target will 
vary depending on the nature and persistence of the 
shocks buffeting the economy.

Monitoring inflation
  In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components 
can be particularly volatile. These components, as well 
as changes in indirect taxes such as GST, can cause 
sizable fluctuations in CPI.

  In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look 

through such transitory movements in CPI inflation and 
focuses on a set of “core” inflation measures that better 
reflect the underlying trend of inflation. In this sense, 
these measures act as an operational guide to help the 
Bank achieve the CPI inflation target. They are not a 
replacement for CPI inflation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core inflation 
are CPI-trim, which excludes CPI components whose 
rates of change in a given month are the most extreme; 
CPI-median, which corresponds to the price change 
located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket weight) 
of the distribution of price changes; and CPI-common, 
which uses a statistical procedure to track common 
price changes across categories in the CPI basket.

1  See Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target (24 October 2016) and Renewal of the 

Inflation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide additional  monetary 

stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website, describes 
these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Global Economy

Recent data point to a somewhat stronger pickup in global economic 
growth than had been expected at the time of the January Monetary Policy 
Report. However, the considerable uncertainty noted in January, particularly 
regarding US economic policy, continues to cloud the outlook. This uncer-
tainty is expected to persist as the possible changes under consideration, 
notably in relation to fiscal and trade policies, would involve complex and 
probably lengthy negotiations and changes to legislation (Box 1).

With inflation strengthening and the labour market nearing full employment, 
the US Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate by 25 basis points 
in mid-March. Even with this step toward normalization, US monetary policy 
remains accommodative. Financial conditions globally continue to support 
growth. 

Global economic growth is projected to increase from around 3 1/4 per cent 
in 2017 to about 3 1/2 per cent over 2018–19 (Table 1), broadly unchanged 
since January. This projection incorporates a slower track for global poten-
tial growth than previously assumed (Box 2). The uncertainty around US 
trade policy is also now expected to dampen the pickup in trade and invest-
ment growth globally.

Box 1

Potential Implications of a Rise in Trade Protectionism
An increase in protectionist policies could, depending on 
their degree and extent, have a signifi cant impact on the 
Canadian and global economies . The rapid pace of trade 
liberalization from the late 1980s to the early 2000s helped 
increase global economic growth, for example, through the 
development of global value chains, which boosted invest-
ment and productivity .
A notable global shift toward increased trade protectionism 
would pose a risk not only to short-run demand but also to 
long-run growth and prosperity . A move to a signifi cantly 
less-integrated global economy could also involve a lengthy 
adjustment process and could require a diﬃ  cult reallocation 
of workers and resources across industries .
Economic theory suggests that the overall impact of 
increased protectionism on aggregate economic growth 
would be negative . It would, however, have complex and 
uneven eﬀ ects on prices, profi ts, jobs and wages in diﬀ erent 
sectors of the economy . Adding to the complexity is the 
fact that trade can be inhibited, not only by tariﬀ s but also 
by a wide range of non-tariﬀ  barriers such as import quotas, 
subsidies for domestic producers and regulations faced 
only by foreign producers . Changes to trade rules can there-
fore generate considerable uncertainty for businesses and 
consumers and are diﬃ  cult to incorporate into economic 
forecasts . Such uncertainty could be dampening business 
investment in Canada and in some other countries, such as 
Mexico .
Economic theory and trade models can, nevertheless, help 
us better understand some of the channels through which 
protectionism works .

by higher prices for imported intermediate goods, as 
well as by the real exchange rate appreciation that would 
typically result .

Although increased trade protectionism may help some 
domestic producers in the short run, it may have substantial 
long-run costs:
•  Net entry of fi rms into the domestic market could be 
higher because marginal fi rms face less competition 
from foreign businesses . This dynamic tends to lower 
productivity as resources are reallocated toward 
less-productive fi rms .

•  Global value chains could be disrupted, reducing pro-

ductivity through a less-eﬃ  cient international division of 
labour and fewer knowledge spillovers .

To the extent that protectionist measures undermine pro-
ductivity, the costs are ultimately borne by households: 
•  Restrictive trade policies increase consumer prices and 

reduce overall real incomes—directly, through higher 
prices for imported fi nal consumption goods, and 
indirectly, through a loss in the productivity of fi rms .
•  The impact of protectionist policies may diﬀ er across 
consumers depending on their income levels . Lower-
income households would be more aﬀ ected, given 
their greater reliance on traded goods (e .g ., food and 
beverages) . Low-income earners may also face greater 
challenges in fi nding new jobs as the economy adjusts to 
changing trade rules .

Trade policy changes would also be transmitted through 
exchange rate movements since changing trade patterns 
would aﬀ ect underlying economic fundamentals .

In the country imposing protectionist measures
While fi rms, workers and suppliers to the protected indus-
tries would benefi t initially, other domestic producers stand 
to lose:
•  The reduction in imports increases employment in 

the protected industries, while lower output in other 
industries (including those involved in the production 
of exports as well as non-tradable goods and services) 
decreases employment . Thus, while some jobs are cre-
ated, others are lost .

•  Protectionist policies encourage greater domestic output 

of protected goods, shifting resources away from other, 
potentially more-productive industries . The competitive-
ness of other industries may also be negatively aﬀ ected 

In other countries
New protectionist measures would act through similar 
channels in other countries . In the country facing trade 
barriers, output would decline in targeted industries, 
 providing an incentive to reallocate resources to poten-
tially less-productive sectors, which would undermine 
productivity and living standards . The exchange rate of 
the country facing protectionist policies would depreciate, 
helping to increase its exports to the rest of the world . 
These exchange rate eﬀ ects would likely be more than 
oﬀ set by lower global demand .

If the restrictions are applied selectively to exports from 
certain countries, producers in other countries could benefi t 
from trade diversion, since their products would be rela-
tively cheaper . But if such measures lower real incomes 
(both in the countries imposing the restrictions and in those 
directly aﬀ ected), demand for the exports of other countries 
would also be lower .
To sum up, the nature and extent of the impact of increased 
trade protectionism would ultimately depend on several fac-
tors, including the type of measures adopted, the industries 
or sectors targeted and whether its implementation triggers 
retaliatory actions . In a more adverse scenario, the negative 
eﬀ ects on global trade and growth could be further ampli-
fi ed if protectionism caused a more generalized decline 
in cross-border co-operation . Unlike the removal of trade 
barriers, the gains from protectionism would be insuﬃ  cient 
to compensate the individuals and businesses that lose .

Implications for Canada
As noted in previous Reports, recent developments in some 
advanced economies, notably the United States, suggest 
that more-restrictive trade policies are possible . The Bank’s 
base-case projection includes only the estimated impact of 
prolonged and elevated trade policy uncertainty on trade 
and investment globally and in Canada . The scope and 
magnitude of possible new US trade policy represents a 
signifi cant source of uncertainty . Such measures, if applied 
to Canada, would have a direct adverse eﬀ ect on exports . 
US measures targeted at other countries would have more 
complex eﬀ ects on Canadian exports but would likely be 
negative, given the dampening eﬀ ects on global trade and 
economic growth, particularly if they elicit retaliation from 
other countries . Additional negative eﬀ ects on productivity 
and potential growth are also possible should there be a 
reversal of the process of globalization—particularly the 
unwinding of global value chains .

Estimates of Global Potential Output Growth
Global potential output growth is estimated to have 
reached a trough of around 3 per cent in 2016, after steadily 
declining from its pre-crisis peak of 5 per cent in 2006 .1, 2 
A modest rise to around 3 1/2 per cent is expected by 2019 
(Chart 2-A) . This is driven primarily by growth-enhancing 
structural reforms in emerging-market economies (EMEs) 
other than China .3 China, meanwhile, is expected to see a 
slowing in potential output growth, refl ecting the structural 
transition away from investment-led growth and, to a lesser 
extent, the eﬀ ects of an aging population . The rise in global 
potential output growth is somewhat weaker than previ-
ously estimated as a result of lower levels of investment in 
commodity exporters and delays in implementing some 
reforms in EMEs and the euro area .
US potential output growth has recovered from its post-
crisis low of around 1 1/4 per cent, refl ecting in part a 
cyclical recovery in productivity growth . The rate of poten-
tial output growth remains well below the 3 to 3 1/2 per 
cent range of the early 2000s, however . The outlook for 
US potential output growth over the projection is around

 April Report

 January Report

Global financial conditions are helping to support growth, 
amid risks
Yields on long-term sovereign bonds are broadly unchanged since the 
January Report and remain low by historical standards, reflecting in part 
ongoing quantitative easing in some advanced economies. Equity prices are 
higher and credit spreads are narrower than in January, partly in response 
to improved expectations for global growth. Measures of market volatility 
across most asset classes have been relatively low, in contrast to continuing 
high levels of uncertainty in relation to US trade policy and perceptions 
of significant political risk, for example, in Europe. In foreign exchange 
markets, the Canadian dollar is little changed against the US dollar but has 
depreciated against the currencies of other important trade partners, such 
as Mexico (Chart 2).

Last observation: 7 April 2017

The US economy is expected to grow at a moderate pace  
The US economy is anticipated to grow at around 2 per cent over the pro-
jection horizon, amid unusually high levels of policy uncertainty. Temporary 
factors, including a weather-related decline in the consumption of utilities, 
likely explain most of the weakness in first-quarter growth. The fiscal 
stimulus incorporated into the projection is now assumed to begin some-
what later than in the January projection, reflecting possible legislative chal-
lenges. Potential output growth has also been adjusted lower (Box 2).

Strong domestic fundamentals should continue to underpin a moderate 
pace of growth. Consumption growth is expected to remain solid, supported 
by anticipated tax cuts and a strong labour market (Chart 3). Residential 
investment, meanwhile, is projected to grow at a robust pace, given rising 
household income and demographic demand. Although business invest-
ment was a source of drag in 2016, growth was positive in the latter part 
of the year and should continue to recover, given the rebound in energy 
investment and the strong prospects for domestic demand. Net exports, in 
contrast, are expected to remain a drag on growth, given the past apprecia-
tion of the US dollar and a boost in imports from firm domestic demand. 

While the timing and nature of US fiscal policy changes remain unknown, 
the base-case projection embeds fiscal stimulus that is assumed to boost 
the level of gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.5 per cent by mid-2019. The 
cumulative amount of stimulus is the same as that built into the January 
Report, but it has been delayed in the projection given indications that it will 
take longer than previously anticipated to implement corporate and personal

tax cuts. Starting in 2019, expenditure cuts are now expected to modestly 
dampen the amount of fiscal stimulus. These assumptions will continue to 
be updated as the budgetary process unfolds.  

With the labour market close to full employment and core inflation increasing, 
markets expect several further increases in the federal funds rate in 2017 and 
beyond (Chart 4). This contrasts with other major economies such as the 
euro area and Japan, where economic recoveries are not as advanced and 
monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative for longer.

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLICy REPORT  •  APRIL 2017

Prospects in the euro area have improved but remain 
modest 
The outlook for economic growth in the euro area has strengthened in 
recent months. Increased lending to households and a rebound in resi-
dential investment supported growth in the latter part of 2016, and recent 
indicators suggest a faster-than-anticipated pace of expansion in 2017. 
Highly accommodative monetary conditions and an improving labour market 
have underpinned this progress and should continue to sustain domestic 
demand. The pace of expansion should nevertheless remain modest, at 
around 1 1/2 per cent, over the projection horizon, tempered by slow poten-
tial output growth and political uncertainty.

In Japan, domestic demand has been more sluggish than expected in 
January and should continue to be restrained by tepid wage growth. 
Economic growth has therefore become more reliant on exports, which have 
been supported by a weaker yen and robust demand from emerging Asia. 
Overall, growth is projected to remain at around 1 per cent over 2017–19, in 
line with expectations in the January Report.

Emerging-market economies have more near-term 
momentum
The Chinese economy has performed more strongly than expected in 
January. A boost in investment resulted in faster-than-expected growth at 
the end of 2016, while recent data suggest a stronger-than-anticipated start 
to 2017. China’s economic rebalancing toward more consumption-based 
growth is occurring in an environment of elevated financial vulnerabilities. 
In managing the transition, Chinese authorities have been seeking to main-
tain growth while taking steps to address these vulnerabilities through, for 
example, restrictions on new housing purchases and selective tightening of 
lending rates. Capital outflows seem to have moderated, partly reflecting 
last year’s tightening of capital controls. Overall, growth in China is expected 
to ease gradually over the projection horizon, from 6.5 per cent in 2017 to 
6.3 per cent in 2018–19.

Incoming data show that the pace of economic activity has also improved 
in other oil-importing emerging-market economies (EMEs), particularly in 
Asia. This is in contrast to Brazil, where the economic contraction has been 
deeper than expected but should ease over the projection, helped in part 
by past increases in commodity prices. Overall, the pace of GDP growth in 
oil-importing EMEs is expected to continue to strengthen, from 3.7 per cent 
in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2019, supported by a return to positive growth in 
some distressed economies. This pickup is more modest than expected in 
the January Report, however, reflecting a downward revision to potential 
growth primarily because of delays in implementing growth-enhancing 
structural reforms. 

Potential growth has also been revised down in oil-exporting countries, 
including Saudi Arabia and Russia, reflecting weaker investment following 
past oil price declines. As a result, the anticipated rebound in economic 
growth in the “rest of the world” grouping is now expected to be weaker 
than indicated in January, rising from about 2 per cent in 2017 to around 
2 3/4 per cent by 2019, as the drag from past oil price declines dissipates.

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLICy REPORT  •  APRIL 2017

Commodity prices are largely unchanged
Oil prices have been relatively stable since January, reflecting a number 
of offsetting factors. Demand has been stronger than expected, and there 
has been a reportedly high degree of compliance with cuts agreed to in 
December by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) 
and some other oil producers. Market concerns about oversupply have been 
reinforced, however, by unexpected increases in US crude oil inventories 
and the rising rig count in shale oil fields in the United States (Chart 5).

Oil prices are subject to both upside and downside risks. On the upside, 
the substantial reductions in investment since 2014, coupled with rising 
demand, may mean there is insufficient capacity to satisfy demand over 
the medium term. This potential upside risk is attenuated by technological 
advances that have continued to bring down the costs of unconventional 
oil production. There are also important short-term downside risks. In 
particular, the break-even costs of US shale oil suppliers may be lower 
than expected, and the production agreement between OPEC and some  
non-OPEC oil producers may not be renewed.

Some non-energy commodity prices have increased modestly since 
January. Lumber prices have risen in light of the Canada–US softwood 
lumber dispute, reflecting a slowdown in lumber shipments since new duties 
could be applied retroactively, as well as ongoing robust housing demand in 
the United States. Base metal prices are somewhat higher, driven by global 
supply disruptions and past production cuts. Looking ahead, the Bank of 
Canada’s non-energy commodity price index should remain near its current 
level, with further upward pressure on certain components such as base 
metals largely offset by small declines in other categories.

Canadian Economy

Economic growth in Canada in recent quarters has been stronger than 
expected in the January Report, but the composition of aggregate demand 
has been uneven. In the oil and gas sector, a resumption of growth in invest-
ment spending is under way in the wake of significant adjustments to past 
declines in commodity prices. This contributed, together with very strong 
consumption and residential investment, to a temporary surge in growth 
in the first quarter. In contrast, non-commodity business investment and 
exports remain weak, raising questions about the medium-term sustain-
ability of the upturn.

Over the forecast horizon, the Bank expects the economy to continue to 
grow, but at a more moderate pace. Economic activity will be supported by 
rising foreign demand, federal fiscal stimulus and accommodative monetary 
and financial conditions. In addition, the composition of demand growth is 
expected to broaden: the pace of household expenditures, especially resi-
dential investment, moderates as the contributions from exports and busi-
ness investment increase, albeit at a much slower pace than would normally 
be expected at this stage of the cycle. Ongoing competitiveness challenges 
and uncertainty surrounding the prospects for global trade are expected to 
limit this broadening of growth. A notable increase in global protectionism 
remains the most important source of uncertainty facing the Canadian 
economy. 

Largely reflecting temporary strength at the start of the year, real GDP is 
anticipated to expand by 2.6 per cent in 2017, before slowing to 1.9 per cent 
in 2018 and 1.8 per cent in 2019 (Table 2 and Box 3). The Bank’s projection 
for potential output growth has been revised down. The output gap is now 
expected to close in the first half of 2018, somewhat sooner than projected 
in January.

Relative price movements, especially higher consumer energy prices, 
helped boost inflation in the first quarter of 2017, but their effect is expected 
to be temporary. In contrast, the Bank’s preferred measures of core infla-
tion have drifted down in recent quarters and remain below 2 per cent, 
consistent with material excess capacity in the Canadian economy. As in 
January, the Bank expects CPI inflation to remain close to 2 per cent over 
the projection horizon as the effects of the relative price movements dis-
sipate and excess supply is absorbed.

Key Inputs to the Base-Case Projection
The Bank’s projection is always conditional on several key 
assumptions, and changes to them will aﬀ ect the outlook 
for the global and Canadian economies . The Bank regularly 
reviews these assumptions and assesses the sensitivity of 
the economic projection to them .
•  Oil prices are assumed to remain near their average 

levels at the time the projection is conducted . The 
per-barrel prices in US dollars for Brent, West Texas 
Intermediate and Western Canada Select are about $55, 
$50 and $35, respectively, in line with the assumption in 
the January Report .

•  By convention, the Bank does not attempt to forecast 

the exchange rate in the base-case projection . Therefore, 
over the projection horizon, the Canadian dollar is 
assumed to remain close to its average of 75 cents 
observed at the time the projection is conducted . This 
assumption is unchanged from the January Report .

•  The output gap is assumed to show excess capacity of 
3/4 per cent in the fi rst quarter of 2017, based on the 
midpoint of the Bank’s estimate that excess capacity in 
the Canadian economy was in a range of 1 1/4 to 1/4 per 

cent .1 This assumption compares with the January 
assumption of 1 1/4 per cent excess capacity for the 
fourth quarter of 2016 .

•  Potential output growth is assumed to increase gradually 

from a trough of 1 .3 per cent in 2017 to 1 .6 per cent by 
2020 . This assumption is revised down relative to the 
January assumption . Details on the Bank’s assessment of 
potential output are provided in the Appendix on page 25 .

•  The neutral nominal policy rate in Canada is estimated 

to be between 2 .5 and 3 .5 per cent, 25 basis points 
lower than previously estimated . The current projection 
is based on the midpoint of this range . 

1  The level of potential output is estimated to be about 0 .4 per cent higher in the 

fi rst quarter than projected in the January Report, while the level of GDP is revised 
up by 0 .7 per cent . The revision to the level of potential output is due to recent 
analysis that informs the Bank’s annual reassessment of all the factors aﬀ ecting 
productive capacity as well as new data . In particular, the positive revisions to 
business investment (by Statistics Canada) before the oil price shock, slightly 
higher population growth resulting from an increase in the number of immigrants 
arriving in Canada in 2016 and the higher overall level of GDP in recent quarters 
suggest that productive capacity is currently higher than previously assessed .

Recent strong growth is expected to moderate
Growth in Canadian GDP in the fourth quarter of 2016 surpassed expecta-
tions in January (Table 3). Robust household spending, increased govern-
ment expenditures and, to a lesser extent, modest exports supported 
growth (Chart 6). The positive surprise was concentrated in residential 
investment, a smaller-than-anticipated inventory drawdown and a larger 
pullback in imports. In contrast, final domestic demand, a key ingredient for 
a sustained improvement in economic activity, was weaker than projected. 
In particular, business investment declined, and government capital forma-
tion remained subdued, the latter consistent with reported delays in infra-
structure spending.1

Canadian EConoMy 
BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLICy REPORT  •  APRIL 2017

The estimate for economic activity in the first quarter of 2017 has been 
revised up, to 3.8 per cent from the 2.5 per cent expected in the January 
Report (Table 3). GDP growth in the quarter increased partly because of 
a resumption of investment growth in the oil and gas sector after a long 
period of steep declines. Market intelligence suggests that this pace of 
growth is unlikely to continue in the current price environment. Consumption 
growth was also very strong, partially as a result of a temporary boost from 
the Canada Child Benefit. As well, motor vehicle sales reached an all-time 
high, a pace that is well above expected annual demand. Similarly, housing 
activity rose sharply to a pace that is unlikely to be sustained given the 
economic fundamentals. Given all of these factors as well as weak non-
commodity investment and exports, the Bank expects real GDP growth to 
moderate to 2.5 per cent in the second quarter.

Economic slack remains material 
While the degree of excess capacity has declined since the January Report, 
the Bank judges that in the first quarter of 2017 it remains material, between 
1 1/4 and 1/4 per cent. 

To help manage the considerable uncertainty surrounding the estimation 
of the output gap, the Bank places equal weight on the estimates from its 
two approaches (one is statistical or mechanical and the other is structural), 
recognizing that each approach has certain strengths and weaknesses.2 
Consequently, the two approaches can suggest different assessments of the 
degree of slack in the economy. For example, in the face of persistently weak 
economic activity, the statistical method tends to attribute more of the weakness 
to lower potential output than does the structural method. 

The labour market provides another perspective from which to assess the 
degree of excess capacity. Employment growth has remained firm at the 
national level. However, weak growth in both hours worked and wages, 
together with no improvement in the Bank’s labour market indicator over the 
past year, suggests that the workforce remains underutilized. In contrast, 
the labour market in the United States is now close to full employment and 
wages are increasing at a solid pace (Box 4).

With growth in unit labour costs subdued and the Bank’s measures of core 
inflation below 2 per cent, it is possible that the degree of excess supply 
in the economy could be larger than the midpoint would suggest (see the 
Risks section on page 21). 

Temporary factors have recently boosted inflation 
After reaching a low of 1.2 per cent in November 2016, CPI inflation rose to 
2.0 per cent in February, largely because of higher consumer energy prices. 
For the first quarter of 2017, the anticipated rise in CPI inflation is now some-
what larger than expected at the time of the January Report. This surprise 
reflects stronger increases in prices for passenger vehicles and some ser-
vices (notably hotels and intercity transportation), which were partly offset 
by weaker retail food prices. The impact of all these relative price move-
ments on inflation is expected to be temporary.

2  While the statistical and structural approaches are key inputs into the Bank’s assessment of potential 

output, other models and sources of information are also taken into account. The Bank’s structural and 
statistical estimates of the output gap can be found at Statistics > Indicators > Indicators of Capacity 
and Inflation Pressures for Canada on the Bank’s website. For details on these approaches, see 
L. Pichette, P. St-Amant, B. Tomlin and K. Anoma, “Measuring Potential Output at the Bank of Canada:

No. 2015-1 (January 2015).

A Comparison of the Recent Evolution of Canadian and US Labour Markets
Material slack remains in the Canadian labour market and 
wage growth is subdued . In contrast, various indicators sug-
gest the US labour market is now close to full employment, 
and wage growth has risen steadily since 2014.1
An important driver of this diﬀ erence is the collapse in 
oil and other commodity prices in mid-2014 . Lower com-
modity prices have had materially diﬀ erent impacts on the 
Canadian and US economies, with Canada more adversely 
aﬀ ected than the United States . Unlike the United States, 
Canada is a net exporter of commodities, and the fall in 
commodity prices therefore led to a deterioration in its 
terms of trade and thus the purchasing power of Canadians . 
Furthermore, the commodity sector represents a larger 
share of the Canadian economy than of the US economy .
As shown in (Chart 4-A), the unemployment rate has 
remained steady in Canada since the end of 2014 . In 
comparison, the US unemployment rate has continued to 
decline over the same period .2 This diﬀ erence across labour 
markets also emerges in other indicators . For example, 
US fi rms report that it is increasingly diﬃ  cult to fi ll open 
positions, leading to near-all-time-high job openings and 
near-all-time-low layoﬀ s—both signals of labour market 
tightness . In Canada, however, the job vacancy rate has 
not changed signifi cantly relative to early 2015, and it has 
decreased in energy-intensive provinces .3
More recently, growth in total hours worked in Canada has 
been weak relative to that in the United States, despite 
strong job gains in the past year (Chart 4-B) . The weak-
ness in total hours worked is driven by a steep decline 
in average hours worked since mid-2016 . This decline is 
broad-based across type of work (full- or part-time), worker 
characteristics (age and sex), province (energy-intensive 
and non-energy-intensive) and sector (goods or services) . 
Shifts in the labour market structure, such as from full-time 
to part-time jobs or from the goods to service sector have 
contributed only  modestly to the decline in average hours

worked since mid-2016 . The drivers for these dynamics 
remain puzzling and further analysis is ongoing . 
Weaker labour market conditions in Canada relative to the 
United States are also evident in the diverging paths for 
labour compensation . Growth of unit labour costs in Canada 
has remained subdued since mid-2015 but has risen in the 
United States (Chart 4-C) . Data on wages and labour income 
tell a similar story . The discrepancy in wage pressures 
appears consistent with developments in infl ation in both 
countries . While core infl ation measures in Canada have 
drifted downward, they have increased in the United States .

All the Bank’s measures of core inflation have drifted down in recent quar-
ters. Consistent with persistent economic slack, these measures all remain 
below 2 per cent, although the range remains relatively wide—between 
1.3 and 1.9 per cent (Chart 7).3

Core of Inflation” (speech to the Department of Economics, Western University, London, Ontario,

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLICy REPORT  •  APRIL 2017

A modest recovery in potential output growth is expected 
as the effects of the oil price shock dissipate
Potential output growth is projected to increase gradually from a trough of 
1.3 per cent in 2016–17 to 1.6 per cent by 2020 (Chart 8 and the Appendix 
on page 25). Trend labour productivity growth should improve as the lagged 
effects of previously weak investment dissipate, particularly in the oil and 
gas sector. In addition, as excess capacity in the non-resource sector is 
absorbed, investment there is expected to support higher trend labour 
productivity growth. In contrast, population aging and other demographic 
forces are expected to continue to weigh on trend labour input growth.

Relative to the previous annual assessment in April 2016, the Bank’s esti-
mates for potential output growth over the projection have been revised 
down. The revision is explained by slower-than-anticipated growth in trend 
labour productivity resulting from the pronounced weakness in business 
investment over 2015 and 2016. This slower growth is only partially offset 
by a modest upward revision to trend labour input growth, reflecting higher 
levels of immigration.

The Bank’s estimate of potential output is subject to considerable uncer-
tainty and as such the estimates are presented as a range (Table 2 and the 
Appendix). In particular, the procyclical rebound in potential output growth 
incorporated into the base-case projection could be stronger than expected 
(see the Risks section on page 21).

GDP growth is expected to slow
Real GDP growth is projected to continue to slow beyond the first half of 
2017 and become more balanced across demand categories, with larger 
contributions from exports as well as public and private investment and 
smaller contributions from residential investment and consumption (Chart 8 
and Table 2).

Last observation: January 2017

From a sectoral perspective, economic growth continues to be supported 
by the expanding service sector (Chart 9). Growth in resource-related 
activity is resuming in the wake of significant adjustments to past declines 
in commodity prices, helping to support a modest expansion of the goods 
sector.

The forecast for real GDP growth in 2017 has been revised up following 
stronger-than-anticipated household expenditures, particularly residential 
investment, as well as stronger-than-expected spending activity in the oil 
and gas sector. The surprise in growth is concentrated in the first quarter. 
By the fourth quarter of 2017, the GDP growth outlook is broadly unchanged 
from that in January (Table 3). 

Exports are expected to grow at a modest pace... 
Over the projection horizon, exports are forecast to grow by a modest 
2.5 per cent, led by strengthening global demand. Ongoing challenges to 
competitiveness and uncertainty about US trade policy, however, are pro-
jected to weigh on the export outlook. As a result, export growth is particu-
larly muted relative to past cycles, leading to only a modest increase in the 
share of exports in GDP. 

Non-commodity exports are expected to expand moderately, led by 
services and several manufactured goods. Over the past year, exports of 
services, driven by transportation services and travel services, have outper-
formed goods exports, and strong growth is projected to continue. Exports 
of manufactured goods, including aircraft and related parts, and pharma-
ceutical and medicinal products, are forecast to increase. In contrast, the 
outlook also incorporates the impact of announced changes to auto produc-
tion mandates, which are expected to restrain exports in the second half of 
the year. 

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLICy REPORT  •  APRIL 2017

Canadian EConoMy  17 

Commodity exports will be supported by firmer commodity prices. Nevertheless, 
past declines in investment in the oil and gas sector and competitiveness 
challenges in the mining sector will limit their contribution to overall export 
growth. Similarly, lumber exports are being adversely affected by uncertainty 
about the size of countervailing and anti-dumping import duties levied 
by the United States and the possibility that these duties will be applied 
retroactively.

Export growth has been revised down relative to the January Report mainly 
because of additional modest drag on global investment coming from 
uncertainty about US trade policy.4

…along with business investment 
As with exports, business investment spending is expected to increase over 
the projection horizon, reflecting, in part, an end to the adjustment to the 
commodity price shock and a modest expansion in the non-resource sector. 
Nevertheless, it is projected to remain well below what would normally be 
expected based on previous business cycles. Overall, business investment’s 
share of total demand in the Canadian economy is expected to remain close 
to its current level over the forecast horizon (Chart 10).

Responses to the spring 2017 Business Outlook Survey indicate that, after 
two years of weakness, plans to invest in machinery and equipment have 
become more widespread. However, many participating firms expect the 
increase in expenditures to be modest and, in some cases, limited to main-
tenance. This suggests that the economic upturn is not yet perceived to be 
sufficiently certain or sustainable to warrant major investment expenditures.

Canadian firms remain wary, in part, because of concerns about increased 
protectionism, reduced competitiveness of Canadian firms in the event of 
corporate tax cuts and regulatory changes in the United States, and pos-
sible delays in the implementation of other US policies. While several sur-
veys suggest that indicators of business sentiment have improved recently, 
many are still below their historical averages (Chart 11).

Investment in industries outside the oil and gas sector is expected to remain 
subdued in 2017. In fact, capital expenditures in the manufacturing sector 
are expected to be weak, as shown in Statistics Canada’s survey of the cap-
ital spending intentions of firms. Nevertheless, rates of capacity utilization 
for many of these industries are close to their historical highs. Following the 
projected expansion of demand, more firms will face capacity constraints, 
and investment is anticipated to rise.

After contracting for two years, investment in the oil and gas sector is 
projected to expand moderately, as indicated by increased rig activity and 
reported capital expenditure plans (Chart 12). This outlook is supported by 
the spring Business Outlook Survey, which finds that the investment inten-
tions of firms in regions most affected by the oil price shock have improved 
but are still low, revealing a sense of cautious optimism. Nevertheless, pros-
pects for the sector are highly contingent on the outlook for global oil prices 
and the completion of pipeline projects.

Investment growth has been revised down from the January Report, since 
the uncertainty about US trade policy is now projected to persist for longer 
than previously assumed.5 

Household spending is expected to moderate 
Growth in consumer spending should remain solid in 2017, supported by 
steady gains in labour income as well as elevated housing and financial 
wealth. Looking ahead, consumption growth is expected to moderate 
broadly in line with growth in disposable income. Elevated debt will also 
restrain expenditures somewhat. The overall ratio of debt to disposable 
income is expected to edge higher. 

Housing market activity has been very strong in some segments of the 
national market. In particular, resales and starts have increased significantly 
in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and in parts of the Golden Horseshoe 
region. Price growth in the GTA has accelerated and seems to have entered 
a phase in which speculation is playing a larger role. Resales have also 
increased in Alberta, albeit from previous lows. Conversely, resales have 
slowed in the Greater Vancouver Area, and growth remains modest in the 
rest of the country. 

The projected moderation in household spending will be led by a slower 
pace of growth in housing expenditures. As in the January Report, the 
Bank expects changes to the federal government’s housing finance policy 
to continue to dampen housing activity. In addition, the housing market is 
anticipated to slow somewhat in light of elevated household debt and higher 
longer-term borrowing costs resulting from the projected gradual rise in 
global long-term yields. 

5  This additional effect has led to a projected reduction in investment growth of about 0.5 percentage 

points in both 2017 and 2018.

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLICy REPORT  •  APRIL 2017

In light of stronger-than-expected data in most markets in the first quarter of 
2017, the contribution of residential investment to real GDP growth in 2017 
is expected to be significantly higher than anticipated in January. This is the 
primary reason behind the upward revision to GDP growth in 2017.

CPI inflation is expected to remain close to 2 per cent 
CPI inflation is expected to dip to 1.7 per cent in the middle of 2017 as the 
upward pressure from consumer energy prices dissipates. In addition, 
weak food prices, electricity rebates and excess supply weigh on inflation 
(Chart 13).

Starting in the second half of 2017, inflation is projected to fluctuate narrowly 
around 2 per cent as the impact of the relative price shocks fade at differing 
speeds. As excess capacity is absorbed in the first half of 2018, inflation 
returns sustainably to the 2 per cent target.6 

Medium- and long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. The 
March 2017 Consensus Economics forecast for CPI inflation is 2.1 per cent 
in 2017 and 2.0 per cent in 2018.

Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, a reasonable range 
around the base-case projection for CPI inflation is ±0.3 percentage points. 
This range is intended to convey a sense of forecast uncertainty.

6  By convention, the Bank assumes a constant exchange rate over the forecast horizon. Consequently, 

there is no effect from changes in the exchange rate on inflation once the effects of past move-
ments have dissipated. The effect of commodity prices on inflation is positive but very small over 
2018 and 2019 since oil prices are assumed to remain near their recent average levels throughout the 
projection, while some non-energy commodity prices increase modestly.

Risks to the inflation outlook

The prospect of a notable shift toward protectionist global trade policies is the 
most important source of uncertainty surrounding the outlook. However, it is 
impossible to fully quantify the implications of this shift without more clarity 
about the actual measures and their timing. The range of possibilities is wide, 
and the channels through which the measures would affect the economy 
are complex (Box 1 on page 2). Nevertheless, the Bank has attempted to 
better balance the risks around the outlook by incorporating at least some of 
the adverse impact of the elevated uncertainty on business investment and 
exports into the base case. 

Aside from this, the Bank’s outlook is subject to several risks emanating 
from both the external environment and the domestic economy. As in past 
reports, the focus is on a selection of risks identified as the most important 
for the projected path for inflation, drawing from a larger set of risks taken 
into account in the projection. The evolution of the risks since the previous 
Report is summarized in Table 4. The risk of higher potential output has 
been added, while the risks of higher global long-term interest rates and 
higher commodity prices are not highlighted in this Report but will continue 
to be monitored. 

(i)  Stronger real GDP growth in the United States 

While the base case incorporates some strengthening in US economic 
growth, resulting in part from anticipated fiscal stimulus, an even 
stronger growth path is also possible. The ongoing recovery, together 
with prospective policy changes, such as infrastructure spending and 
deregulation, could trigger “animal spirits,” especially if global policy 
uncertainty dissipates—that is, they could boost business confidence 
and lead to an acceleration in the rate of investment, firm creation and 
innovation. Stronger US household spending and public and private 
investment would have positive spillovers for Canadian business con-
fidence, investment and exports.   

(ii)  Sluggish business investment in Canada

While the outlook for business investment already reflects some of the 
adverse impact coming from elevated US policy uncertainty, further 
downside risks remain. In particular, the disappointing performance 
of business investment since the global financial crisis could signal 
that demographic forces or some other structural factors are more 
relevant than previously estimated. In addition, the ongoing shift in 
the economy’s production toward less-capital-intensive services 
could result in both a different composition and a smaller share of 

 

 

22  Risks to thE inflation outlook

investment in GDP. Over time, weaker business investment would 
also reduce capital deepening and lower potential output, partially 
mitigating the disinflationary effect of weaker demand.

(iii)  Stronger household spending and rising household debt in 

Canada 
Strong motor vehicle sales, high consumer confidence, elevated 
single-family home construction, increased house resales and 
rising house prices suggest that underlying household spending 
growth remains robust. While the Bank expects growth in household 
spending to moderate in the coming quarters, strength could continue 
for some time if the savings rate (now at its highest level since 2001) 
declines by more than expected or if the current momentum in the 
housing market persists. While this would provide a near-term boost 
to economic activity, it could further exacerbate the macroeconomic 
and financial vulnerabilities associated with high household indebted-
ness and house prices. 

(iv)  Higher potential output in Canada 

Uncertainty associated with the Bank’s estimate of potential output is 
large. The current level of potential output could be higher than esti-
mated, resulting in more excess supply and less inflationary pressure 
than currently assessed. 

Furthermore, the trajectory of potential output could be higher than 
anticipated, posing a downside risk to inflation. As the economy 
gains strength and approaches full capacity, greater investment, 
including through new firm creation, could generate a faster expan-
sion of potential output than assumed in the base case. Moreover, 
this stronger activity could lead to reabsorption of workers, especially 
youth, who have left the labour force or were unemployed or under-
employed for a long time.7 The procyclical effects of this additional 
firm and employment creation could provide a boost to potential 
output growth. The stronger these effects are, the more likely it is for 
potential output growth to be in the upper part of the Bank’s range of 
estimates and for inflation to fall short of the projection.

appendix: Reassessment of 
Potential output Growth

This appendix explains the results of the Bank’s annual 
reassessment of the outlook for potential output 
growth.8 Potential output growth is projected to pick 
up from 1.3 per cent in 2017 to 1.6 per cent by 2020 
(Table A-1). It can be divided into two components: 
trend labour input (trend number of hours worked) and 
trend labour productivity (trend output per hour worked).

Trend labour input growth will continue to slow gradually 
over the projection horizon, largely reflecting demo-
graphic forces (Chart A-1). Growth in the working-age 
population is anticipated to decline as the population 
ages, despite a partial offset from strong immigration. 
In addition, the employment rate and average hours 
worked are expected to continue to trend downward. 
Although today’s older workers have higher labour 
market participation rates than previous cohorts, they 
are still less likely to be employed than prime-age 
workers (those aged 25 to 54) and, when they are 
employed, are likely to work fewer hours. In addition, the 
composition of employed workers is shifting toward the 
service sector, where the number of hours worked per 
week tends to be lower. 

Slow trend labour productivity growth weighs on poten-
tial output growth in the near term, reflecting both the 
lagged effects of the declines in investment, especially 
in the oil and gas sector (Chart A-1), and the displace-
ment of energy sector workers following the decline in 
oil prices. Trend labour productivity growth is projected 
to return to its historical average of around 1.2 per cent 
just beyond 2020, as investment gradually improves. 
In particular, investment in machinery and equipment, 
which is associated with stronger productivity growth, 
is expected to pick up.

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLICy REPORT  •  APRIL 2017

 

Over the near term, potential output growth is assumed 
to be slightly weaker than expected in the Bank’s 
previous reassessment in April 2016 and reverts to a 
similar growth rate by 2020. The downward revision is 
explained by slower-than-anticipated trend labour pro-
ductivity growth resulting from the unanticipated weak-
ness in business investment. This effect is, however, 
partially offset by a small upward revision to trend labour 
input growth, reflecting stronger immigration.9 

The neutral nominal policy rate in Canada is estimated 
to be 3 per cent (in a range of 2.5 to 3.5 per cent). The 
estimate is 25 basis points lower than assumed in 
April 2016 because of global factors and the downward 
revision to the projection of potential output growth in 
Canada.

Estimates of potential output are imprecise because 
of uncertainty about its components, for example, 
how productivity will evolve, which in turn depends on 
technological advances and various structural changes. 
Productivity also depends on the level and composition 
of future investment, which are difficult to predict. The 
range of estimates for potential output growth helps to 
account for this uncertainty (Table A-1).10

9  The target for admission of immigrants has been increased from a range 
of 260,000 to 285,000 in 2015 to 300,000 per year for 2016 and beyond. 
In addition, an express entry system was introduced in January 2015, and 
subsequently widened, to speed up the processing of applications for 
permanent residency through different programs. And on 9 March 2017, 
the federal government announced a new initiative to help high-growth 
Canadian companies attract specialized global talent by providing more 
predictable, streamlined reviews and approvals for work permits.

10  Estimates of potential output growth become more uncertain over the 

projection horizon (Table 2 on page 10). By the end of 2019, this zone of 
uncertainty implies that the level of potential output could be as much as 
1 per cent higher or lower than in the base case.

Overall, it is more likely at this stage in the business 
cycle that potential output growth would be in the upper 
part of the range. Expanded capacity and stronger 
activity, for example, could further reduce long-term 
unemployment and underemployment in the labour 
market. The procyclical effects of increased investment 
and employment creation could provide an additional 
small boost to potential output growth relative to the 
base case. However, the size and timing of these effects 
are highly uncertain. 

Another upside risk could arise from the Canada–
European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade 
Agreement or additional trade agreements in the future. 
A reduction in interprovincial trade barriers in line with 
the recent announcement by federal and provincial 
governments could also boost potential output. For 
example, lowering interprovincial trade costs would 
affect productivity growth for key sectors that account 
for a large share of internal trade.

Potential output growth could be weaker than projected 
if the shift toward protectionist global trade policies 
materializes. Trade facilitates specialization and innova-
tion. Canadian companies that trade internationally tend 
to be the most productive. Measures that would restrict 
international trade would reduce productivity-enhancing 
investment and growth in trend labour productivity.

Inﬂ ation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote 

the economic and fi nancial well-being of Canadians.

pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s 
outlook, including risks to the projection, are published four 
times per year in the Monetary Policy Report.

  Canada’s experience with infl ation targeting since 1991 has 

shown that the best way to foster confi dence in the value 
of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth, 
employment gains and improved living standards is by keeping 
infl ation low, stable and predictable.

Inﬂ ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible
  Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which 

means that the Bank is equally concerned about infl ation rising 
above or falling below the 2 percent target.

  In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 

Canada’s infl ation-control target for a further fi ve-year period, 
ending December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the 
consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 percent midpoint 
of the control range of 1 to 3 percent.

  Canada’s infl ation-targeting framework is fl exible. Typically, 

the Bank seeks to return infl ation to target over a horizon of six 
to eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for 
returning infl ation to target will vary depending on the nature 
and persistence of the shocks buffeting the economy.

The monetary policy instrument
  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes in the 

target for the overnight rate of interest.2 These changes are 
transmitted to the economy through their infl uence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate, 
which affect total demand for Canadian goods and services. 
The balance between this demand and the economy’s 
production capacity is, over time, the primary determinant of 
infl ation pressures in the economy.

  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight 
quarters—to work their way through the economy and have 
their full effect on infl ation. For this reason, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent 

communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspective on 
the forces at work on the economy and their implications for 
infl ation. The Monetary Policy Report is a key element of this 
approach. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight 

Monitoring inﬂ ation
  In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in 
indirect taxes such as GST, can cause sizable fl uctuations in 
CPI.

  In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through 

such transitory movements in CPI infl ation and focuses 
on a set of “core” infl ation measures that better refl ect the 
underlying trend of infl ation. In this sense, these measures 
act as an operational guide to help the Bank achieve the CPI 
infl ation target. They are not a replacement for CPI infl ation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl ation are CPI-
trim, which excludes CPI components whose rates of change 
in a given month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which 
corresponds to the price change located at the 50th percentile 
(in terms of basket weight) of the distribution of price changes; 
and CPI-common, which uses a statistical procedure to track 
common price changes across categories in the CPI basket.

Infl ation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide additional  monetary 

stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website, 
describes these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Overview
Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a worldwide health-care emergency 
as well as an economic calamity. Both are on a scale few have seen in 
their lifetime. The virus has spread broadly and rapidly, and to contain it, 
governments introduced public health measures that curtailed economic 
activity. The virus, combined with these necessary measures, has brought 
about the steepest and deepest economic decline since the Great 
Depression. Virtually every aspect of the Canadian and global economies 
has been affected, causing widespread losses in jobs and business 
incomes.

The course of the pandemic is inherently unknowable, and its evolution 
over time and across regions remains highly uncertain. New cases of 
the virus are now at very low levels in China, but many other emerging-
market economies (EMEs) are now seeing their number of new cases 
increase rapidly (Chart 1). Some advanced economies that were hard-hit 
at the outset have slowed the rise in new cases and are reopening their 
economies. In the United States, infections have reached new highs. 
Globally, hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost.

Time

In Canada, the number of new COVID-19 cases has fallen sharply from 
its April high, and the economic recovery has begun in all provinces and 
territories and across many sectors. Consequently, economic activity is 
picking up notably as measures to contain the virus are relaxed. This is a 
welcome sign.

The Bank of Canada expects a sharp rebound in economic activity in the 
reopening phase of the recovery, followed by a more prolonged recuperation 
phase, which will be uneven across regions and sectors (Figure 1). As a 
result, Canada’s economic output will likely take some time to return to its 
pre-COVID-19 level. Many workers and businesses can expect to face an 
extended period of difficulty.

A central scenario is provided rather than a projection
The economic outlook is extremely uncertain, largely because of the 
unpredictable course of the virus. Reflecting this, the July Monetary Policy 
Report provides a central scenario for the economy rather than the usual 
economic projection.

The central scenario is informed by the Bank’s analysis and tries to balance 
the likelihood of better and worse scenarios, but it is highly conditional on 
our assumptions about the virus. In particular, the central scenario assumes 
the following:

  there will not be a broad-based second wave of the pandemic in Canada 

or globally;

  most large-scale containment measures will be gradually lifted; and

  the pandemic will have largely run its course by mid-2022, likely because 

of the widespread availability of a vaccine or effective treatment.

In addition to the fundamental uncertainty about the course of the virus, 
there is also considerable uncertainty about its impacts. In particular, there 
is not enough information to estimate how deeply the economy may be 
scarred from business closures or massive job losses. Further, once supply 
is restored, it is unclear how quickly demand will recover because people 
may have changed their priorities, work patterns and social behaviours as a 
result of the pandemic.

The Bank departed from the usual structure for the Monetary Policy Report 
in April by not including a base-case projection. For this July Report, 
the Bank moves in the direction of the traditional format by providing a 
central scenario, but given the unusual level of uncertainty, the information 
provided is somewhat less precise. For example, Table 1 and Table 2 in this 
Report are based on the Bank’s central scenario. Less detail is provided 
on the breakdown of the projection for global economic growth and on 
the compositional contributions to the growth of Canada’s gross domestic 
product (GDP).

After a historic plunge in the first half of the year, global economic activity 
is beginning to pick up. The increase in global demand has contributed to 
a partial rebound in the prices of commodities and some financial assets. 
The decisive actions taken by many governments and central banks have 
put households and businesses in a position to resume spending and 
production as containment measures are relaxed. But there is significant 
ground to make up, and regional flare-ups of the virus could impede the 
recovery.

In the Bank’s central scenario, global output rebounds in the second half of 
this year, although the timing and strength of the recovery vary considerably 
from one region to another. The effects of both ongoing physical distancing 
and elevated uncertainty are assumed to continue to restrain economic 
activity over the scenario’s time horizon. Global output falls by about 
5 percent in 2020 and then grows by around 5 percent on average in 
2021 and 2022 (Table 1). Despite this strong rebound, global output at 
the end of 2022 remains about 4 percent below the projected level in the 
January Report.

Uncertainty around this scenario is considerable. There are a multitude of 
scenarios both stronger and weaker than the central one presented here. 
Yet overall, the risks appear to be tilted to the downside, largely because of 
the potential for a second wave of the virus.

The global economic contraction was sharp and sudden
Measures to control the spread of COVID-19 forced many businesses to 
reduce or halt their operations, resulting in unprecedented job losses. 
Global supply chains were disrupted, and global trade fell sharply. The 
containment measures affected mainly labour-intensive activity, resulting 
in a sharper decline in services than in manufacturing. In addition, the 
pandemic and containment measures were accompanied by an abrupt 
deterioration in business and household confidence and significant changes 
in behaviour. The Bank estimates that the level of global GDP in the second 
quarter was about 10 percent below its level in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Inflation also fell in all major economies (Chart 2). Prices of gasoline 
dropped sharply in March and April before partially rebounding in May. The 
plunge in energy prices reflected the rapid and large fall in global demand. 
Lower prices for transportation services and at hotels and restaurants also 
contributed to weak inflation in most regions. In contrast, food prices rose 
at a faster pace than usual. Overall, the inflationary pressures from supply 
disruptions were outweighed by the effects of the fall in demand.

Growth is picking up as economies reopen
China was the first major country to allow some businesses to restart their 
operations, with strict infection prevention and control measures in place 
to rein in any new outbreaks. China’s industrial production has rebounded 
strongly, returning to pre-lockdown levels (Chart 3). Demand indicators 
such as retail sales, however, have risen less than production as consumers 
remain cautious. As well, manufacturing investment is sluggish, suggesting 
that businesses are still uncertain about the strength of future demand, 
given the pandemic and ongoing trade tensions with the United States.

Economic conditions vary considerably across other EMEs. Some East 
Asian countries have managed to keep the number of COVID-19 cases low 
and their economies mostly open. Some emerging European countries that 
had put lockdowns in place have recently allowed businesses to reopen. 
Meanwhile, many Latin American and African EMEs are still experiencing 
the first wave of the pandemic, at great human cost. These countries are 
struggling to contain the virus, which may prolong the negative economic 
effects and delay their recoveries. This, coupled with high levels of debt, is 
raising financial stability concerns in some EMEs.

In many advanced economies, activity picked up in May and June. Surveys 
indicated an increase in activity and confidence in the euro area. Production, 
employment and household spending also increased in the United States, 
but the resurgence in new COVID-19 cases since the middle of June is 
slowing the rebound as many states are scaling back their reopening plans.

Demand is expected to remain weak relative to supply
In the second half of this year, the pace of global growth rebounds strongly 
in the central scenario. The recovery then slows in 2021 and 2022, but 
growth is still relatively strong. In the central scenario, the level of economic 
activity reaches its pre-COVID-19 level around the end of 2021. While the 
impact of the pandemic is negative for both supply and demand, the effects 
on demand are larger.

On the supply side, production practices in some sectors will need to 
adjust to include physical distancing measures. As companies evaluate the 
vulnerability of cross-border trade, supply chains could become shorter, 
more local and possibly more diversified after the pandemic. On the 
demand side, even when lockdown restrictions relax fully, precautionary 
physical distancing will likely continue to restrain household spending. In 
addition, elevated indebtedness and economic uncertainty are expected to 
cause some businesses to scale back or cancel large investment projects.

Policy actions continue to provide support
Authorities in many countries were able to quickly implement extraordinary 
measures to support household incomes and limit the economic damage 
related to the shutdown. These actions will support the recovery as activity 
resumes.

Governments in advanced economies and some large EMEs, such as China 
and Brazil, have significantly increased resources to fight the pandemic and 
soften its economic blow. These resources include transfers to households 
and businesses to replace a portion of their lost income. Many countries 
have also implemented loan guarantees and direct funding programs to help 
businesses facing liquidity shortages. Authorities in some of these countries 
are considering additional fiscal support. In many other EMEs, fiscal support 
has generally been more modest due to already elevated debt levels.

Central banks around the world have taken decisive measures to stabilize 
the financial system and support credit flows to businesses and households. 
These include measures to ease short-term funding strains and to improve 
liquidity. Major central banks have reduced their policy rates or eased 
through other measures. In the United States, the US Federal Reserve 
lowered the federal funds rate, significantly increased its purchase of US 
Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities and introduced a series of other 
programs to support the flow of credit. In addition, it extended its network 
of US-dollar swap arrangements in response to the increased stress in the 
offshore US dollar market.

Global financial conditions have improved substantially since the April 
Report, and this is helping support the recovery. Markets have reacted 
positively to the fiscal and monetary measures, the pickup in global demand 
and signs of receding negative tail risks. Since the April Report, equity 
prices have recovered a significant portion of their losses, credit spreads 
have narrowed, and volatility has declined across all markets (Chart 4). 
Financial market indicators for EMEs have also generally improved, although 
by less in hard-hit economies such as Brazil, South Africa and Mexico, 
where the pandemic is still spreading rapidly.

Last observation: July 10, 2020

The US dollar has depreciated somewhat against major currencies 
since April, including the Canadian dollar. Safe-haven flows into assets 
denominated in US dollars declined, and some flows reverted to assets 
denominated in other currencies. The increase in commodity prices has 
also supported the Canadian dollar. Government bond yields in advanced 
economies remain close to their historical lows due to central bank asset 
purchases and financial market expectations that central banks will keep 
their policy rates low for an extended period.

Commodity prices have partially rebounded
Global oil prices have increased since the April Report but remain about 
30 percent below pre-pandemic levels. The recent rise reflects both an 
increase in global oil consumption as economies reopen and reduced 
production (Chart 5). Low oil prices led members of the Organization of 
the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some other non-OPEC oil 
producers to agree to reduce output by 9.7 million barrels per day compared 
with their October 2018 levels.1 North American producers also cut output 
by about 4 million barrels per day.

In its central scenario, the Bank assumes that the prices of Brent and West 
Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil will remain close to their recent average levels, 
about US$40 per barrel. Risks around this assumption are tilted to the 
upside over the medium term because prices could continue to increase as 
global growth recovers and oil consumption picks up.

1  This corresponds roughly to a production cut of 8 million barrels per day relative to their March 2020 

levels.

The price of Western Canadian Select (WCS) has also risen and was 
recently hovering around US$30 per barrel. The spread between the prices 
of WTI and WCS has narrowed to about US$10, due in part to the cuts in 
Canadian output. Moreover, the decline in demand was more pronounced 
for light oil such as WTI, which is used more in jet fuel and gasoline, than for 
heavy oils such as WCS.

The Bank’s non-energy commodity price index has recovered its decline 
from February to April. The rise in the price of base metals is consistent 
with the gradual recovery in industrial production and the increases in 
infrastructure spending in China and some advanced economies. Prices for 
lumber have risen, reflecting the closures of sawmills due to COVID-19.

The Canadian economy is starting to recover from the tragic and 
devastating effects of the pandemic. The human and economic costs would 
be considerably worse if the containment measures had not succeeded in 
flattening the curve. In the second quarter, when containment measures 
were at their most restrictive, economic activity is estimated to have fallen 
about 15 percent below its level at the end of 2019. The economy appears to 
have hit bottom in April, with about 3 million jobs lost.

The economic contraction and subsequent recovery will look very different 
from those of a typical business cycle. The impact of the containment 
measures varied substantially across industries and types of jobs. Some 
jobs continued with little disruption because of the availability of online 
tools and the ability to work remotely. Others were hit very hard, particularly 
within the service sector, including jobs in travel, hospitality and personal 
care services. In addition, the burden has been falling disproportionately on 
some segments of the workforce, including lower-income earners, younger 
workers, recent immigrants and women (Chart 6).

Box 1

Key inputs to the central scenario 
The Bank’s central scenario is conditional on several key 
assumptions that aﬀ ect the outlook for the Canadian 
economy . In addition to the assumptions about the 
progression of the pandemic and public health measures 
described in the Overview section, the key inputs into the 
Bank’s central scenario are as follows:  
•  Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent levels . 
The per-barrel prices in US dollars are assumed to be 
$40 for Brent and West Texas Intermediate and $30 for 
Western Canadian Select . 

•  By convention, the Bank does not forecast the exchange 
rate in the Monetary Policy Report . In the central scenario, 
the Canadian dollar is assumed to remain close to recent 
levels, at about 74 cents US . 

•  The neutral nominal policy rate is deﬁ ned as the real 
rate consistent with output remaining sustainably at 
its potential and with infl ation at target, on an ongoing 
basis, plus 2 percent for infl ation . It is a medium- to long-
term equilibrium concept . The central scenario assumes 
the neutral rate is 2 .5 percent, in the lower half of the 
previously estimated range . The neutral rate will be 
reassessed more fully in the October Report . 

•  The pandemic and the related containment measures 
are signiﬁ cantly aﬀ ecting both supply and demand in 
the Canadian economy . In the central scenario, the Bank 
assumes that the impact on supply in the ﬁ rst half of 
2020 is roughly 60 percent of the size of the impact on 
GDP . The level of output is estimated to have fallen to 
about 15 percent below its level in the fourth quarter 
of 2019 . This would imply a gap between demand and 
supply of roughly 6 to 7 percent in the second quarter . 

•  The degree of uncertainty around these estimates is 

unusually high due to the extraordinary nature and 
size of the ec onomic shocks caused by COVID-19 . 
For additional details about the Bank’s assumptions 
for supply and potential output in the central scenario, 
see Box 3 on page 24 . The Bank will provide a more 
detailed analysis of its long-run assumptions in the 
October Report .

The strong, well-targeted and complementary fiscal and monetary policy 
actions provide a solid foundation for the recovery. Still, as reopening 
progresses, many people will probably continue to fear contracting the 
virus, and uncertainty about job security is likely to persist. Both consumer 
and business confidence are therefore expected to remain subdued, 
restraining spending and employment, particularly in activities that involve 
in-person interaction. In addition, the pandemic has led to changes in 
preferences and behaviours. Some of these shifts are expected to endure, 
with lasting effects that could lead to structural changes in the economy 
over the longer term.

Despite the significant hardships that Canadians continue to face, the 
economy has so far avoided the most severe scenarios presented in the 
April Report. There are already signs that the reopening of businesses 
will lead to an initial strong bounce back in economic growth (Table 2). 
However, this is expected to give way to a recuperation phase during which 
the pace of the recovery will moderate as the pandemic continues to affect 
confidence and the economy undergoes widespread adjustments, including 
in the energy sector. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation is expected to 
remain weak before gradually strengthening toward the 2 percent target, as 
the drag from low gasoline prices and other temporary effects dissipate and 
demand recovers, reducing economic slack (Box 1).

Fiscal and monetary authorities responded swiftly
The labour market impact of the containment measures has been severe. 
Between February and April, some 3 million people were suddenly out of 
work. In May, the unemployment rate reached a peak of 13.7 percent. An 
additional 1.4 million people reported that they wanted to work but did 
not look for a job, suggesting an adjusted unemployment rate of nearly 
20 percent. Broader measures of underemployment, which include people 
who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours, suggest 
that roughly one-third of the labour force was underutilized.

The federal government quickly launched unprecedented fiscal policy 
actions to help households and businesses during the lockdown. Policies 
were introduced to replace lost income and encourage businesses to retain 
workers.2 The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and other 
transfers have offset lost employment income for many workers. In addition, 
the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) has helped businesses 
maintain relationships with their workers and should reduce longer-term 
scarring effects of unemployment on the economy. Nearly one-quarter of 
the respondents to the Bank’s summer Business Outlook Survey reported 
that this subsidy had enabled them to either avoid or reduce the scale of 
potential layoffs.

Businesses also have access to loans through federal programs. The 
Canada Emergency Business Account in particular has been widely used. 
It provides up to $40,000 in funding to existing small businesses and will 
forgive up to $10,000 if the loan is repaid before the end of 2022.

In addition, federal, provincial and territorial governments have granted 
deferrals on more than $123 billion in taxes, fees and customs duties. 
While temporary, these measures have been an important source of relief 
for many businesses and households facing cash-flow pressures. As 
well, commercial lenders implemented processes for households to defer 
mortgage and other debt payments.

The Bank also responded swiftly to the effects of the pandemic. Starting 
in late February, uncertainty about how bad things could get and how long 
the downturn might last prompted a widespread flight to cash and made it 
difficult for investors to sell assets. In response to the seizing up in financial 
markets and the economic contraction, the Bank rapidly reduced the policy 
interest rate to its effective lower bound of 0.25 percent and introduced 
a range of liquidity facilities and asset purchase programs to help ease

problems with market functioning. These programs include purchases 
of Canada Mortgage Bonds, bankers’ acceptances, commercial paper, 
corporate bonds and provincial and federal government debt.

Financial markets are now functioning considerably better and, 
consequently, the use of some facilities has declined (Chart 7). The Bank’s 
large-scale asset purchases of Government of Canada bonds initially 
improved liquidity and confidence. Now, with market functioning improved 
and the economy reopening, these purchases are providing considerable 
monetary stimulus. The lowering of the policy interest rate to its effective 
lower bound, the bond purchases and the easing of global financial 
conditions have all contributed to lower domestic interest rates and made 
it easier for households and businesses to borrow. For example, the lower 
yields on five-year Government of Canada bonds are being reflected in 
cheaper fixed-rate mortgages. These actions have reduced debt-service 
costs and will contribute to spending that should support the recovery.

The reopening phase of the recovery is underway
GDP is estimated to have contracted sharply in the second quarter (Table 2 
and Chart 8). Timely high-frequency data suggest that the economic fallout 
was at its worst in April. In May and June, as the number of new COVID-19 
cases stabilized and began to decrease, governments started easing the 
containment restrictions. Labour market indicators suggest that economic 
activity began expanding in May and accelerated in June. About 1 11/44 million 
jobs were added in these two months, with broad-based, but uneven, 
increases across sectors (Chart 9).

The effects of containment measures differ across businesses, and public 
health protocols vary across provinces, territories and municipalities. 
Together, these mean that the process of reopening will be gradual and 
uneven. Some activities, including motor vehicle sales, have already seen 
a strong pickup since April. Likewise, housing activity fell sharply during 
the lockdown but is beginning to recover quickly. In contrast, some of 
the hardest-hit businesses, such as restaurants, travel and personal care 
services, have only just started to see improvements in recent weeks and 
are expected to continue to face significant challenges.

These developments are consistent with measures of consumer and 
business confidence, which have improved but remain subdued (Chart 10). 
Despite the programs that have been introduced, some households and 
businesses are suffering severe financial hardship.

In the central scenario, about 40 percent of the drop in output in the first 
half of 2020 is reversed in the third quarter. This reflects the lifting of most 
containment measures and some associated improvement in confidence. 
The strength of growth in the third quarter is largely driven by the initial 
boost from the reopening of businesses and the resulting partial rebound 
in spending. The pace of growth is therefore unlikely to persist. Overall, the 
economy has thus far avoided the most severe scenarios presented in the 
April Report, but considerable economic slack remains.

CPI inflation has fallen sharply
Demand for some goods and services has fallen sharply because of the 
pandemic and related containment measures, triggering sharp declines 
in prices for gasoline, travel services, and clothing and footwear. In the 
calculation of inflation, these price declines have heavily outweighed 
the increase in prices for products that saw a surge in demand, such as 
household cleaning supplies and non-perishable food, or that suffered from 
supply disruptions, such as meat (Chart 11).

The direct and indirect effects of the crisis have been pulling down CPI 
inflation. As anticipated in the April Report, CPI inflation fell close to zero in 
April and May. The Bank’s measures of core inflation have also declined, 
although by far less because they tend to filter out more volatile price 
movements such as those for gasoline. Core inflation measures ranged from 
1.4 to 1.9 percent (Chart 12).

The consumption patterns of Canadians have changed dramatically since 
the start of the pandemic. CPI inflation is calculated using fixed pre-
pandemic consumption weights and thus may not accurately capture the 
inflation rate households are currently facing. Box 2 outlines a new adjusted 
price index that captures the effects of the change in consumption patterns. 
The new price index is based on recent monthly transaction and survey 
data. It also shows a sizable decline in inflation, albeit one that is slightly 
smaller than in the official CPI (Chart 12).3

Data Reveal About Spending and Inflation During COVID-19?” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note

show that although consumption patterns shifted through 
the containment period (and by quite a bit in areas such as 
travel services), shifts in the weights did not have a large 
impact on overall infl ation .5 Thus, both the adjusted index and 
the CPI indicate that the impacts of COVID-19 containment 
measures and behavioural changes have been strongly 
disinfl ationary .
Statistics Canada and the Bank will c ontinue to update this 
new index to calculate an adjusted CPI infl ation measure 
through the recovery period . The diﬀ erence between the 
two measures of infl ation may dissipate if the changes in 
consumption patterns reverse . 

Table 2-A: CPI component weights based on

Adjusted CPI infl ation shows only slightly less decline than CPI infl ation
Abrupt, large shifts in consumer spending occurred with 
the onset of the pandemic . These shifts imply that the 
consumer price index (CPI), which is a ﬁ xed basket of 
goods and services, may not refl ect the actual level of 
infl ation Canadians experienced during the containment 
period . The responses to the Bank of Canada’s most recent 
Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations illustrate this 
potential discrepancy . Respondents indicated that, in their 
experience, year-over-year infl ation had remained close 
to 2 percent in the second quarter of 2020 . However, in 
fact, infl ation as measured by the CPI is estimated to have 
declined sharply .1
To better understand consumers’ current infl ation 
experiences, the Bank and Statistics Canada developed 
an adjusted price index, also referred to as the Analytical 
price index . This index updates weights based on high-
frequency expenditure data, adjusting them to shifts in 
consumption patterns .2 New monthly weights are calculated 
using anonymized aggregated payment data, Statistics 
Canada’s monthly retail trade survey, and transaction data 
from Canadian grocery retailers as well as subject matter 
expertise .3
The new index shows how much consumption patterns 
have changed . For instance, the adjusted weights for food, 
medicine and other pharmaceutical products (health and 
personal care) are higher than in the CPI . In contrast, the 
weights for transportation (travel, motor vehicles), clothing 
and recreation are signiﬁ cantly lower than CPI weights 
(Table 2-A) .
Overall, this adjusted index suggests slightly less 
downward pressure on infl ation than CPI does, by about 
0 .3 percentage points in May (Chart 12) .4 These results

patterns, and thus  monthly growth rates, are the same as those measured by CPI . 

because they are more likely to be infl uenced by items purchased frequently,

Firms have been heavily discounting some products to clear out undesired 
inventories that built up at the height of the pandemic. At the same time, 
there is only limited evidence to date of firms marking up their prices to 
cover the increased costs of doing business during the pandemic. Despite 
these additional costs, respondents to the summer Business Outlook 
Survey stated that they intend to raise prices less than last year and operate 
with smaller margins to remain competitive. Combined with low energy 
prices, these forces are expected to keep inflation weak in the near term.

Growth moderates in the recuperation phase
After the initial bounce back in GDP growth, the economy is expected 
to enter a more protracted and gradual recovery (Chart 13). This reflects 
persistent effects of ongoing physical distancing measures, a slow rebound 
in foreign demand and subdued confidence on the part of households and 
firms resulting from elevated uncertainty about both the pandemic and the 
pace of the recovery.

Ongoing restructuring is an additional factor that restrains activity during 
recuperation. Some businesses will not reopen, others will go bankrupt, 
and new firms will require more time to form and scale. The service 
sector is usually more resilient in recessions, providing a buffering role 
for the economy. This time, however, the sector was also hit hard during 
containment and will face ongoing challenges adjusting to a world where 
physical distancing remains necessary.

In the central scenario, fiscal and monetary policies together provide 
substantial support to the Canadian economy. Fiscal measures are 
scaled to the impacts of the pandemic and respond to evolving economic 
conditions. Since the April Report, the CERB and CEWS have both been 
extended. Moreover, other programs have been introduced or expanded, 
including commercial rent assistance and additional supports for students 
and new graduates, seniors, essential workers, and the oil and gas sector.4 
Monetary stimulus has reduced borrowing costs for both households and 
businesses.

Several forces contribute to closing the gap between supply and demand 
over time in the central scenario. Supply initially recovers in line with the 
easing of containment measures. Demand benefits only gradually from 
improvements in foreign demand and confidence as well as support from 
fiscal and monetary policies, but eventually foreign and domestic demand 
increase faster than supply, absorbing excess capacity.

Household spending will rise, but caution may linger
In the central scenario, household spending picks up gradually as 
containment measures are eventually lifted and confidence in the economy 
improves. However, caution persists. Thus, while the savings rate declines 
from its peak in the second quarter, it remains higher than in recent years 
(Chart 14).5

5  The large jump in the savings rate in the second quarter reflects the combined impact of the income

spending due to the containment measures. The effects on disposable income are expected to unwind 
in the third quarter.

Underlying the central scenario, the consumption patterns of households 
differ greatly depending on households’ individual financial situations and 
the impact of the pandemic on their incomes.6 Lower-income workers have 
been disproportionately affected by the efforts to contain the spread of the 
virus, either through layoffs or reduced hours. Many have seen their lost 
incomes replaced by CERB payments or other income-support measures 
and have benefited temporarily from deferred debt payments. Nonetheless, 
some of these households will face prolonged income losses, which could 
push up the number of financially stressed households, restraining the 
recovery of consumption.

At the same time, the incomes of other households have held up through 
this period. They are more likely to include people who earn higher incomes 
and who work in professions with few barriers to remote work. These 
households have been accumulating savings, mainly because there has 
been less to spend money on during the containment period. This suggests 
pent-up demand could help boost spending of some consumers.

Overall, the central scenario for consumption incorporates a degree of 
caution, as some households prioritize paying down debts or increasing 
precautionary savings given the uncertain economic environment. 
Insolvencies increase but do not derail the recovery.

More broadly, household spending patterns have shifted since the onset of 
the pandemic, and some of these changes may last (Chart 15). As a result, 
there is heightened uncertainty regarding the composition of consumption 
and housing demand in the central scenario and what that might imply for 
the retail and travel sectors as well as for residential construction.

In the central scenario, the effects of the downturn and lower immigration 
hold down housing activity over the next few years. After a near-term boost 
from pent-up demand, residential investment slowly increases as income 
and confidence recover.

Business investment is likely to remain weak
In the Bank’s central scenario, uncertainty about the composition and 
strength of future demand, elevated debt levels and lingering financial 
stress significantly dampen business investment. Across all regions and 
sectors, respondents to the summer Business Outlook Survey reported that 
uncertainty is weighing heavily on investment plans and suggested that their 
investment will remain weak over the next 12 months (Chart 16).

Business investment recovers slowly in the central scenario, even as 
elevated uncertainty recedes. This reflects that capacity pressures are 
quite limited overall and that some firms are scaling back or abandoning 
their investment plans, while other businesses are closing their doors 
permanently. In addition, it will take some time for businesses to reposition 
themselves and adjust their investment to reflect new demand patterns.

A lower investment path is also likely to have persistent effects on potential 
output by reducing the future capital stock. One area of relative strength, 
however, is investment in digital technology. The pandemic has already 
accelerated digitalization in some sectors. In the Business Outlook Survey, 
retailers often cited plans to further invest in online offerings, and providers 
of financial and other professional services reported spending more on 
digital technology so that staff can work from home efficiently.

The energy sector is expected to remain subdued
The current environment of low energy prices arrived just as the sector was 
beginning to emerge from a lengthy period of challenging adjustments.

Acute liquidity concerns have eased as oil prices have increased from 
their April lows and the spread between the prices of WTI and WCS has 
narrowed. Nevertheless, the sector remains under pressure, with smaller 
firms facing greater challenges than the larger, more-integrated producers.

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONetARy POliCy RePORt  •  July 2020

CANADiAN eCONOMy  23 

Restructuring within the industry, ongoing since the 2014–15 oil price shock, 
is expected to continue. Oil production has been reduced and capital 
expenditure plans have been significantly curtailed. In addition, there are 
renewed questions about the likelihood of pipelines being developed. The 
central scenario anticipates that, with weaker investment in the face of 
reduced demand and low prices, oil production is now on a considerably 
lower path than before the COVID-19 crisis.

Exports will recover at a moderate pace
Exports in the central scenario recover gradually as borders reopen further, 
international supply chains are re-established and foreign demand picks up. 
However, travel and exports of motor vehicles and energy continue to weigh 
on growth, given weaker demand for these products during the recuperation 
phase.

The current crisis could amplify pressures to relocate supply chains 
domestically, a global trend that started before the pandemic due to rising 
protectionism. In addition, in the current environment of disrupted trade, 
some of the declines in exports may be offset by substitution away from 
some imports and toward domestic goods and services.

A slow rebound in demand weighs on inflation
In the central scenario, the path for CPI inflation over the next year largely 
reflects the influence of energy prices. The dramatic decline in these prices 
in March and April will hold inflation down until early 2021 (Chart 17). After 
that, the inflation outlook depends primarily on the speed and strength at 
which demand and supply recover. Firms report that capacity could return 
quickly as the economy reopens and containment measures are lifted. They 
expect the recovery in demand to be more muted, especially in the services 
and energy sectors (Chart 18). The scenario assumes that the impact on 
supply is about 60 percent of the decline in GDP over the first half of 2020 
(Box 3).

Box 3

Estimating the economy’s supply in the wake of COVID-19
The pandemic has had large and pervasive impacts on the 
supply of goods and services in the Canadian economy . The 
nature of the supply eﬀ ects is very diﬀ erent than in past 
recessions . Supply fell dramatically when governments told 
some ﬁ rms to shut down their operations temporarily .
While certain sectors may continue to face restrictions for 
some time, many businesses are already reopening . Thus, 
much of the initial decline in supply is likely to be relatively 
short-lived and therefore not as damaging to the economy’s 
underlying productive capacity (i .e ., potential output) as 
it could have been . Intuitively, this productive capacity 
continues to exist and would have remained in use if not for 
COVID-19 . This reasoning explains this Report’s distinction 
between supply and potential output in the near term . 
Through the recuperation phase, the diﬀ erence between 
the concepts goes away . Thus, the longer-term outlook for 
supply becomes the new outlook for potential output . Over 
the longer term, both incorporate the persistent scarring 
eﬀ ects of the pandemic on investment and the working-age 
population .

A long-term perspective on potential output
The level of potential output by 2022 in the central scenario 
is almost 4 percent lower than in the January Report 
(Cha rt 3-A) . Population, business investment and labour 
productivity are all expected to follow lower trajectories .
In the near term, fewer immigrants and international 
students are expected to come to Canada because of 
travel restrictions and delays in processing new visas . As 
a result, the Canadian working-age population is expected 
to contract slightly through the middle of the year before 
returning to growth at the end of 2020 . Looking further 
ahead, the Bank assumes that the pace of people arriving 
in Canada as permanent and non-permanent residents will 
gradually return to its pre-COVID-19 rate by 2022 .
The current crisis is also assumed to have long-lasting 
adverse eﬀ ects on the productive capacity of the economy: 
changes in business and consumer behaviour, combined 
with bankruptcies and layoﬀ s, may lead to important 
structural adjustments . The reallocation of labour and 
capital across sectors will likely result in some mismatches 
of skills and obsolescence of capital, which in turn could 
weigh on investment and labour productivity .

Demand falls more than supply in the central 

Chart 3-A: 
scenario
Change since 2019Q4, quarterly data

The extraordinary nature of the COVID-19 pandemic
The Bank of Canada estimates that total supply was about 
9 percent lower in the second quarter of 2020 than in 
the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to the impact of 
containment measures . This sharp contraction in supply 
amounts to about 60 percent of the decline in gross 
domestic product (GDP) over the same period .
In the Bank’s central scenario, the short-term contraction 
in supply is assumed to be attributable to hours lost due 
to ﬁ rm shutdowns, stay-at-home orders, disruptions to 
work routines, caring for relatives at home and, to a lesser 
extent, sickness . These eﬀ ects are expected to dissipate 
as containment measures are relaxed . Some eﬀ ects are 
anticipated to persist through the ﬁ rst half of 2021 to account 
for the pandemic and ongoing challenges in some industries .
In addition, both consumer and business conﬁ dence have 
been severely shaken by the pandemic and continuing 
uncertainty about its course and economic impacts . Low 
conﬁ dence has negative eﬀ ects on demand as well as on 
supply, and these eﬀ ects last well beyond the initial easing 
of containment measures . Overall, in the Bank’s central 
scenario, demand takes longer than supply to recover in the 
near term .

Last observation: 2020Q2

Even as establishments reopen, many consumers are expected to be 
hesitant to resume their previous spending patterns, partly due to fears of 
contracting the virus. In addition, even those who did not lose their job, or 
those whose lost income was fully offset by government programs, may 
re-evaluate their need for precautionary savings. Foreign demand may be 
even slower to rebound because some trade partners are taking longer than 
Canada to contain the spread of the virus. Faced with uncertainty about 
demand, businesses are likely to cancel or postpone investment plans. 
Overall, this implies that demand will take some time to recover in line with 
supply.

In this context, weak demand explains why firms are reluctant to pass along 
cost increases associated with the pandemic. However, it is possible that 
customers will be sympathetic when price increases are clearly linked to 
these costs. This could lead to higher inflation than in the central scenario.

So far, consumer expectations of inflation over the next one to two years 
have remained firm despite the large decline in CPI inflation. In the central 
scenario, downward pressure on inflation gradually fades as demand 
recovers and economic slack diminishes. However, uncertainty is far greater 
than usual. The large declines in both demand and supply are extraordinary. 
Over a longer horizon, the pandemic could cause large and lasting changes 
in consumer preferences and other sources of demand. Similarly, the scope 
of possible structural changes to a post-pandemic economy is vast, and 
the timing of adjustments will remain unknowable as long as COVID-19 
continues to be a threat.

The Bank of Canada responded quickly and forcefully to market disruptions 
as well as to the anticipated economic consequences of the COVID-19 
pandemic and related containment measures. The Bank reduced the policy 
interest rate by 150 basis points to 25 basis points, its effective lower bound, 
and launched a number of liquidity facilities and asset purchase programs. 
The cumulative impact of these facilities and purchase programs since 
March has resulted in an exceptional increase in the size of the Bank’s 
balance sheet (Chart 19a).

While the initial intent of the facilities and programs was to restore market 
functioning, the programs all play a role in the conduct of monetary policy. 
This is because, when markets are not functioning properly, the chain of 
lending and borrowing stops working, and the ability of monetary policy to 
provide stimulus breaks down. During a crisis, central banks must ensure 
that credit can continue to flow to households and businesses. Although the 
Bank has reduced the frequency of its short-term liquidity operations since 
the improvement in market functioning, the facilities are still in place as an 
important backstop while uncertainty remains elevated.

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONetARy POliCy RePORt  •  July 2020

Large-scale secondary market purchases of Government of Canada bonds 
provide monetary stimulus through several channels and can be described 
as quantitative easing (QE).7 When markets are not functioning well, QE 
improves liquidity in the government bond market (liquidity channel). 
QE can also lower borrowing costs for businesses and households by 
putting downward pressure on government yields (interest-rate channel).8 
Through the purchase of a large quantity of government bonds held by the 
private sector, QE reduces the relative supply of bonds and thus lowers 
their relative yields, leading investors to reallocate their portfolio to riskier 
assets (portfolio balance channel). In addition, some investors will adjust 
their portfolios to include more assets priced in other currencies, placing 
downward pressure on the Canadian dollar (foreign exchange channel). 
Markets generally interpret QE as a signal that rates will likely be at the lower 
bound for an extended period (signalling channel).9

The Bank has committed to continue buying at least $5 billion of Canadian 
government bonds each week until the recovery is well underway. The 
current level of purchases is likely working to varying degrees through all 
these channels, which helps make borrowing more accessible and more 
affordable for households and businesses. Initially, the purchases were 
improving liquidity. With improved market functioning and the reopening 
of the economy, other channels are becoming more important. While the 
Bank’s balance sheet is not large compared with those of other major 
central banks, the increase in its size has been particularly rapid (Chart 19b).

The Bank’s corporate bond purchase program, through purchases of 
corporate bonds in secondary markets, has helped improve liquidity 
conditions in this market, even though purchases have been limited to 
date. As market functioning improved globally and in Canada, Canadian 
corporations became better able to access markets directly for new 
borrowing that will support continued operations. Credit easing programs 
like this one can deliver stimulus by narrowing the difference between yields 
of corporate and government bonds, bringing down borrowing costs for 
businesses.

COVID-19” (speech to the Canadian Clubs and cercles canadiens, Ottawa, June 22, 2020); and the 
Bank of Canada website.

lending channel.

exist. For more details, see Committee on the Global Financial System, “Unconventional Monetary

Alternative scenarios and risks
Alternative scenarios and risks

The central scenario for output and inflation described in this Report is highly 
conditional on the course of the pandemic, and there are many scenarios 
above and below this one in which the evolution of the pandemic is more or 
less favourable. There are also a number of economic upside and downside 
risks even if the virus evolves as assumed in the central scenario. In practice, 
public health and economic health are closely intertwined, with many of the 
economic risks likely to break to the upside (downside) if the virus evolves 
more (less) favourably than in the central scenario.

On the downside, there are a series of increasingly dire scenarios in 
which COVID-19 outbreaks increase as the economy reopens, forcing the 
reintroduction of containment measures. The broader the shutdowns, the 
bigger the economic impact. This includes the possibility of a widespread 
and possibly more severe second wave of the virus, requiring a complete 
lockdown.

Tighter global financial conditions could result if, for instance, there were 
widespread household, corporate and sovereign defaults given elevated 
debt levels. Such an outcome would threaten financial stability and likely 
cause a rapid adjustment of market prices and risk premiums. Emerging 
markets, particularly those that have not yet contained the virus, would be 
especially vulnerable and could face greater stress and a marked increase 
in capital outflows. If the pandemic takes a more dire path, trade tensions 
could be exacerbated, and global fragmentation could worsen. In Canada, 
a much weaker scenario could crystalize the risks associated with high 
household indebtedness.

On the upside, a stronger economic scenario could unfold if, for instance, 
economies reopen with minimal spread of the virus, or if a vaccine or 
effective treatment is available earlier than assumed in the central scenario. 
Such an improved scenario could lead to and in turn be bolstered by higher 
commodity prices and greater business and consumer confidence. These 
factors would likely lead to a stronger profile in exports and business 
investment, most notably in the energy and commodity sectors. If consumer 
confidence were more robust and enduring, a stronger rebound in household 
spending than the subdued recovery in the central scenario would be 
anticipated. A more positive outlook could prompt households that built up 
savings during the containment period to pick up the spending they had put 
on hold, releasing pent-up demand.

Even if the course of the pandemic is as assumed in the central scenario, 
the economic factors mentioned above could lead to stronger or weaker 
outcomes for the economic outlook, with dynamics similar to what is 
discussed here.

Canada’s Inflation-Control Strategy1
Inflation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote 

the economic and financial well-being of Canadians.

pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s 
outlook, including risks to the projection, are published four 
times per year in the Monetary Policy Report.

  Canada’s experience with inflation targeting since 1991 has 

shown that the best way to foster confidence in the value 
of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth, 
employment gains and improved living standards is by keeping 
inflation low, stable and predictable.

Inflation targeting is symmetric and flexible
  Canada’s inflation-targeting approach is symmetric, which 

means that the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising 
above or falling below the 2 per cent target.

  In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 

Canada’s inflation-control target for a further five-year period, 
ending December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the 
consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 per cent midpoint 
of the control range of 1 to 3 per cent.

  Canada’s inflation-targeting framework is flexible. Typically, 

the Bank seeks to return inflation to target over a horizon of six 
to eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for 
returning inflation to target will vary depending on the nature 
and persistence of the shocks buffeting the economy.

The monetary policy instrument
  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes in the 

target for the overnight rate of interest.2 These changes are 
transmitted to the economy through their influence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate, 
which affect total demand for Canadian goods and services. 
The balance between this demand and the economy’s 
production capacity is, over time, the primary determinant of 
inflation pressures in the economy.

  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight 
quarters—to work their way through the economy and have 
their full effect on inflation. For this reason, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent com-
munications, the Bank regularly reports its perspective on 
the forces at work on the economy and their implications for 
inflation. The Monetary Policy Report is a key element of this 
approach. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight 

Monitoring inflation
  In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in 
indirect taxes such as GST, can cause sizable fluctuations in 
CPI.

  In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through 

such transitory movements in CPI inflation and focuses on a 
set of “core” inflation measures that better reflect the under-
lying trend of inflation. In this sense, these measures act as an 
operational guide to help the Bank achieve the CPI inflation 
target. They are not a replacement for CPI inflation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core inflation are CPI-
trim, which excludes CPI components whose rates of change 
in a given month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which 
corresponds to the price change located at the 50th percentile 
(in terms of basket weight) of the distribution of price changes; 
and CPI-common, which uses a statistical procedure to track 
common price changes across categories in the CPI basket.

Inflation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide additional  monetary 

stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website, 
describes these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Global Economy

Global economic growth slowed around the world in the latter part of 2018. 
A moderation from above-potential growth was anticipated due to cyclical 
factors and the impact of trade policies. However, the slowdown was greater 
than expected in the January Monetary Policy Report. Trade policy conflicts 
and the related uncertainty, as well as temporary country-specific factors, 
have had larger effects than previously anticipated.

With accumulating evidence of slowing activity, many central banks have 
signalled a slower pace of monetary policy normalization. China announced 
additional fiscal and monetary measures. As a result of these changes, 
along with perceived progress in US–China trade talks, global financial con-
ditions have improved, and commodity prices have increased.

Uncertainty stemming from the US–China trade dispute and other trade ten-
sions is assumed to continue to weigh on sentiment, trade and investment, 
thereby restraining activity globally. Given all these factors, global growth 
is expected to pick up in the first half of 2019 as the impacts of temporary 
factors fade. Growth should average about 3 1/4 per cent over the projection 
horizon, roughly in line with potential (Table 1 and Box 1).

Box 1

Annual assessment of global potential output growth
Global potential output is expected to grow at a steady pace 
of about 3 1/4 per cent over the projection horizon (Chart 1-A) .1 
Growth of global potential output should be driven primarily 
by strong total factor productivity growth and capital 
accumulation in Chi na and other emerging-market econo-
mies . In the United States, potential output growth is antici-
pated to average just below 2 per cent, mainly due to capital 
accumulation and total factor productivity growth . Potential 
output growth in the euro area is expected to decrease 
modestly throughout the projection horizon as the drag 
from population aging increases .
Global potential output growth has been revised down by 
about 0 .1 percentage point in both 2019 and 2020, relative 
to the forecast presented in the April 2018 Report . This 
mainly refl ects two factors . First, the outlook for potential 
output growth in China and in the United States has been 
marked down because of the impact on ﬁ rm productivity 
of the trade dispute between the two countries .2 Second, 
potential output growth for the economies in the “rest of 

the world” group has been revised down over both recent 
history and the projection horizon . This accounts for a 
greater negative impact from past oil price declines on 
the capital stock and the productivity of oil-producing 
economies .

Global trade and investment growth have slowed
The recent slowdown of global activity has been broad-based across 
economies and particularly pronounced for global trade and business 
investment (Chart 1 and Chart 2). Trade policies and related uncertainty 
have played a central role in this synchronous slowdown. The total drag 
stemming from new tariffs implemented over the past two years by the 
United States and other countries and from trade policy uncertainty is now 
estimated to reduce global gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.4 per cent by 
the end of 2021, somewhat more than estimated in the January Report.1

US imports from China of products subject to tariff increases imposed in 
2018 have declined. US exports to China of goods subject to new tariffs 
recovered somewhat in early 2019 alongside progress in bilateral talks, but 
they remain significantly lower than before the imposition of the tariffs.

Other regional factors have been weighing on trade. Slowing domestic 
demand in China has been a drag on imports, particularly since the fourth 
quarter of 2018. Changes to emissions testing standards for new vehicles 
introduced in September 2018 temporarily dampened exports in the euro 
area.

1  The Bank’s base-case scenario continues to assume an orderly Brexit, with modest negative effects 
from uncertainty. The US tariff increases on Chinese products scheduled for March have been post-
poned while trade negotiations are underway. The Bank’s convention is to assume that announced 
policy will take effect. Without official announcements that tariff increases are cancelled, the Bank’s 
base-case projection assumes that they will take place in the second quarter of 2019.

In addition, the weakness in trade is likely exacerbated by lower demand for 
upgrades of electronic goods: global shipments of cell phones and personal 
computers both declined in 2018.

The recent dynamics of global trade are amplifying a slowdown that is 
occurring for structural reasons. For instance, one such reason for declining 
trade is associated with reshoring or nearshoring in conjunction with a shift 
toward more technology-intensive production.2, 3

the Nunavut Mining Symposium, Iqaluit, Nunavut, April 1, 2019).

3  Reshoring consists of transferring back to the country business operations that had previously been 

moved overseas. Nearshoring consists of transferring to a nearby country operations that were done in 
a more distant one.

US growth to slow to a more sustainable pace
The US expansion moderated at the end of 2018, partly reflecting the impact 
on household spending of past increases in interest rates. Residential 
investment contracted for the fourth quarter in a row in response to 
declining affordability. In addition, tariffs and trade tensions have increas-
ingly weighed on exports and imports. Meanwhile, business investment 
continued to grow at a strong pace, supported by the 2018 tax changes and 
deregulation (Chart 3).

Recent indicators continue to suggest healthy US growth in the first quarter 
of 2019 despite the disruptions caused by the US government shutdown. US 
activity is still supported by solid employment gains in recent months, rising 
wage growth and elevated consumer and business confidence.

After expanding at a robust pace last year, economic growth is forecast 
to slow to around 2¼ per cent in 2019 and further to about 1 3/4 per cent 
in 2020 and 2021. The slowdown in growth is largely in response to past 
increases in interest rates and the waning effects of fiscal stimulus. Core 
inflation is expected to remain close to 2 per cent.

Euro area growth has disappointed
In the euro area, the recent experience of weaker-than-expected growth 
continued into the fourth quarter of 2018. The manufacturing sector experi-
enced a broad-based contraction, and the Purchasing Managers’ Index 
indicates ongoing weakness into the first quarter of 2019. Consumer confi-
dence also deteriorated. This suggests that the headwinds associated with 
Brexit, global trade uncertainties and domestic factors, such as fiscal chal-
lenges in Italy and protests in France, have been more important than previ-
ously assessed.

Some of these headwinds are anticipated to continue to dampen eco-
nomic activity over the projection horizon. Growth is nevertheless expected 
to improve in the first half of 2019 as the impacts of some temporary fac-
tors recede, including the effects of last September’s changes to emissions 
testing standards for new vehicles.

Core inflation is still tepid and is anticipated to increase only gradually.

Policy is supporting growth in China
With ongoing trade tensions and past deleveraging, the Chinese economy 
has continued its gradual slowing. In response to softer momentum, author-
ities have enacted modest fiscal and monetary stimulus policies in recent 
months. These measures have helped to improve consumer confidence 
and industrial production since the beginning of the year. Nonetheless, 
growth is expected to moderate from about 6 1/2 per cent in 2018 to just 
below 6 per cent by the end of the projection period. Chinese authorities 
have signalled that they would provide additional policy support should it be 
needed. High corporate debt levels and trade tensions could continue to be 
challenges to growth.

Economic activity was weak in other oil-importing emerging-market economies 
(EMEs) in the second half of 2018. This weakness reflected slower growth in 
India, Brazil and Mexico, as well as recessions in Turkey and Argentina. While 
the recessions in these two countries should persist over the first half of this 
year, overall growth in oil-importing EMEs is expected to pick up, supported 
by rebounds in India and Brazil. Cuts to oil production by some members of 
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are expected 
to be a drag on these economies over the first six months of 2019.

Global financial conditions have improved
In response to slowing economic growth, many central banks have sig-
nalled a slower pace of monetary policy normalization. Consistent with the 
moderation of the global economy and central bank communications, nom-
inal yields on government bonds have decreased. At the same time, credit 
spreads have narrowed and equity prices have increased.

In Canada and the United States, yields on 10-year government bonds 
have been fluctuating around the yields on three-month treasury bills. The 
recent episode of a negative spread between these two yields (yield-curve 
inversion) was modest and short-lived and accompanied by improve-
ments in other financial indicators. In the past, yield-curve inversions have 
often occurred before recessions, especially in the US economy (Chart 4).4 
However, these inversions were typically the result of short-term interest 
rates rising persistently above long-term rates rather than because long-
term rates were falling, as has been observed over the past couple of 
months. In recent years, structural factors, such as increased public and pri-
vate sector demand for high-quality government securities, have contributed 
to lower long-term yields. In this context, inversions should be expected to 
occur more frequently and, unless large and persistent, should be regarded 
as less informative about future growth than they have been in the past.

4  Box 2 of the October 2018 Report discusses the predictive properties of the yield curve and other 

market-based measures.

Prices of most commodities have moved higher
The prices of Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil have increased 
since January. Oil prices rose in response to improved market sentiment, 
a greater-than-expected output cut in Saudi Arabia and risks of falling pro-
duction in Iran, Venezuela and Libya. In its projection, the Bank assumes 
that the prices of Brent and WTI oil will remain close to their recent average 
levels (Box 2, page 10, and Chart 5).

Uncertainty around the future path for global oil prices remains elevated. 
The most important considerations relate to OPEC policy and geopolitical 
risks to production. As well, US shale output could increase at a faster pace 
than expected.

The spread between WTI and Western Canadian Select has narrowed to 
around US$10. The spread is being compressed in part by mandatory pro-
duction curtailments in Alberta. In addition, US sanctions against Venezuela 
have increased the demand for Canadian heavy oil.

The Bank’s non-energy commodity price index is about 3 per cent higher 
than in January. Many prices have risen because of improved market senti-
ment, with idiosyncratic supply factors providing additional support to the 
prices of base metals and hogs. However, Canadian canola prices have 
fallen following recent actions by the Chinese government.

Canadian Economy

Trade tensions and elevated uncertainty have been important drivers of 
the growth dynamic for both the global and Canadian economies, although 
some factors specific to Canada are playing a role. The Canadian economy 
was operating close to potential, then slowed in the fourth quarter of 
last year. After a soft patch at the beginning of 2019, economic growth is 
expected to pick up.

The dampening effects on growth of low oil prices, changes to housing poli-
cies and the 2017–18 increases in borrowing rates should dissipate over 
2019. Improvements in financial conditions since the beginning of 2019, con-
tinuing strong immigration and sustained global expansion are expected to 
support growth over the projection horizon. The pace of economic activity 
is projected to increase from 1.2 per cent in 2019 to about 2 per cent in 
2020 and 2021 (Table 2, Table 3 and Box 2).

Compared with the projection in the January Report, the outlook for growth 
in 2019 has been revised down and is largely unchanged for 2020. The 
markdown reflects mainly that the economy in the fourth quarter of 2018 
and the first quarter of 2019 was weaker than anticipated.

real GDP growth was available at the time the projection was conducted. For longer horizons, fourth-
quarter-over-fourth-quarter percentage changes are presented.

The Bank has reviewed its estimates of potential output growth and the 
neutral rate of interest (Appendix and Box 3). The midpoints of the ranges 
for both have been revised down slightly. Overall, the Bank judges that the 
economy was operating with modest excess capacity in the first quarter of 
2019.

Core measures of inflation have continued to hover near 2 per cent. 
Consumer price index (CPI) inflation declined to 1.6 per cent in the first 
quarter of 2019, primarily reflecting past declines in gasoline prices. Through 
the projection horizon, inflation is expected to remain close to 2 per cent.

Box 2

Key inputs to the base-case projection
The Bank’s projection is always conditional on several key 
assumptions, and changes to them will aﬀ ect the base-case 
scenario . The Bank regularly reviews these assumptions and 
assesses the sensitivity of the economic projection to them . 
The Bank’s current assumptions are as follows:
•  Global oil prices are assumed to remain near recent 
average levels . The per-barrel prices in US dollars for 
Brent and West Texas Intermediate have recently aver-
aged close to $70 and $60, respectively . These prices 
are about $10 higher than assumed in the January 
Report . The Bank’s projections for production and 
exports of Canadian oil are anchored by transportation 
capacity rather than by an assumption about the price of 
Western Canadian Select .

•  By convention, the Bank does not forecast the exchange 

rate in its base-case projection . The Canadian dollar 
is assumed to remain at 75 cents over the projection 
horizon, close to its recent average and broadly in line 
with the 74 cents assumed in the January Report .

•  The Bank estimates that the output gap was in a range 

of -1 .25 to -0 .25 per cent in the ﬁ rst quarter of 2019 . This 
compares with the January assumption that the output 
gap in the fourth quarter of 2018 was in a range of -1 .0 to 
0 .0 per cent .1

•  Growth in Canadian potential outp ut is assumed to 
average 1 .8 per cent over 2019 through 2021 and to 
reach 1 .9 per cent in 2022 . Details on the Bank’s assess-
ment of potential output growth are provided in the 
Appendix .

•  The Bank conducted its annual re-evaluation of its esti-
mate of the neutral rate in conjunction with its annual 
reassessment of potential output . For Canada, the neu-
tral rate is currently estimated to be between 2 .25 and 
3 .25 per cent (Box 3) .

1  The annual reassessment of potential output suggests that productive capacity 
has been about 0 .2 per cent lower than previously assessed and that the output 
gap in the fourth quarter of 2018 was in a range of -0 .75 to 0 .25 per cent . The 
Bank estimates that the output gap widened in the ﬁ rst quarter of 2019 with GDP 
growth weaker than potential .

The neutral rate is not observable, and there is considerable 
uncertainty surrounding it . The overall assessment conveys 
a methodological range constructed by aggregating the 
most likely ranges derived from each of the four approaches 
(Table 3-A) . These ranges capture the sensitivity of the 
estimate of the neutral rate to diﬀ erent values for key par-
ameters and other inputs . A statistical range refl ecting all 
sources of uncertainty would be larger .
The Bank judges that the neutral range is 0 .25 percentage 
points lower than assessed in April 2018 as a result of addi-
tional information and improved modelling . The most likely 
ranges of the three models other than the closed-economy 
model are lower, mainly due to additional information that 
the global neutral rate, an important input, has likely been 
0 .25 percentage points lower tha n was previously assessed . 
With the changes to capture risk, the closed-economy neo-
classical growth model provides a range that is consistent 
with the new lower range .

Neutral rate
The neutral nominal policy rate is the sum of two compon-
ents: (i) the real rate that is consistent with output at its 
potential level and infl ation at target once the eﬀ ects of 
any cyclical shocks have dissipated, and (ii) 2 per cent to 
account for the rate of infl ation at target .
The Bank estimates that the Canadian neutral rate likely 
lies in a range of 2 .25 to 3 .25 per cent in nominal terms .1 
The assessment is based on staﬀ  analysis that uses a suite 
of four distinct but complementary approaches, each 
emphasizing the role of diﬀ erent factors in determining 
the neutral rate:
•  a pure interest rate parity condition under which capital 
is assumed to fl ow freely across international borders . 
This implies that the Canadian and global neutral rates 
coincide, thus placing full emphasis on foreign factors .

•  a closed-economy neoclassical growth model that 
focuses on domestic factors . This model has been 
revised to capture the impact of macroeconomic risk on 
the level of the neutral rate .2

•  a reduced-form model that combines domestic and 

foreign factors . It ﬁ nds that foreign factors play a quan-
titatively more important role in determining the level of 
the Canadian neutral rate .

•  a small open economy model with overlapping genera-

tions . This model captures demographic factors that are 
mostly absent in the other models .

1  The Bank’s range is similar to that indicated by the longer-run assessment of the 

federal funds rate in the Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections 
from March 2019 . The longer-run projections fell in a range of 2 .5 to 3 .5 per 
cent . Notably, the median of the projections was 2 .75 per cent, and 14 of 
16 respondents provided a projection between 2 .5 and 3 .0 per cent .

Bank of Canada Staﬀ  Analytical Note No . 2019-11 (April 2019) . As the note explains, 
households tend to respond to greater risk by increasing their demand for safe 
assets, which puts downward pressure on the neutral rate, all else being equal .

Growth to pick up in the second quarter of 2019
The pace of economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2018 was weaker than 
expected, although the impact of lower oil prices on GDP has been roughly in 
line with the Bank’s estimates. Business investment and exports were lower 
than anticipated, largely reflecting slower global demand and a greater impact 
from trade policy issues. Also, firms may have delayed investment spending 
in anticipation of the new Accelerated Investment Incentive announced in 
the federal government’s Fall Economic Statement. Further, past changes 
in housing policies together with the 2017–18 increases in borrowing rates 
appear to be having larger and more prolonged effects on residential invest-
ment and components of consumption that are sensitive to changes in 
interest rates.

Weak growth is estimated to have continued into the first quarter of 2019, 
with softness in several components of demand. Recent data indicate 
broad-based weakness in exports of goods. Ongoing adjustment in the 
oil and gas sector is estimated to have held back investment (Chart 6). 
Residential investment activity was also likely weak again in the first quarter, 
reflecting the ongoing transition in the composition of housing demand 
and construction to more affordable residences (Chart 7). At the same 
time, consumption is estimated to have strengthened, supported by strong 
income gains and elevated consumer confidence.

The slowing of growth has primarily occurred in goods-producing industries, 
such as construction as well as energy and its supporting activities. Since 
drivers of the recent weakness in trade are viewed as largely temporary, 
the Bank estimates that growth will pick up in the second quarter of 2019

(Table 3 and Chart 8). The near-term outlook incorporates a large swing 
in inventories to reconcile mixed signals from production and expenditure 
indicators.

The Bank has revised its outlook for the first quarter of 2019 down relative 
to the January Report. Investment and export levels are lower, reflecting 
greater effects of uncertainty and weaker global demand. As well, activity in 
the housing market is expected to stabilize later than previously anticipated.

The economy has a modest degree of excess capacity
The Canadian economy was operating near capacity for most of 
2017 and 2018. However, as a result of recent slow economic growth, the 
Bank estimates that the output gap was between -1.25 and -0.25 per cent 
in the first quarter of 2019 (Box 2). The degree of slack is not generalized 
across the entire economy since the slowing of activity is more concen-
trated in some industries and regions than in others.

In the spring Business Outlook Survey fewer firms reported capacity pres-
sures as more intense compared with a year ago, in some cases because 
they have recently expanded production capacity or hired additional 
workers (Chart 9). The view that labour shortages have intensified has also 
become less widespread.

Overall, the labour market continues to be healthy. The number of job vacan-
cies was near its record high in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the pace of 
hiring has been strong, particularly in the services industry and outside oil-
intensive regions.5 Regional differences are also evident in wage growth, 
which was about 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018 in oil-intensive 
regions and 2.6 per cent in other provinces. Nationally, wages increased by 
2.1 per cent.

Further evidence that the labour market is healthy shows up in wage 
increases for job changers. It is generally easier for workers to find jobs that 
better match their skill sets when demand for labour is strong and broad-
based. When workers move to jobs that make better use of their skills, 
wage increases tend to reflect higher productivity and thus may not be 
inflationary. Empirical evidence indicates job changers have been receiving 
wage increases of about 12 per cent, considerably higher than the average 
increase.6

Last observation: March 2019

Core inflation measures have been stable and close to 2 per cent for more 
than a year, consistent with an economy operating near capacity (Chart 10). 
CPI inflation has been considerably more volatile, reflecting the effects of 
temporary factors. In the first quarter of 2019, inflation eased to 1.6 per cent, 
largely because gasoline prices have continued to be lower than they were 
one year ago.

Potential output growth to average about 1.8 per cent
In this Report, the Bank provides its annual reassessment of potential 
output growth. The midpoint of the range for potential output growth is esti-
mated to be slightly lower than in the April 2018 Report, at 1.8 per cent on 
average between 2019 and 2021 and at 1.9 per cent in 2022 (Appendix). 
Softer business investment relative to the April 2018 Report reduces the 
projected growth rate of trend labour productivity. This effect is largely 
offset by strong immigration, which boosts growth of the working-age popu-
lation and contributes to a forecast of higher trend labour input growth.

Over time, growth of trend labour productivity is expected to improve as 
the drag on investment growth from the oil sector and elevated trade policy 
uncertainty wanes. Meanwhile, trend labour input growth will continue to 
slow because of population aging. The Bank’s assessment of potential 
output is subject to considerable uncertainty. The estimates are presented 
as a range that captures some of the uncertainty (Table 2).

Excess capacity to be absorbed over the projection horizon
GDP growth is expected to increase from 1.2 per cent in 2019 to about 
2.0 per cent in 2020 and 2021 (Table 2 and Table 3). The Bank projects that 
the economy will gradually strengthen through 2019 and will grow slightly 
above potential in 2020 and 2021 (Chart 11).

The steady expansion of services industries is expected to continue and 
plays an integral role driving solid job gains and income growth. In this con-
text, the rebound in GDP growth in the base-case projection mainly reflects

an improvement in goods industries. In particular, by 2020, the adjustment 
to previous declines in oil prices or past changes to housing policies will no 
longer weigh on growth.

Compared with that in the January Report, the projection for economic 
growth in 2019 has been marked down by 0.5 percentage points. About 
one-third of this change reflects the weaker-than-expected growth at the 
end of 2018, and most of the rest is due to the downward revision to growth 
in the first half of 2019. For 2020, the projection for growth remains broadly 
unchanged.

Overall, trade tensions and related uncertainty, weaker foreign demand and 
past housing policies are having somewhat greater adverse effects on the 
forecasted profile for output than previously anticipated. In addition, the 
contribution of fiscal spending to growth has been marked down. The new 
federal budget and provincial budgets for Quebec and British Columbia are 
each somewhat positive for economic activity. However, the new Ontario 
budget has considerably less spending than was assumed in the projection 
in the January Report. The January assumption was largely based on the 
multi-year trajectory embedded in the 2018 Ontario budget. The effects of 
all of these developments are only partially offset by those associated with 
higher commodity prices and more favourable financing conditions.

Growth of household spending to rise as effects of past 
policy changes fade
The outlook for consumption and housing is underpinned by strong employ-
ment and solid wage gains. By 2020, provincial and municipal housing 
market policies and tighter mortgage finance guidelines are no longer 
expected to slow household spending growth.

In addition, the improvement in financial conditions has a positive influence 
on spending. For instance, with the recent easing of household borrowing 
rates, mortgage payments of households renegotiating their five-year fixed-
rate mortgages would be expected to rise by less than in the illustration in 
Box 3 of the July 2018 Report.

Consumption is expected to grow moderately (Chart 12). Elevated indebted-
ness together with concerns about changing house prices are anticipated 
to contribute to households becoming more cautious in their consumption 
decisions. In oil-intensive regions, the ongoing adjustment of the energy 
sector is expected to continue to dampen household spending. The profile 
for consumption overall is consistent with a savings rate that is increasing 
from a low level over the projection horizon.

National housing metrics are anticipated to mask regional differences 
through 2019. For instance, the effects on growth of the revised B-20 guide-
line are expected to dissipate in many markets, although they could per-
sist longer in areas with elevated house prices and that have been subject 
to other changes to housing policies. The stabilization of expectations for 
house prices in British Columbia and Ontario may indicate a forthcoming 
stabilization and subsequent increase in resale activity (Chart 13).7 The 
changes to municipal and provincial policies to address speculation, com-
bined with the B-20 revisions, are having more pronounced effects in the 
Greater Vancouver Area (GVA) than in the Greater Toronto Area. Thus, while 
stabilization of activity is expected this year in the base-case projection, 
there is a risk that it could be delayed in the GVA. Meanwhile, ongoing chal-
lenges in the oil industry are expected to continue to weigh on the Alberta 
housing market. In contrast, a strong economy and investor interest is 
expected to boost the market in Montréal.

Last observation: 2019Q1

The First-Time Home Buyer Incentive introduced in the 2019 federal budget 
is expected to support housing demand and may also lead to improving 
sentiment in the housing market. However, delays in purchases by home-
buyers who want to take advantage of the new measure could influence the 
timing of resale activity in 2019.8

After declining for two years, residential investment is expected to expand 
modestly in 2020 and 2021. Given the trend reduction in housing afford-
ability, construction of multi-unit residences is expected to resume its trend 
increase to meet demand for less-expensive homes.

Business investment outside the oil and gas sector to 
rebound
The Bank expects a gradual expansion in investment outside the oil and gas 
sector starting in the first half of 2019, with solid growth in the second half of 
the year and continuing through the projection horizon (Chart 14). Business 
investment should be motivated by capacity constraints, elevated operating 
profits, favourable financing costs and the federal and Ontario governments’ 
investment incentives. This forecast continues to incorporate judgment that 
elevated uncertainty is holding back investment. In the projection, trade 
uncertainty is assumed to reduce the level of business investment by about 
2.5 per cent by the end of 2021.9

8  Details on this measure are available in Budget 2019: An Affordable Place to Call Home.
9  Since April 2017, the Bank’s base-case scenarios have incorporated some negative judgment 
on investment and exports to account for the effects of uncertainty around trade policy. In the 
January 2019 Report, the judgment capturing the impact of uncertainty removed 1.8 per cent from 
the level of investment by the end of 2020. Judgment has increased in this Report because part of the 
unexplained weakness in investment has been attributed to uncertainty.

In the spring Business Outlook Survey, firms not exposed to the energy 
sector reported intentions to increase capital spending to meet anticipated 
demand and improve productivity, though many cited regulatory hurdles 
or uncertainty. These spending intentions were particularly concentrated 
among services-oriented firms. The survey results are consistent with the 
view that ongoing digitalization of business activity is encouraging capital 
spending in areas such as research and development, software and com-
puter equipment.

Transportation constraints to restrain the energy sector
The oil and gas sector continues to undergo structural adjustment. The 
Bank expects that the level of investment in the oil and gas sector in 2019 
will be about 20 per cent lower than its 2017 plateau. This contraction fol-
lows the steep decline of roughly 50 per cent that occurred between 
2014 and 2016.

Developments in the sector have dampened business sentiment. For 
instance, several firms in the Prairies responding to the spring Business 
Outlook Survey cited uncertainty around the outlook for the sector, as well 
as transportation constraints and other industry-specific regulations, as 
impediments to investment. Following the 2019 decline, energy investment 
is anticipated to remain relatively stable over the remainder of the projection 
horizon.

Energy exports are expected to decline in 2019 and then recover and 
grow moderately over the remainder of the projection horizon. The Bank 
assumes that oil production and exports will correspond roughly to the 
available transportation capacity. Production curtailments have been 
eased and are assumed to be phased out in the future. In this context, the 
Bank’s projections for production and exports of Canadian oil are anchored

by transportation capacity rather than by an assumption about the price 
of Western Canadian Select. The Enbridge Line 3 replacement program 
has been delayed until the end of 2020, and crude-by-rail shipments are 
expected to expand. Rail is anticipated to be the marginal mode of transpor-
tation for Canadian oil exports.10

Non-energy exports to expand moderately
Global trade policies and challenges related to competitiveness are antici-
pated to continue to be impediments to exports. In addition, the Bank 
assumes that trade uncertainty reduces the level of exports by about 
1.2 per cent by the end of 2021.11 Nevertheless, growth of non-commodity 
exports is projected to be broad-based outside the auto sector (Chart 15). 
The expansion of foreign demand and rising production capacity will sup-
port moderate growth.

Exports of services are forecast to continue growing at a strong pace, fur-
ther increasing services’ share of non-commodity exports. In particular, 
travel services, which includes tuition and other spending in Canada by 
foreign students, and foreign sales of commercial services should be 
important contributors to export growth. Exports of goods, excluding autos, 
are expected to pick up over the projection horizon, supported by growing 
US private demand.

10  Crude-by-rail shipments are expected to expand and reach about 550,000 barrels per day by the end 

of 2021.

11  In the January Report, the judgment capturing the impact of uncertainty removed 0.8 per cent from the 

level of exports by the end of 2020. Judgment has been increased in this Report because part of the 
recent unexplained weakness in exports has been attributed to uncertainty.

CanaDian EConoMy  21 

Non-energy commodity exports are expected to grow modestly, gener-
ally benefiting from higher global prices. For example, some agricultural 
exports are projected to increase as global demand and prices for food 
rise. Nevertheless, trade conflicts are affecting some agricultural industries, 
particularly in 2019. For instance, a Chinese ban of canola imports from 
major Canadian producers led to a decline in Canadian canola prices and is 
expected to weigh on exports.

After expanding in 2018, imports are expected to decline slightly in 2019, 
mainly reflecting softer domestic demand and the contraction of the auto 
sector. Import growth should then increase gradually over the remainder of 
the projection horizon, consistent with the pickup in business investment 
growth.

CPI inflation to be close to 2 per cent
The return of CPI inflation to close to 2 per cent is expected to occur earlier 
than in the January Report. With oil prices somewhat firmer than previously 
assumed, the drag from gasoline prices is now anticipated to be smaller.

However, gasoline prices are expected to contribute negatively to infla-
tion through most of 2019. Meanwhile, a temporary surge in airfare and the 
implementation of the new federal carbon pollution charge on fossil fuels 
are anticipated to provide a modest boost to inflation. As a result, inflation is 
expected to be close to 2 per cent in the second quarter of 2019 (Chart 16).

Inflation is forecast to remain close to 2 per cent through 2020 and 2021. 
Modest excess capacity is expected to subtract about 0.1 percentage point 
from inflation in 2020, while the annual increase in the federal carbon pollu-
tion charge adds less than 0.1 percentage point.

The base-case projection provides the Bank’s view of the most likely out-
come for inflation, although any projection is subject to considerable 
uncertainty. Based on the past distribution of private sector forecasts, a rea-
sonable range around the base-case projection for CPI inflation is ±0.3 per-
centage points. A complementary perspective is provided using statistical 
analysis of the Bank’s forecast errors. This perspective suggests that a 
50 per cent confidence band around the base-case projection widens from 
±0.2 percentage points in the second quarter of 2019 to ±0.6 percentage 
points by the end of 2021. Over the same period, a 90 per cent confidence 
band widens from ±0.6 to ±1.4 percentage points.

The projection is consistent with medium- and long-term inflation expect-
ations remaining well anchored. Almost all respondents to the spring 
Business Outlook Survey continue to anticipate inflation will remain 
within the Bank’s target range of 1 to 3 per cent over the next two years, 
although more now expect inflation to be in the lower half of the range. The 
March 2019 Consensus Economics forecast for CPI inflation is 1.7 per cent 
in 2019 and 2.0 per cent in 2020. Responses to a quarterly question on long-
term inflation expectations show an average of 1.9 per cent through 2029.

Risks to the inflation outlook

The outlook for inflation is subject to several upside and downside risks. 
Overall, the Bank assesses that the risks to the projected path for inflation 
are roughly balanced. The evolution since January of some of the key risks 
is summarized in Table 4. As in past reports, the focus is on those risks 
identified as the most important to the projected path for inflation, drawing 
from a larger set of risks considered in the projection.

(i)  Global trade tensions ( and )

This risk relates to trade policy conflicts between the United States 
and its trading partners, the fact that the Canada-United States-
Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) has yet to be ratified and the further 
extension of Brexit negotiations. 

If tensions persist or escalate, Canadian exports and business invest-
ment could suffer from additional weakening in foreign demand, a 
disruption in global value chains, falling business confidence and 
lower commodity prices. At the same time, inflationary pressures 
could result from a lower Canadian dollar or the increase in global 
input costs associated with higher tariffs and lower productivity.

If the United States and China were to reach a broad agreement 
on trade issues, global and Canadian economic activity would be 
stronger than in the base-case projection. As well, the near-term 
upward pressure on prices from tariffs would be removed.

(ii)  Stronger real GDP growth in the United States ()

US GDP growth could be stronger than in the base-case projection 
if recent US tax and regulatory changes boost US investment and 
potential output growth by more than anticipated. It is also possible 
that additional US fiscal stimulus measures could be enacted to avoid 
a material decline in growth in 2020. Canadian investment and exports 
would both benefit from stronger US activity.

(iii)  Sharp tightening of global financial conditions ()

Financial conditions could tighten suddenly through an increase in 
government bond yields or a repricing of corporate credit, possibly 
triggered by higher-than-expected inflation in a major advanced 
economy. Higher bond yields in advanced economies could lead to 
large capital outflows from EMEs, exacerbating country-specific vul-
nerabilities in some cases. These developments could translate into a 
rise in debt-service burdens, a decline in activity in sectors sensitive 
to interest rates, lower commodity prices and weaker global and 
Canadian economic growth.

 

 

24  RisKs to thE inFlation outlooK 

banK oF CanaDa  •  MonEtaRy PoliCy REPoRt  •  aPRil 2019

 

(iv)  Stronger consumption and rising household debt in Canada 

( and )
While consumption growth has slowed markedly in recent quarters, 
persistently elevated consumer confidence and solid labour income 
growth could lead to stronger consumer spending over the projection 
horizon. This outcome would be accompanied by a flat savings rate or 
one that has a more moderate increase than in the base-case projec-
tion. However, the vulnerabilities associated with household indebted-
ness would be exacerbated if the additional spending were financed 
by more borrowing. This would increase the impact on consumption 
of an adverse shock in the longer term.

(v)  Weaker underlying growth in some major economies ()

High levels of public and private debt in some major economies could 
pose a greater-than-expected drag on the growth prospects of the 
global economy. Countries with a high public debt could face fiscal 
consolidation. In addition, structural adjustment in some economies 
could hold back growth. Weaker global demand could lead to a 
decrease in commodity prices and would restrain growth of Canadian 
investment and exports.

(vi)  More pronounced housing weakness in Canada ()

Although partially realized and incorporated into a weaker outlook 
for housing in the base-case projection, further downside risks 
remain. Pronounced weakness in residential investment points to 
the possibility that policy changes could have even greater and more 
prolonged effects than previously expected. If this were the case, 
housing demand would be weaker than in the base-case projec-
tion. This weaker demand would put additional downward pressure 
on house prices, notably in markets where imbalances remain. The 
result could be mutually reinforcing declines in house prices, housing 
resales and construction.

Potential output

Potential output is expected to grow on average by 1.8 per cent over 
2019 through 2021 and at 1.9 per cent in 2022 (Table A-1).12 Potential output 
growth has two components: growth in trend labour productivity (output per 
hour worked) and growth in trend labour input (total hours worked).

Relative to the April 2018 assessment, both trend labour productivity and 
trend labour input have been revised substantially. Potential output growth 
is, however, only slightly lower because revisions to these two components 
mostly offset each other (Chart A-1). Relative to April 2018, the downward 
revisions to both historical data and the projection for business invest-
ment lead to less accumulation of capital, which implies slower growth in 
trend labour productivity. The main driver for the weaker outlook for busi-
ness investment growth is the more-intense challenges in the energy sector. 
Meanwhile, trend labour input growth is revised up, mostly due to stronger 
immigration and a higher number of non-permanent residents than in last 
year’s assessment.

Over time, trend labour productivity growth is expected to rise from 
0.7 per cent in 2019 to 1.1 per cent in 2022, roughly its long-term average. 
Trend labour productivity growth has been below its long-term average in 
recent years, primarily due to the economy adjusting to lower commodity 
prices and suppressed investment related to uncertainty.

Trend labour input growth is estimated to slow from 1.1 per cent in 2019 to 
0.8 per cent in 2022. The declining growth rate mainly reflects the aging of 
the population. For instance, the trend employment rate is expected to con-
tinue declining because older workers (those 55 years old or older) are less 
likely to be employed than younger workers and, when employed, typically 
work fewer hours. Immigration will remain important because it will account 
for about three-quarters of the growth of Canada’s population and will pro-
vide some offset to population aging.

Potential output is highly uncertain because its components are unobserved 
and difficult to forecast. To capture uncertainty, a range is constructed 
around midpoint estimates. The outlook for potential output is subject to 
upside and downside risks, including uncertainty related to business invest-
ment, the pace of technological progress and structural changes to the 
labour market.

  The outlook for business investment depends on how the oil and gas 

sector adapts to sectoral developments and on the persistence of trade 
policy uncertainty. How these factors evolve could tilt the profiles of trend 
labour productivity and potential output above or below the estimates in 
the base case.

  Technological improvements generally boost potential output. Artificial 

intelligence and digitalization, for example, are expected to increase 
labour productivity in the long run. The magnitude and timing of the 
effects on potential output of these and other new technologies are, how-
ever, uncertain.

  New disruptive technologies may result in resources being reallocated 
across sectors during a transition period. Depending on whether these 
new technologies lead to fewer or more jobs, the impact on trend labour 
input could be negative or positive.

Canada’s infl ation-control strategy
Canada’s infl ation-control strategy
Infl ation targeting and the economy
  The objective of Canada's monetary policy is to promote the 

economic and fi nancial well-being of Canadians. Canada’s 
experience with infl ation targeting since 1991 has shown that the 
best way that monetary policy can achieve this goal is by maintaining 
a low and stable infl ation environment. Doing so fosters confi dence 
in the value of money and contributes to sustained economic growth, 
a strong and inclusive labour market and improved living standards.
In 2021, the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada 
renewed the fl exible infl ation-targeting framework for a further 
fi ve-year period, ending December 31, 2026.1 

 

  The infl ation target was renewed at the 2% midpoint of the 1%–3% 

control range, with infl ation measured as the 12-month rate of 
change in the consumer price index (CPI). 

  The Government and the Bank agreed that the best contribution 

monetary policy can make to the economic and fi nancial 
well-being of Canadians is to continue to focus on price stability. 
The Government and the Bank also agreed that monetary policy 
should continue to support maximum sustainable employment, 
recognizing that maximum sustainable employment is not directly 
measurable and is determined largely by non-monetary factors 
that can change through time. 

  Further, the Government and the Bank agreed that because 

well-anchored infl ation expectations are critical to achieving both 
price stability and maximum sustainable employment, the primary 
objective of monetary policy is to maintain low, stable infl ation over 
time. 

Infl ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible
  Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means 

the Bank is equally concerned about infl ation rising above or falling 
below the 2% target. 

 

  Canada’s infl ation-targeting framework is also ﬂ exible. Typically, 
the Bank seeks to return infl ation to target over a horizon of six to 
eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning 
infl ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence 
of the shocks buffeting the economy.

  The 2021 agreement with the Government specifi es that the 2% 

infl ation target remains the cornerstone of the framework. 

  The agreement further notes that the Bank will continue to use the 

fl exibility of the 1%–3% control range to actively seek the maximum 
sustainable level of employment, when conditions warrant. The Bank 
will also continue to leverage the fl exibility inherent in the framework 
to help address the challenges of structurally low interest rates by 
using a broad set of policy tools. The Bank will use this fl exibility only 
to an extent that is consistent with keeping medium-term infl ation 
expectations well anchored at 2%.

Monetary policy tools
  Because monetary policy actions take time to work their way through 

the economy and have their full effect on infl ation, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.

  The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes 
in the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate). The 
Bank also has a range of monetary policy tools it can use when the 
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on 
the future evolution of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases 
(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures, 
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these 
tools would depend on the economic and fi nancial market context.

  All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for 

Canadian goods and services through their infl uence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The 
balance between this demand and the economy’s production 
capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl ation 
pressures in the economy.

Communications
  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent communications, 

the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the economy and 
infl ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight pre-set 
days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s outlook are 
published four times each year in the Monetary Policy Report.

  The Bank is committed to explaining when it is using the fl exibility of 

the infl ation-targeting framework.

  Given the uncertainty about the maximum sustainable level of 

employment, the Bank will consider a broad range of labour market 
indicators.2 The Bank will also systematically report to Canadians on 
how labour market outcomes have factored into its policy decisions.

Monitoring infl ation
 

In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile and can cause sizable fl uctuations in CPI infl ation.
In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such 
transitory movements in CPI infl ation and focuses on a set of “core” 
infl ation measures that better refl ect the underlying trend of infl ation. 
In this sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the 
Bank achieve the CPI infl ation target. They are not a replacement for 
CPI infl ation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl ation are CPI-trim, 
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given 
month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which corresponds to 
the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket 
weight) of the distribution of price changes; and CPI-common, which 
uses a statistical procedure to track common price changes across 
categories in the CPI basket.

Overview
Overview

A robust economic recovery continued throughout the second half of 2021 
in Canada and abroad. Taking into account the faster-than-expected growth 
and strong job gains, the Bank judges that economic slack is now essentially 
absorbed.

The Omicron variant of COVID-19 emerged in late autumn, triggering 
household cautiousness and public health measures. These are temporarily 
slowing economic activity globally. The economic impacts of Omicron in 
Canada will likely be limited by high vaccination rates and the continuing 
adaptability of businesses and households (Box 1).   
Disruptions to global supply chains have broadened and become more 
pronounced, pushing inflation higher in most advanced and emerging-market 
economies (EMEs). In response to inflationary pressures, some central banks 
have already raised their policy interest rates, and others have signalled they 
plan to do so.

Key messages  
  The Canadian economy had strong momentum heading into 2022.  

  A wide range of measures and indicators suggest that economic slack is now 

absorbed. Estimates of the output gap are consistent with this evidence.

  Public health measures and widespread worker absences related to the 

Omicron variant are slowing economic activity in the first quarter of 2022, 
but the economic impact is expected to be less severe than previous 
waves. 

  With the virus and related supply disruptions expected to fade, consumer 
spending is anticipated to rebound and exports and business investment 
are projected to grow solidly. 

  The impacts from global and domestic supply disruptions are currently 
exerting upward pressure on prices. Inflationary pressures from strong 
demand, supply shortages and high energy prices should subside during 
the year. Inflation is expected to decline relatively quickly to about 3% by 
the end of 2022. 

  Over the medium term, increased productivity is expected to boost supply 
growth, and demand growth is projected to moderate. Inflation is expected 
to decline gradually through 2023 and 2024 to close to 2%. 

  The Bank views the risks around this inflation outlook as roughly balanced. 

However, with inflation above the top of the Bank’s inflation-control range 
and expected to stay there for some time, the upside risks are of greater 
concern.

Overview  2 

Key inputs to the projection
The Bank of Canada’s projection is always conditional 
on several key assumptions, and changes to them will 
affect the outlook for the Canadian economy. The Bank 
regularly reviews these assumptions and assesses the 
sensitivity of the economic projection to them. The key 
inputs into the Bank’s projection are as follows:

  Vaccination rollouts are progressing in many regions 

around the world. It is assumed that most global public 
health restrictions and physical distancing measures 
will be lifted over the course of 2022. Some of these 
measures are expected to remain in place longer in 
emerging-market economies because of lower rates of 
vaccination.

  Most public health restrictions in Canada are expected 

to be eased in the fi rst quarter of 2022. Pandemic-
related effects on demand—notably, consumer caution 
and reluctance to travel—are assumed to diminish 
gradually over the projection horizon.

  As in the October projection, spending on household 

consumption is assumed to be boosted by an 
additional $40 billion as individuals draw down a 
portion of their extra savings accumulated during the 
pandemic.

  The projection incorporates information from all 

available provincial and federal budgets.

  Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent levels. 

The per-barrel prices in US dollars are assumed to be 
$80 for Brent, $75 for West Texas Intermediate and 
$65 for Western Canadian Select, as in the October 
Report.

  By convention, the Bank does not forecast the 

exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. The 
Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at 79 cents US 
over the projection horizon, close to its recent average 
and just below the 80 cents US assumed in the 
October Report.

  The pandemic is having both temporary and lasting 
effects on the supply side of the Canadian economy.1
  The Bank’s assessment of the growth of potential 
output, a longer-term concept, looks through the 
short-lived effects of factors such as containment 
measures, supply chain disruptions and labour 
market mismatches. As in the October Report, 
potential output growth is assumed to average 

about 1.6% per year over 2021–23. However, the 
level of potential output is raised by 0.3% due to 
positive historical revisions to investment, capital 
stock and gross domestic product (GDP). Despite 
these revisions, the level of potential output at the 
end of 2023 is projected to remain about 0.8% 
below the pre-pandemic estimate.2

  The projection assumes that several short-term 

factors are adversely affecting the supply of goods 
and services. First, supply chain disruptions are 
having a large, temporary impact on supply. Second, 
the mismatch between employers’ needs and 
unemployed workers’ skills—exacerbated by the 
unevenness of the pandemic shock—is contributing 
to the temporary rise in long-term unemployment. 
Together, these two effects are assumed to reduce 
supply, with a peak impact of 2.0% in the fourth 
quarter of 2021, slightly more severe than was 
estimated in October. These effects are anticipated 
to remain elevated in the fi rst half of 2022 and to 
dissipate over the rest of the year. Third, measures 
taken to contain the Omicron variant coupled with 
elevated worker absences due to the rise in cases 
are expected to decrease supply temporarily in the 
fi rst quarter of 2022 (see Chart 8 on page 16).

  Estimates of overall supply growth can be obtained 
by combining the estimates of the temporary effects 
of these short-term factors with the assessment of 
potential output.

  GDP grew at a strong pace amid increased supply 
disruptions in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Bank 
estimates that the output gap—the difference between 
GDP and supply—was about -0.75% to 0.25% in the 
fourth quarter, smaller than the estimate of -2.25% to 
-1.25% for the previous quarter.

  The neutral nominal policy interest rate is defi ned as 
the real neutral rate plus 2% for infl ation. The neutral 
real rate is defi ned as the rate consistent with both 
output remaining sustainably at its potential and 
infl ation remaining at target, on an ongoing basis. 
It is a medium- to long-term equilibrium concept. 
For Canada, the economic projection is based on 
an assumption that the nominal neutral rate is at the 
midpoint of the estimated range of 1.75% to 2.75%. This 
range was last reassessed in the April 2021 Report.

1  As in recent reports, the Bank distinguishes in the near term between supply 

and potential output to account for the relatively short-lived nature of some 
of the decrease in supply caused by public health measures, supply chain 
disruptions and labour market mismatches.

2  Estimates of the level of potential output in 2023 were not constructed as part 

of the January 2020 projection. The pre-pandemic estimate referred to in 
the text is calculated by extending the January 2020 projection for potential 
output by two years, i.e., through 2023. It uses the estimate for potential 
growth in 2021 that was provided in the January 2020 Report.

GLOBAL ECONOMy  3 

Global economy
Global economy

Global economic activity recovered strongly in 2021. In the United States, 
the recovery has been robust, and the economy is now experiencing excess 
demand and particularly elevated inflation. Other regions have also made 
important progress, although most are still operating somewhat below 
capacity.

Inflation has risen around the world and is projected to peak by the first 
quarter of 2022 in most regions. High energy and food prices, as well 
as strong demand for goods amid widespread supply shortages and 
bottlenecks, have driven inflation up. Supply shortages are expected to 
dissipate gradually by the end of 2022. However, significant uncertainties 
remain about the resolution of these shortages, and the Omicron variant may 
lead to more disruptions in the near term.

The recovery is expected to continue over the projection horizon, despite 
some near-term weakness because of the emergence of the Omicron variant. 
Global growth is projected to moderate from 6¾% in 2021 to about 3½% in 
2022 and 2023 (Table 1). The US economy is expected to continue growing 
at a robust pace, albeit with some moderation as policy support eases. 
Growth in China is expected to be restrained by weakness in the property 
sector and strict COVID-19 policies. Overall, the global growth outlook is 
weaker than it was in the October Report (Box 2).

Changes to the economic projection since the October Report
Global GDP outlook
Growth in China and emerging-market economies 
(EMEs) was a positive surprise for 2021. However, 
downward revisions to the outlook in most major regions 
over the projection horizon more than offset this growth. 
Overall, the level of global gross domestic product 
(GDP) has been revised down by 0.3% at the end of 
2023 relative to the October Report. The following 
factors explain the revisions to the outlook: 

in a lower estimate of GDP growth in 2021 by half a 
percentage point, to about 4½%.

GDP growth has been revised down by about a quarter 
of a percentage point in both 2022 and 2023, leaving the 
level of real GDP roughly ½  % lower at the end of 2023. 
The following factors explain the revisions to the outlook:

  The Omicron variant and related containment 

measures temporarily reduce economic activity in 
the fi rst quarter of 2022. 

  In response to the emergence of the Omicron 
variant of COVID-19, travel and public health 
restrictions are tighter than anticipated in all regions 
in early 2022. However, a large part of these effects 
should be temporary, and they are expected to 
dissipate in the second half of 2022 and in 2023.

  China’s outlook has been revised down, refl ecting a 
greater negative impact from the ongoing correction 
in the property sector.

  Monetary policy in the United States is expected to 
be less accommodative than previously anticipated 
because of the need to respond to higher-than-
expected infl ation.

Canadian GDP outlook
The level of GDP in Canada at the end of 2021 has 
been revised up due to stronger estimated growth in the 
fourth quarter. This improved forecast offsets historical 
data revisions that revealed a sharper contraction in the 
second quarter. Taken together, these revisions resulted 

  Recent data and fi scal updates from provincial 
and federal governments suggest that growth 
in government spending is easing earlier than 
expected.

  Supply constraints will have larger and more broad-

based negative implications on economic activity 
over 2022.

  The growth profi les for exports and business 

investment are revised down. This is due in part 
to the downward revision to the projection of US 
growth.

Canadian CPI infl ation outlook
Consumer price index (CPI) infl ation is expected to be 
higher than projected in October. The outlook for CPI 
infl ation in 2022 is revised up by about three-quarters of 
a percentage point to 4.2% and remains unchanged in 
2023 at 2.3%. This upward revision mainly refl ects 
larger impacts from various supply issues, notably those 
affecting shelter costs and food prices.

Some tightening of global financial conditions 
Government bond yields have risen in recent months in many countries, 
including Canada and the United States. This partly reflects market 
participants’ anticipation that policy interest rates will be raised earlier than 
previously expected. Despite this recent tightening, financial conditions 
remain broadly accommodative. Corporate bond spreads and the 
Can$/US$ exchange rate are close to their levels at the time of the October 
Report. However, global equity prices have recently declined owing to the 
combination of higher expected interest rates and increased geopolitical 
tensions. 

Recent strong growth to moderate in the United States 
Gross domestic product (GDP) growth rebounded at the end of 2021 after a 
period of soft activity associated with the spread of the Delta variant at the 
end of the summer. The labour market tightened considerably in the fourth 
quarter, as demonstrated by the decline in the unemployment rate and the

elevated number of job vacancies. Aggregate measures of wage growth have 
increased, particularly in industries that reopened quickly, such as leisure 
and hospitality.  

Bottlenecks at ports and global shortages of various goods will likely continue 
to curb production and push prices up. However, shipping costs seem to have 
plateaued, and some progress has been made on alleviating congestion at 
ports (Chart 1). Supply disruptions are anticipated to decline over 2022.
US GDP growth is projected to moderate from 5½% in 2021 to about 3¾% 
in 2022 and 2½% in 2023, as policy stimulus is withdrawn. Consumption is 
anticipated to remain solid in 2022 and 2023, supported by a strong labour 
market and households spending some of the savings they accumulated 
during the pandemic. The projection also incorporates the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law and other spending on research and development totalling 
US$1.5 trillion over eight years starting in 2022. 

Total and core measures of US personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) inflation remain high and are expected to peak at 5.7% and 5.0%, 
respectively, in the first quarter of 2022.1 Past increases in energy prices 
and continued supply bottlenecks amid high demand for goods have been 
important contributors to inflationary pressures (Chart 2). The effects of 
energy and supply shortages are anticipated to decline, gradually leading 
to a moderation in inflation over the course of the year. However, with 
the economy expected to remain in excess demand, PCE inflation is 
anticipated to stay above 2% over the projection horizon, reaching 2.4% 
at the end of 2023.

1  Total US consumer price index inflation is expected to peak at 7.1% in the first quarter.

Euro area recovery to continue amid new restrictions
Growth in the euro area is estimated to have slowed in late 2021, following 
the reintroduction of targeted restrictions in many countries in response to 
rising COVID-19 cases. The new wave of health and travel restrictions will 
likely be short-lived and the recovery is expected to continue, with growth 
gradually moderating in 2022 and 2023. 

Euro area inflation, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP), reached 5% in December. Most components of HICP have 
risen over the past year. However, a large part of the increase in inflation 
reflects high energy prices and past changes to the German value-added 
tax. Inflation is expected to ease over the projection horizon as the effects of 
these two factors dissipate.2 

Property sector weakness weighs on Chinese growth 
Growth in China is expected to slow to only 3¾% in 2022 as the property 
sector continues to adjust. Strict containment measures—particularly in 
light of the Omicron variant—continue to be a drag on the economy. Past 
tightening of regulations in the property sector has prompted a decline in 
housing activity that will likely be an important drag on growth in 2022. As a 
result, some property developers are experiencing financial distress. Other 
regulatory changes in a wide range of sectors, including technology and 
education, are also projected to weigh on domestic demand. 

In response to the economic slowdown, Chinese authorities have modestly 
increased policy support. Growth is projected to recover to about 5¼% in 
2023 as the drag on growth from the property sector diminishes. Uncertainty 
about both the impact of China’s “zero-COVID” policy and the fragility of the 
property sector remains high. Either of these factors could dampen growth by 
more than expected over the projection horizon.

2  Energy prices in the euro area could continue to rise in the near term due to geopolitical tensions.

Lower vaccination rates and policy tightening in 
emerging-market economies 
After a strong recovery in 2021, growth is expected to slow in 2022 and 2023 
in oil-importing EMEs and in the rest-of-the world group. Many countries have 
tightened monetary policy in response to increased inflationary pressures. 
Higher interest rates will weigh on economic activity, particularly in Latin 
America, Russia and emerging Europe. Growth in some EMEs may also 
be affected by low vaccination rates and renewed measures to contain 
COVID-19 outbreaks.

High and volatile commodity prices 
Oil prices have experienced significant volatility since the October Report 
(Chart 3). They initially fell sharply as the emergence of the Omicron 
variant increased uncertainty. With the economic impacts of Omicron now 
looking less severe than initially feared, prices have recovered. Concerns 
about global energy supply and heightened geopolitical tensions have also 
contributed to the rebound in oil prices. Over the projection horizon, the 
per-barrel prices of Brent, West Texas Intermediate and Western Canadian 
Select oil are assumed to be US$80, US$75 and US$65, respectively, the 
same levels as in the October Report (Box 1). 
Prices could stay above the flat oil price assumption if global energy 
shortages were to continue. Oil prices could also fall below this assumption if 
members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) 
and some non-OPEC oil producers, including the United States, were 
to significantly increase production. The severity and persistence of the 
Omicron variant also remains a downside risk.

Lumber prices have surged since the October Report, largely reflecting the 
combination of strong demand from the North American housing sector and 
floods in British Columbia that have hindered rail and road transportation. 
Prices of base metals and agricultural products are marginally stronger than 
in October. Markets expect these non-energy commodity prices to stay 
elevated over the projection horizon. This is because of reduced supply—
notably due to high energy input costs—and strong global demand.

Canadian economy

The Canadian economy experienced a strong rebound through the second 
half of 2021. Economic growth surged as the easing of public health 
measures boosted consumption of services, and exports bounced back due 
to growing foreign demand.  

The unexpected arrival of the highly infectious Omicron variant is causing 
renewed hardship for many. It also serves as a reminder that the evolution 
of the pandemic remains uncertain. The sharp increase in the number of 
cases and the imposition of related public health measures are slowing 
activity at the start of 2022, but robust growth should resume in the second 
quarter. The combination of high vaccination rates and improved adaptability 
of businesses and consumers limits the downside economic risks from this 
wave of the pandemic. 

Labour conditions are strong. The labour market had recovered to pre-
pandemic levels by the end of 2021. The employment rate has fully recovered 
when accounting for demographic change, firms are having difficulty finding 
workers, and wage growth is rising. Omicron is leading to some temporary 
job losses in hard-to-distance sectors and to a spike in worker absences 
more broadly, but these effects are expected to be short-lived. 

Faced with robust demand, many Canadian businesses are experiencing 
challenges due to supply constraints. Transportation bottlenecks, labour 
shortages and difficulty sourcing key inputs are resulting in reduced hours of 
operation, production slowdowns and delayed or cancelled sales. The overall 
effects of these supply disruptions are estimated to have been larger, broader 
and more persistent than initially anticipated. Exports and business investment 
have been particularly affected, as has consumer spending on some durable 
goods such as motor vehicles.   

The outlook is for strong growth over the projection horizon as demand 
remains robust and supply recovers from the effects of the pandemic, with 
disruptions expected to ease gradually through 2022. Overall, growth is 
forecast to be around 4% in 2022 and 3.5% in 2023, supported by household 
spending on services, exports and investment (Table 2). This growth forecast 
is slightly weaker than in the October Report (Box 2). 
Consumer price index (CPI) inflation is forecast to remain close to 5% over 
the first half of 2022. This is due to supply constraints coinciding with high 
energy prices and rising food costs. CPI inflation is anticipated to ease to 
about 3% by the end of 2022 as these pressures dissipate. Inflation is then 
expected to decline to around 2¼% by the second half of 2023 and remain 
close to the target in 2024.

Growth was robust in the second half of 2021, at around 5½%. It is expected 
to moderate to about 2% in the first quarter (Table 3 and Chart 4). The 
Omicron variant and its related supply disruptions are expected to temporarily 
weigh on hard-to-distance services such as travel and indoor dining, with the 
effects mitigated by governments extending their support programs. Elevated 
worker absences due to the rise in cases are anticipated to temporarily affect 
a broader range of industries. Strong growth is expected to resume later in 
the first quarter.

Supply constraints continue to weigh on spending and production. This 
can be seen, for example, in delays in the delivery of key inputs used by 
manufacturers (Chart 6). Despite these near-term challenges, solid foreign 
demand and improving business confidence should continue to support 
robust growth in business investment and exports. 

Labour markets tightened   
Employment growth has been robust in recent months. The unemployment 
rate is only 0.3 percentage points higher than it was in February 2020. 
Labour force participation rates are at or above pre-pandemic levels for most 
age groups, and job postings are at near-record levels. The Omicron wave 
is weighing temporarily on employment in hard-to-distance sectors. The 
expected short duration of restrictions should limit the impact on the labour 
market.

In the Bank’s Business Outlook Survey (BOS) for the fourth quarter of 2021, 
about 40% of firms reported that labour shortages are restricting their ability 
to meet demand—a level not seen since 2007. Moreover, most of these firms 
expect the shortages to persist until at least 2023.

Wage growth is picking up, partly due to the need to attract employees 
(Chart 7). Given a greater number of job openings, many workers can more 
easily find higher-paying jobs that better fit their skills, and this should boost 
productivity.

Note: JVWS is the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey; LFS is the Labour Force Survey; SEPH is the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours. Due to data limitations 
at the onset of the pandemic, JVWS job vacancies data are unavailable for the middle quarters of 2020. The LFS principal component measure is calculated using 
the estimated common trend of annual growth for wages based on employees’ job status (full or part time), job permanency (permanent or temporary), industry of 
employment and occupation. The national accounts wage measure is constructed as total wages and salaries at a monthly frequency from the Canadian System of 
Macroeconomic Accounts divided by total hours worked from SEPH.

Labour productivity growth has been weak amid broader labour market gains. 
Supply shortages, restrictions on the number of customers being served and 
slack in hard-to-distance services, such as travel, are likely contributing to 
this weakness. As pandemic-related supply disruptions abate and business 
investment strengthens, labour productivity growth should increase.  

Economic slack absorbed
The absorption of economic slack in the second half of 2021 was faster than 
expected in the October Report. At that time, output and employment growth 
were projected to be strong, but the recovery has been even more robust. 
This is due to a surge in services consumption, strong growth in exports 
and the addition of almost 800,000 jobs since May. At the same time, supply 
has been revised down since October because of further bottlenecks and 
shortages related to the pandemic (Chart 8 and Box 1). Businesses have 
also reported that they increasingly face capacity constraints as they try to 
meet elevated demand. 

Consequently, a broad set of measures—including labour market indicators, 
surveys on business sentiment and measures of core inflation—suggest that 
economic slack is now absorbed (Box 3). Taking the respective demand 
and supply pressures into account, the Bank estimates that the output gap 
narrowed to between -0.75% and 0.25% in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Economic slack in the fourth quarter of 2021
Estimates of the degree of slack in the overall economy 
are inherently uncertain. This is particularly true 
given the signifi cant and unprecedented disruptions 
to supply and demand brought on by the pandemic. 
Consequently, a wide range of measures and indicators 
should be considered when estimating slack. These 
include the state of the labour market, responses to

such as the employment, participation and unemployment 
rates are close to their pre-pandemic levels.1 The job 
vacancy rate is near a series high, suggesting that labour 
market conditions are tight. Measures of inclusiveness 
have also improved with the return of employment

high. 

  Some measures of year-over-year wage growth 

have not quite fully rebounded.  

Business capacity pressures
Canadian businesses across a wide range of sectors 
report that they are facing capacity constraints. The 
fourth-quarter 2021 Business Outlook Survey shows that 
more than three-quarters of respondents would have 
diffi culty meeting an unexpected increase in demand—a 
survey high (Chart 3-B). In many cases, labour 
shortages are contributing to these capacity constraints. 
Private sector surveys show similar results. While survey 
respondents continue to point to supply disruptions as 
playing an important role, many businesses also cite 
strong demand. Capacity pressures are being reported 
not only by businesses that have seen their revenues 
grow over the course of the pandemic but also by those 
that have not.  

Measures of core infl ation 
Rates of core infl ation also suggest that economic slack 
is absorbed. In normal circumstances, core infl ation 
staying persistently at 2% would be consistent with no 
economic slack. The Bank’s three preferred measures 
of core infl ation—CPI-common, CPI-median and CPI-
trim—currently sit at 2.1%, 3.0% and 3.7%, respectively. 
The price distortions caused by the pandemic make 
it more diffi cult to use measures of core infl ation as a 
proxy for slack. For example, the impact of supply chain 
disruptions abroad may be pushing up CPI-trim and 
CPI-median; as a result, there may appear to be more 
excess demand in the domestic economy than there 

1  The labour market at the end of 2019 can be characterized as having had no 

slack.

actually is. CPI-common, which puts more weight on 
services and consequently on domestic conditions, has 
also been affected. Nevertheless, all three measures 
have moved up over the past year to above 2%, 
suggesting that the economy is at full capacity. 

Output gap
Estimates of the output gap bring together the Bank’s 
assessment of both labour market slack and how labour 
productivity differs from its trend. While labour market slack 
is absorbed, supply disruptions and pandemic-related 
restrictions have weighed on labour productivity. Moreover, 
investment has been weak since the beginning of 2020.

The Bank takes these factors, as well as the latest 
upward revision to quarterly growth at the end of 2021, 
into account when estimating the output gap. The Bank 
estimates the output gap—the difference between gross 
domestic product and supply—to be between -0.75% 
and 0.25% in the fourth quarter of 2021. It is important to 
note that the complexity of recovery makes estimates of 
the output gap more uncertain than normal.

Assessment of economic slack
The job market is tight, businesses face historically high 
capacity constraints, and measures of core infl ation are 
above 2%. The Bank’s estimate of the economy-wide 
output gap is consistent with these indicators. Taken 
together, these factors support the Bank’s assessment 
that, overall, slack is absorbed in Canada.

Durable goods prices are being pushed up by global supply chain 
disruptions, while Canadian energy prices are higher because of elevated 
global oil and natural gas prices. At the same time, last year’s drought and 
ongoing supply challenges are contributing to higher food prices (Box 4). The 
result is that goods price inflation has reached nearly 7%, well above the 
previous 10-year average of roughly 1% (Chart 10). Taken together, energy 
prices and components subject to supply constraints are currently adding 
nearly 4 percentage points to inflation. 

Box 4

Upward pressure on food prices to persist
As consumers face rising prices at grocery stores, 
food price infl ation is making headlines. Prices for food 
purchased in stores are up nearly 6% year over year 
(Chart 4-A).
Food categories with the strongest price infl ation 
include:1

  beef, bacon and chicken—up 12%, 19% and 6%, 

respectively 

  breakfast cereals, prepared fruits and prepared 

vegetables—up about 6%

  potato chips and other snacks and margarine—up 

about 7% and 18%, respectively

Several factors contribute to this recent increase in food 
prices. 

First, domestic prices for agricultural commodities, 
which closely follow global prices, have recently 
increased signifi cantly (Chart 4-B). This is due to 
unfavourable weather conditions in many growing areas 
of the world, including the drought in Western Canada. 
Because producing livestock and many processed foods 
requires these agricultural commodities, the higher input 
costs are passed along to consumers.

Second, supply chain disruptions have adversely 
affected food processors’ productivity and unit costs. In 
addition, food processors have slowed production lines 
to implement health measures to protect their workers. 

Third, higher energy costs are putting upward pressure 
on distribution costs. These and other such cost 
increases are contributing to, for example, the recent 
administrative increase in milk prices paid to farmers. 

These increases in food prices will likely continue. As 
a result, the Bank of Canada expects that food price 
infl ation will be above its historical average over 2022.

Services price inflation, which is affected by both domestic and external 
forces, has risen to nearly 3.5%. The increase is led by escalating 
construction costs due to higher prices for building materials and labour 
shortages. As a result of these factors, price pressures have broadened 
across CPI components (Chart 10). Close to 55% of CPI components are 
now growing at more than 3%, well above the historical average of 30%.   

Core measures of inflation have edged higher since October, with CPI-trim 
and CPI-median at 3.7% and 3.0%, respectively (Chart 11). CPI-common 
has remained more muted at 2.1% because it attaches less importance to 
some components that have seen the largest price changes, such as motor 
vehicles. In contrast, some components with high weights—such as local 
transportation and health care goods—have experienced less intense price 
pressures.

CANADIAN ECONOMy  19 

Strong growth over the projection horizon 
Economic growth is projected to be robust and more balanced, averaging 
3¾% over 2022 and 2023, supported by strong domestic and foreign 
demand (Table 2). As supply shortages ease and COVID-19 restrictions are 
removed, GDP will grow faster than employment, and output per worker will 
rise. Together with robust business investment and higher immigration, this 
increase in labour productivity will increase supply growth and should support 
economic growth without putting additional pressure on inflation. 

Consumption-led recovery
Consumption growth is forecast to be strong over the projection horizon, 
supported by job gains (Chart 12). Consumption should also be boosted by 
improving confidence and some spending of accumulated savings. 

Beyond the first quarter of 2022, spending on hard-to-distance services is 
expected to increase further as cautiousness around the pandemic fades. 
Purchases that have been delayed—for goods such as motor vehicles and 
appliances—will also increase as supply disruptions ease. 

Housing market activity is anticipated to remain elevated but ease from its 
current levels. Resales should be dampened by the fading of the pandemic-
induced boost in demand, reduced support from accumulated savings, and 
borrowing rates that are now above their pandemic lows. Meanwhile, the 
easing of supply chain disruptions should support residential construction 
over 2022. The resulting growth in supply combined with easing demand 
should help rebalance housing markets and contribute to a moderation in 
house price growth.

Foreign demand to support solid export growth
Export growth is projected to be robust in 2022, boosted by solid foreign 
demand and elevated commodity prices (Chart 13). It then moderates, 
along with US growth, in 2023. Goods exports, excluding energy, will also be 
supported by the dissipation of global supply disruptions. 

Services exports are anticipated to strengthen as international travel 
recovers. The recovery is expected to take time given the slow return of 
international tourism. Over the long term, the overall level of international 
travel may also be negatively affected by new ways of working and efforts to 
address climate change. 

Relatively high prices for oil and natural gas are projected to support energy 
exports. Growth in energy exports is expected to be strong in 2022. It then 
eases in 2023 as expansions of oil sands production slow. With the addition 
of the Trans Mountain Expansion, transportation capacity should be sufficient 
to accommodate rising oil exports for several years.

As supply chain issues ease, strong domestic demand and firms’ desire to 
invest and rebuild inventories should support the recovery in goods imports.

Business investment to strengthen
Robust business investment is expected after a period of pandemic-related 
weakness (Chart 14). Outside the oil and gas sector, firms are expected 
to increase their investment in the face of growing domestic and foreign 
demand, improved business confidence, limited production capacity and the 
gradual easing of supply constraints. The BOS for the fourth quarter of 2021 
revealed broad-based strength in investment intentions.

Investment in the oil and gas sector is anticipated to increase but remain 
below pre-pandemic levels. Despite relatively elevated price levels, long-term 
investments, such as those in the oil sands, will likely remain subdued given 
high uncertainty about future demand. In contrast, shorter-term investments, 
such as conventional oil and gas wells, are expected to rise.

Inventory investment is projected to contribute to growth as businesses 
rebuild their inventories following unprecedented drawdowns in 2020 and 
ongoing delivery delays.

CPI inflation to decline in the second half of this year
As pandemic-related forces fade, inflation is forecast to ease over the second 
half of 2022 and into early 2023 (Chart 15). Upward pressure from supply 
shortages is expected to diminish over 2022. Under the assumption that oil 
prices remain flat, the boost from higher gasoline prices should also fade in 
the coming quarters. This expected easing can be seen in the evolution of 
annualized quarter-over-quarter inflation rates, which fall from around 4¾% 
in the first quarter of 2022 to about 2¼% by the fourth quarter of 2022. Year-
over-year inflation is projected to decline from about 5% in early 2022 to 
about 3% by the end of 2022 as these pressures dissipate. Inflation is then 
expected to decline to around 2¼% by the second half of 2023 and remain 
close to the target in 2024.

Businesses and consumers view price pressures as elevated over the next 
two years. Most respondents to both the BOS and the Canadian Survey of 
Consumer Expectations for the fourth quarter of 2021 anticipate inflation to 
be above 3% on average over the next two years. 

Despite this rise in expected inflation, longer-term inflation expectations remain 
well anchored (Chart 16). Most firms that responded to the recent BOS expect 
inflation to return close to the 2% target in one to three years. 

Private sector forecasters have increased their expectations for inflation over 
the next year, but their longer-term expectations have remained stable. The 
October 2021 Consensus Economics forecast continues to show an average 
of 2% over the next 10 years. In addition, while the 5- and 10-year Canadian 
break-even inflation rates are now somewhat above pre-pandemic levels, 
they are well aligned with the 2% inflation target.

Canada’s balance sheet
Canada’s balance sheet

In November 2021, in light of the progress made in the economic recovery, 
the Bank ended its program of quantitative easing (QE) and entered the 
reinvestment phase. In this phase, the Bank purchases Government of 
Canada bonds solely to replace maturing bonds and maintain the stimulus 
provided by previous QE purchases. At present, this requires approximately 
$4 billion to $5 billion in purchases per month (or about $1 billion per week) 
across both the primary and secondary markets (Chart 17). These purchases 
keep the Bank’s holdings of Government of Canada bonds roughly constant 
at around $435 billion. This amount currently represents 87% of the Bank’s 
total assets. The rest of the balance sheet largely reflects assets acquired 
early in the pandemic to keep markets functioning. Most of the assets 
acquired then have already matured and rolled off the Bank’s balance sheet, 
and the remainder will do so over time.

RISKS tO tHE INFLAtION OUtLOOK  24 

Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook

Uncertainty around the projection remains unusually high. The outlook 
continues to depend on how the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, most notably 
the spread of variants. The pandemic will continue to weigh on confidence 
and disrupt supply for some time, posing both upward and downward risks to 
inflation. While high vaccination rates in Canada have diminished the likelihood 
of a severe downturn, the reopening of the economy remains complex. 
Pervasive supply constraints will need to unwind. Moreover, the work routines 
and spending habits of households are shifting. Consequently, the evolution of 
supply and demand and its effects on inflation are particularly uncertain.

Some of the risks identified in previous reports have been partially 
incorporated into the projection. For example, the base-case scenario 
includes a short-lived negative impact from the Omicron variant as well as 
more widespread inflationary pressures from supply-side disruptions.

While the upside and downside risks to the Bank’s inflation projection are 
viewed as roughly balanced, the upside risks are of greater concern. Until 
inflation moves significantly lower, there is an elevated risk that Canadians 
will start to believe that inflation will stay high over the long term. Higher 
inflation expectations could in turn lead to more pervasive labour costs and 
inflationary pressures and could become embedded in ongoing inflation.

Drawing from a larger set of risks, this section presents a selection of those 
identified as most important for the projected path of inflation.

(i)  More persistent effects of the pandemic on confidence (↓)
The emergence of the Omicron variant is a reminder that the evolution 
of the pandemic remains uncertain. The pandemic’s effects on 
business sentiment, household confidence and economic activity may 
be more severe and persistent than assumed in the projection. For 
instance, COVID-19 variants could induce a longer-lasting drag on 
confidence and delay the recovery in hard-to-distance service sectors.

(ii)  More persistent supply bottlenecks and cost pressures (↑)
The spread of COVID-19 variants could further disrupt manufacturing and 
shipping activities, causing longer-lasting shortages of goods and labour. 
It could also delay the rebalancing of consumption from goods to services. 
A continued preference for goods consumption would exacerbate 
congestion in already stretched supply chains. Moreover, repeated 
disruptions to business operations may lead firms to adjust their supply 
chains in ways that could increase costs. More persistent labour shortages 
could also result in greater wage pressures. Taken together, these effects 
would lead to more persistent inflationary pressures.

RISKS tO tHE INFLAtION OUtLOOK  25 

(iii)  Reversal of growth in goods prices (↓)

Pandemic-induced shifts in consumption patterns and disruptions in 
supply have pushed prices of goods higher. The base-case scenario 
assumes that these price increases faced by consumers do not 
reverse. However, the rebalancing of consumption from goods to 
services could occur faster than assumed in the projection. Combined 
with an expansion of transportation capacity and efforts to improve 
logistics, these developments could resolve supply chain disruptions 
faster than expected and cause some prices to decline. If this 
occurred, inflation would be weaker than projected. For example, in a 
scenario with a 30% reversal of these pandemic-induced effects on 
prices, inflation falls more quickly, declining to slightly below 2% in 
2023.

(iv)  Stronger household spending in Canada (↑)

The projection continues to include some degree of caution around 
consumption. However, over time, a reduction in pandemic-related 
uncertainty could boost confidence by more than expected. 
Consequently, households could spend more of their accumulated 
savings. Consumption and residential investment would then be 
stronger than projected and would contribute to greater inflationary 
pressures.

(v)  Sharp deterioration of global economic and financial 

conditions (↓)
With high levels of global indebtedness and elevated equity valuations, 
a pullback in risk appetite could trigger a sharp tightening of global 
financial conditions. Increased inflationary pressures and the 
associated uncertainty surrounding how soon advanced economies 
will reduce monetary policy stimulus could trigger capital outflows, 
especially from some EMEs. Such outflows would create financial 
stress, leading to slower growth. In addition, efforts by Chinese 
authorities to address vulnerabilities and engineer a soft landing in the 
property sector could weigh on growth more than expected. These 
shocks could have negative spillover effects on the global economy 
and would be transmitted to the Canadian economy through weaker 
exports, lower commodity prices and a deterioration in the terms of 
trade.

Canada’s infl ation‑control strategy
Canada’s infl ation‑control strategy1
Infl ation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote the 

economic and fi nancial well-being of Canadians.

  Canada’s experience with infl ation targeting since 1991 has shown 
that the best way to foster confi dence in the value of money and to 
contribute to sustained economic growth, employment gains and 
improved living standards is by keeping infl ation low, stable and 
predictable.

 

In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 
Canada’s infl ation-control target for a further fi ve-year period, ending 
December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the rate of infl ation 
of the consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 percent midpoint 
of the control range of 1 to 3 percent.

Monetary policy tools
  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight 

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent 

communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the 
economy and infl ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on 
eight pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s 
outlook are published four times each year in the Monetary Policy 
Report.

Infl ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible
  Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means 
that the Bank is equally concerned about infl ation rising above or 
falling below the 2 percent target.

  Canada’s infl ation-targeting framework is ﬂ exible. Typically, the 

Bank seeks to return infl ation to target over a horizon of six to eight 
quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning 
infl ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence 
of the shocks buffeting the economy.

quarters—to work their way through the economy and have their 
full effect on infl ation. For this reason, monetary policy must be 
forward-looking.

Monitoring infl ation
 

  The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes in 

the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate).2 The Bank 
also has a range of other monetary policy tools it can use when the 
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on 
the future evolution of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases 
(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures, 
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these 
additional tools would depend on the economic and fi nancial market 
context.

  All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for 

Canadian goods and services through their infl uence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The 
balance between this demand and the economy’s production 
capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl ation 
pressures in the economy.

In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in 
indirect taxes such as the goods and services tax/harmonized sales 
tax, can cause sizable fl uctuations in CPI infl ation.

 

In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such 
transitory movements in CPI infl ation and focuses on a set of “core” 
infl ation measures that better refl ect the underlying trend of infl ation. 
In this sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the 
Bank achieve the CPI infl ation target. They are not a replacement for 
CPI infl ation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl ation are CPI-trim, 
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given 
month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which corresponds to 
the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket 
weight) of the distribution of price changes; and CPI-common, which 
uses a statistical procedure to track common price changes across 
categories in the CPI basket.

Inﬂ ation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

Overview
Overview

Confidence in the economic recovery in Canada and other major economies 
has improved. However, COVID-19 variants are leading to renewed 
lockdowns in many countries, dampening near-term activity.

Economic activity in recent months has been more resilient than anticipated, 
with consumers and businesses learning new ways to adapt to public health 
measures. The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines is also progressing faster in 
some jurisdictions than previously expected (Chart 1, Box 1). Governments, 
most importantly in the United States, have announced new fiscal stimulus. 
Overall, the outlook has been revised up for the Canadian and global 
economies.

Achieving full recovery will take time, and the impacts of the pandemic 
remain uneven. As well, uncertainty remains elevated, particularly around the 
implications of variants of the virus. In this context, fiscal and monetary policy 
are providing important support to economic activity in Canada and globally.

Key messages
  The Canadian economy showed impressive resilience during the second 

wave of the pandemic, and estimates of growth in the first quarter have 
been revised up significantly.

  Nevertheless, many Canadians remain out of work, particularly low-wage 

workers, young people and women. Although recent job numbers have 
been encouraging, it may take considerable time for overall employment to 
recover. 

  The current resurgence of the virus presents a new setback. Health care 

systems are under strain, and workers in hard-to-distance sectors will bear 
the brunt of the new restrictions. The economic impact of the third wave is 
expected to be material but temporary. Without the adaptation seen in the 
second wave and the increasing number of people vaccinated, the effects 
of the third wave would be more severe and long lasting.

  With the greater resilience of the Canadian and global economies, 

progress on vaccinations, continued fiscal and monetary policy support, 
and higher commodity prices, the overall Canadian outlook has been 
revised up from the January Report.

  In light of the stronger outlook and increased digitalization, the Bank now 

estimates that the pandemic will be less detrimental to the economy’s 
potential output than previously assessed. 

  In the near term, inflation is expected to rise temporarily to around the top 
of the 1 to 3 percent inflation-control target range, largely reflecting base-
year effects and gasoline price dynamics. The Bank tends to look through 
such temporary movements. 

  In view of the more favourable economic outlook, the Bank now expects 
slack will be absorbed and inflation will sustainably return to target some 
time in the second half of 2022. This timing is more uncertain than usual, 
however, given the uncertainty around potential output and the highly 
uneven impacts of the pandemic.

Key inputs to the projection
The Bank of Canada’s projection is always conditional 
on several key assumptions, and changes to them will 
affect the outlook for the Canadian economy. The Bank 
regularly reviews these assumptions and assesses the 
sensitivity of the economic projection to them. The key 
inputs into the Bank’s projection are as follows:

  The global vaccination rollout is progressing. Broad 

immunity is assumed to be achieved by mid-2021 
in the United States; later in 2021 in Canada, other 
advanced economies and China; and in 2022 in 
other emerging-market economies.

  The more stringent restrictions imposed in Canada 

in response to the spike in COVID-19 cases near 
the end of the ﬁ rst quarter and at the start of the 
second quarter are assumed to begin easing by 
the end of May. Consumer caution is expected to 
diminish gradually through the latter part of the 
year. Nonetheless, some caution continues over the 
rest of the projection horizon.

  The projection incorporates $85 billion in federal 
ﬁ scal stimulus, the midpoint of the $70 billion to 
$100 billion range announced in the Fall Economic 
Statement 2020. In January, ﬁ scal stimulus was 
assumed to be $70 billion, the lower end of the 
announced range.

  Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent levels. 

The per-barrel prices in US dollars are assumed to 
be $65 for Brent, $60 for West Texas Intermediate 
and $50 for Western Canadian Select, about $15, 
$10 and $15 higher, respectively, than assumed in 
the January Report.

  By convention, the Bank does not forecast the 

exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. The 
Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at 80 cents 
US over the projection horizon, close to its recent 
average and higher than the 78 cents US assumed 
in the January Report.

  The pandemic and related containment measures 

have both lasting and temporary negative effects on 
the Canadian economy.1
  The Bank’s assessment of potential output 

growth, a longer-term concept, looks through 
the short-lived impacts of containment 

1  As in the previous three reports, the Bank makes the distinction between 
supply and potential output in the near term to account for the relatively 
short-lived nature of some of the decrease in supply.

measures. Over 2021–23, potential output 
growth is estimated to average about 
1.6 percent per year, about 0.5 percentage 
points higher than estimated in October 2020 
(Appendix 1). This change reﬂ ects stronger 
expected investment—including in automation 
and digitalization—and reduced scarring effects 
from the pandemic.

  Containment measures implemented by 

governments have been having signiﬁ cant 
short-term effects on the supply of goods and 
services. In particular, supply fell sharply in 
early 2020 when some businesses were forced 
to temporarily suspend or reduce operations. 
The estimated size of the effects of containment 
measures on supply has been revised down in 
the second half of 2020 and into 2021. These 
effects are expected to dissipate by the end of 
the year.

  Estimates of supply can be obtained by 

combining the estimates of the temporary 
effects of the containment measures with the 
assessment of potential output. The Bank 
estimates that growth in real gross domestic 
product (GDP) exceeded that of revised supply 
in the ﬁ rst quarter. As a result, the output gap—
the difference between GDP and supply—was 
about -3.0 to -2.0 percent in the ﬁ rst quarter 
of 2021, somewhat narrower than the revised 
range of -4.25 to -3.25 percent in the fourth 
quarter.

  The neutral nominal interest rate is deﬁ ned as 
the real rate consistent with output remaining 
sustainably at its potential and with inﬂ ation at 
target, on an ongoing basis, plus 2 percent for 
inﬂ ation. It is a medium- to long-term equilibrium 
concept. For this Report, the Bank reassessed 
its estimate of the neutral interest rate, but the 
estimated range remains at 1.75 to 2.75 percent.2 
The economic projection is based on an 
assumption that the neutral rate is at the midpoint 
of this range.

Global economy

The global economy has been more resilient to the pandemic than previously 
assessed, and the global outlook is revised up from the January Report 
(Box 2). Global economic activity is set to ramp up in mid-2021, as policy 
support and the expansion of vaccination programs enable stronger growth, 
notably in service sectors. Currently, however, the spread of new COVID-19 
variants and the renewal of lockdowns, together with challenges to supply 
chains, are weighing on activity in many economies.

The pace of the economic recovery varies considerably across countries. 
In the United States, exceptionally large, front-loaded fiscal stimulus and 
rapid vaccination rollouts are expected to lift growth to 7 percent in 2021. In 
most other regions, recovery is slower than in the United States. Overall, the 
Bank projects global growth in gross domestic product (GDP) to surge to 
6.8 percent in 2021, after contracting by 2.4 percent in 2020 (Table 1). The 
projected rate of global growth then moderates to about 4 percent in 2022, as 
the rebound in activity eases and the effects of fiscal stimulus fade.

The global recovery has sparked an increase in commodity prices. Recent 
increases in energy prices are raising inflation in several countries. Base-
year effects are also expected to boost inflation in the coming months. These 
effects are caused by sharp declines in some prices a year ago. US inflation 
is anticipated to average more than 2 percent over the projection horizon as a 
result of these transitory factors as well as inflationary pressures arising from 
the rapid US recovery.

Box 2

Changes to the global projection since the January Report 
The global outlook is considerably stronger than it 
was in the January Report. The level of global gross 
domestic product (GDP) is revised up by 1.6 percent 
in 2021 and remains 0.5 percent higher in 2023. Key 
factors behind the revisions include the following:

US$900 billion announced in December 2020 was 
deployed more quickly than expected. As well, by 
the end of 2021, the American Rescue Plan (ARP) is 
expected to raise US GDP by 2.4 percent and global 
GDP by about 0.5 percent. 

  Stronger-than-expected data in the fourth quarter of 

2020 and the fi rst quarter of 2021 have raised the 
forecast for GDP in almost all regions. This is seen 
especially in the emerging-market-economy and 
rest-of-the-world groupings. Overall, global GDP in 
the fi rst quarter of 2021 is 1.3 percent higher than in 
the January Report.

  More fi scal stimulus has boosted US and global 

output. In the United States, the fi scal stimulus of 

US personal consumption expenditure infl ation was 
higher than expected in recent months. As a result, 
it is now estimated to be 1.7 percent in the fi rst 
quarter—0.5 percentage points higher than forecast 
in the January Report. In addition, stronger growth 
associated with the ARP is expected to raise US 
infl ation by as much as 0.3 percentage points. This will 
bring it to 2.4 percent by the end of 2023.

Oil prices considerably higher
Stronger global demand prospects, together with supply restraints, have 
driven oil prices considerably higher since the January Report. The prices 
of Brent, West Texas Intermediate and Western Canadian Select oil are 
US$10 to US$15 higher than assumed in January (Box 1).
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus several other 
major oil-exporting countries (OPEC+) extended most of their previous 
production cuts through April and agreed to gradually increase output starting 
in May. Supply increases by US producers have been limited, despite the 
rise in oil prices in recent months. Levels of spare capacity remain very high 
(Chart 2). 
In the near term, risks to the assumption of flat oil prices are mostly to the 
upside since the demand for oil could rise faster than the supply as global 
growth picks up. Over the projection horizon, however, this risk is roughly 
balanced by the risk that a rapid return of previously idled capacity to 
production could reduce oil prices.

The Bank’s non-energy commodity price index has risen 11 percent since 
the January Report. Strong housing demand in North America has pushed 
already-elevated lumber prices up about 35 percent—to record highs. Base 
metals have seen a 7 percent increase, partly reflecting prospects for higher 
global growth.

Bond yields higher with improved global outlook
Nominal yields on benchmark US 10-year bonds have risen about 50 basis 
points since the January Report. Market-based measures of US inflation 
expectations have been rising for several months. Since January, US real 
yields have moved up in response to improved growth prospects, and 
they account for over one-half of the total increase in the US 10-year yield. 
However, real 10-year yields still remain negative and close to historical 
lows. Sovereign bond yields for other economies, including Canada, have 
also increased since the January Report, as financial markets responded to 
improved growth prospects (Chart 3).
Risk appetite has remained relatively robust, contributing to accommodative 
financial conditions. Equity price indexes in most advanced economies have 
increased since January and remain near recent highs. Corporate credit 
spreads have narrowed considerably since the onset of the pandemic and, 
as in January, are close to their pre-pandemic levels. Some emerging-market 
economies (EMEs), however, have faced tighter financial conditions in recent 
months.

The US dollar has strengthened against the currencies of most US trading 
partners since the January Report, and the Canadian dollar has appreciated 
by about 1 percent against the US dollar. Higher oil and other commodity 
prices have contributed to the recent rise in the Canadian dollar.

Substantial fiscal stimulus boosting growth in the 
United States
The US$900 billion fiscal package announced by the United States in 
December last year boosted incomes and consumption in early 2021 
(Chart 4). The US$1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan (ARP) approved in 
March provides substantial additional fiscal support, primarily through 
government spending and transfers to households. Now that most cheques 
have already been sent out, the Bank expects US growth could reach about 
10 percent annualized in the second quarter. 

Progress on COVID-19 vaccinations is leading to the easing of containment 
measures, boosting confidence and supporting growth (Chart 1). The rapid 
vaccination rollout is also expected to help limit the scarring effects on the 
level of potential GDP (Appendix 1).
Overall, the Bank projects US GDP to grow by 7 percent in 2021. 
Consumption—including demand for high-contact services—is driving 
most of the growth as the economy reopens and fiscal transfers continue 
to provide income support. Robust demand, ARP stimulus and low interest 
rates are also expected to boost growth in business and housing investment. 
These components are important sources of demand for Canadian exports. 
In 2022, US GDP growth moderates to about 4 percent as the effects of fiscal 
policy fade. Since fiscal policy is front loaded, its contribution to GDP growth 
is negative in 2023, and growth slows to 1.3 percent.

US personal consumption expenditure inflation is expected to rise to close to 
3 percent in the near term, reflecting increases in energy prices, health care 
fees, shelter costs and base-year effects. Rapid output growth is expected to 
absorb slack and create excess demand. This will keep inflation somewhat 
above 2 percent through 2023, consistent with the US Federal Reserve’s 
average inflation targeting strategy.

Additional lockdowns to constrain euro area recovery
The spread of new COVID-19 variants in the euro area has led to additional 
lockdowns and has likely contributed to negative GDP growth in the first 
quarter. Disruptions from semiconductor shortages may also constrain near-
term activity. In response to these developments, several governments 
have provided further fiscal support. Growth is projected to pick up in mid-
2021, as COVID-19 vaccinations roll out, lockdowns ease and policy support 
continues. Fiscal stimulus starts to wind down in 2022, creating a drag 
on growth. Currently, base-year effects and other factors are temporarily 
boosting inflation in the euro area. Persistent economic slack and subdued 
inflation expectations, however, are expected to keep inflation below 
1.5 percent over the medium term.

Growth to moderate in China and emerging markets
After strong growth in late 2020, economic activity in China slowed in early 
2021, due partly to renewed pandemic containment measures in some areas. 
Chinese exports continue to benefit from strong global demand for goods, 
although domestic consumption growth remains moderate. Broadening 
COVID-19 immunity should provide some support to growth in 2021. But the 
impact will likely be muted compared with other regions, since the virus is 
already well controlled and activity is less restrained in China. Policy support 
is expected to be withdrawn gradually. The Bank projects China’s economy 
to grow by 911/22 percent in 2021 and then to expand roughly in line with the 
Bank’s estimate of Chinese potential output growth in 2022 and 2023.

The oil-importing EME group experienced robust, double-digit growth at the 
end of 2020. Growth is moderating in early 2021 as several EMEs require 
renewed restrictions to slow rapidly spreading COVID-19 variants. Some 

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONEtARy POlICy REPORt  •  APRIl 2021

EMEs have recently tightened monetary policy because their depreciating 
currencies were contributing to rising inflation. Growth for the EME group 
is projected to slow in 2022 and 2023 when initial rebound effects will have 
faded. Slow vaccination rollouts are expected to restrain the recovery through 
2023.

In the rest-of-the-world group, activity has been quite resilient despite 
some recent pandemic-related lockdowns. GDP growth is forecast to pick 
up in mid-2021 as economies reopen and recent increases in oil prices 
provide a tailwind to growth for oil exporters. Growth is anticipated to slow in 
2022 and 2023 as activity normalizes and policy support recedes.

The Canadian economy continues to recover from the pandemic’s 
devastating effects. Economic activity proved much more resilient during the 
second wave, reflecting the ability of consumers to adapt and ingenuity on 
the part of businesses to function under restrictions. As a result, growth is 
estimated to be significantly higher in the first quarter of 2021 than anticipated 
in the January Report.

Even as new containment restrictions will restrain growth in the near term, 
the rollout of vaccines, fiscal and monetary policy support, strong foreign 
demand and higher commodity prices should contribute to robust growth in 
2021 (Chart 5). Nevertheless, considerable uncertainty remains concerning 
the evolution of the pandemic, particularly given the rapid spread of more 
contagious variants of the virus.

Achieving full recovery will take time. Strong and sustained growth is needed 
to overcome the pandemic’s severe economic impacts. A significant amount 
of economic slack remains in high-contact service sectors, where workers 
and businesses have suffered the most. Moreover, the situations in these 
sectors will worsen before they get better because many provinces are 
seeing rising infection rates and are tightening public health restrictions.

Changes to the Canadian projection since the January Report
The profi le for gross domestic product (GDP) is higher 
than projected in the January Report (Chart 3-A). GDP 
growth is revised up by 2½ percentage points in 2021, to 
about 6½ percent (Table 2). As a result, the level of real 
GDP is about 2½ percent higher in 2021, 1½ percent 
higher in 2022 and 2 percent higher in 2023. Domestic 
and foreign data have been stronger than anticipated—
notably for Canadian housing and employment.

Chart 3-A: 
Seasonally adjusted at annual rates, chained 2012 dollars, quarterly data

The forecast for Canadian GDP has been revised up

  GDP growth has been revised up by about 

9½ percentage points in the fi rst quarter of 2021 and 
is now expected to be around 7 percent (Table 3). 
Growth in the second quarter is forecast to be about 
3½ percent, leaving the level of GDP at the end of 
the quarter about 2½ percent higher than previously 
estimated.

  Improved terms of trade, higher potential output and 

additional fi scal stimulus, combined with an earlier 
recovery of consumer confi dence, will contribute to 
stronger projected domestic demand. 

  Stronger foreign demand, higher commodity prices 

and improved business confi dence lead to higher 
expected levels of exports and investment than in 
the January Report. 

Compared with the January Report, consumer price 
index (CPI) infl ation is revised up by 0.7 percentage 
points in 2021 and by 0.2 percentage points in 2022

and 2023. CPI infl ation has been stronger than expected 
in recent months, partly refl ecting higher oil prices. 
This source of additional infl ationary strength continues 
throughout 2021. The upward revisions for 2022 and 
2023 mostly refl ect the improved outlook.

Over the medium term, consumption should recover strongly when 
restrictions ease and jobs are recouped. Progress toward broad immunity, 
domestically and globally, will also help reduce uncertainty and improve 
household and business confidence. This in turn will support business 
investment and exports. As a result, the recovery is expected to become 
more broad-based. 

Overall, the outlook is stronger than in the January Report (Box 3). Economic 
activity is now forecast to grow at a robust pace of around 6½ percent in 
2021. GDP growth is projected to then moderate to around 3¾ percent in 
2022 and around 3¼ percent in 2023 (Table 2).
Considerable uncertainty surrounds the medium-term outlook for GDP and 
potential output. Many issues remain unclear, including the persistence of 
changes in consumer preferences, the extent of labour market scarring, the 
implications of weak investment early in the pandemic and the productivity 
benefits of faster deployment of new digital technologies. Because these 
factors tend to affect both demand and supply, estimates of when the output 
gap will close are particularly uncertain.

Economic slack and gasoline price dynamics are the main factors influencing 
consumer price index (CPI) inflation. Over the course of 2021, upward 
pressure on inflation coming in large part from higher gasoline prices is 
expected to temporarily outweigh downward pressure from economic slack. 
Subsequently, inflation is anticipated to be around 2 percent.

Economic activity more resilient to rising cases
Economic activity is expected to grow by about 5¼ percent on average over 
the first half of 2021 (Table 3), following a stronger-than-anticipated growth 
rate of 9.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020. While overall growth is 
robust, activity in the hardest-hit sectors remains weak in the near term due 
to the latest wave of the virus and related containment measures (Chart 6).

Last observation: January 2021

Housing construction and resales have reached record-high levels, 
supported by relatively high disposable incomes and low borrowing rates. 
The pandemic has also shifted household preferences toward larger homes 
and locations outside of city centres. The strong demand fundamentals amid 
relatively limited supply continue to fuel strong house price growth (Box 4).
Consumer spending is estimated to have remained flat in the first quarter 
and is expected to increase only modestly in the second quarter. Confidence 
is anticipated to improve further as vaccinations roll out and restrictions are 
eased. However, robust consumption growth is not expected until the third 
quarter.

Strengthening foreign demand and rising commodity prices have boosted 
prospects for growth in exports and business investment in the first half 
of 2021. As well, business confidence has been improving, and business 
financing conditions remain favourable (Chart 7). However, motor vehicle 
exports will temporarily contract significantly due to the global shortage of 
semiconductors.

Drivers of the strength in Canadian housing
Housing market activity and price growth have 
continued to be exceptionally strong. National resales 
have hit record highs, inventories of existing homes have 
reached record lows, and prices have increased rapidly. 
This has occurred despite elevated unemployment and 
lower immigration levels. Several demand and supply 
factors explain this strength.

Demand has been supported by relatively high 
disposable incomes and low mortgage rates. While job 
losses have risen during the pandemic, they have been 
concentrated among low-wage earners who tend to rent 
their homes rather than buy them. Remote work and 
more time spent at home have led to stronger demand 
for larger, single-family homes and toward housing in 
suburban and rural areas (Chart 4-A). One implication 
of this shift in demand is a pickup in new housing 
construction in regions with fewer supply constraints, 
such as a limited availability of land.

In the short run, however, supply cannot fully adjust to 
a sudden increase in housing demand of this size. It 
takes time for new units to come to market. The pace 
of construction over the past year has been hampered

by containment measures and shortages of materials 
and skilled workers. These factors are also putting 
upward pressure on construction costs. In addition, 
some potential sellers have been reluctant to show 
their homes during the pandemic, limiting the supply of 
existing houses for sale.

This combination of a strong increase in demand and a 
relatively limited supply of new and existing housing has 
contributed to the rapid price growth. Over time, supply 
is expected to adjust. A large number of building permits 
have been issued, with a growing share for single-family 
homes. Housing starts have also risen signifi cantly in 
recent months, most notably in rural areas (Chart 4-B). 
Ultimately, this greater supply and the anticipated 
moderation in demand should help rebalance housing 
markets and contribute to more sustainable price 
dynamics.

Last observations: building permits, February 2021;
housing starts, March 2021

While the strength in the housing market is rooted in 
a fundamental increase in demand, past experience 
shows that what starts out as fundamentals-based 
behaviour can turn into more speculative, extrapolative 
behaviour. This poses several risks. High prices could 
result in stretched borrowing and lending, leaving some 
households and fi nancial institutions more fi nancially 
vulnerable to an economic downturn. Recent proposed 
revisions to the Guideline B-20 by the Offi ce of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions are welcome 
steps to help reduce these risks. 

If excess housing is built relative to a more durable level 
of long-term demand, there could be an exaggerated 
cycle in housing activity. As a result, house prices, 
residential investment and consumption spending could 
decline. 

Significant economic slack in some sectors
The labour market remains difficult for many Canadians. Strong job gains 
in February and March 2021 followed large losses in previous months, 
with the swings driven mostly by changes in pandemic-related restrictions. 
The tightening of containment measures in April is expected to lead to 
another wave of job losses, mostly in low-wage and part-time work, before 
employment rebounds later in the second quarter.

(two-thirds of the 2019 annual median wage of $24.04 per hour). Seasonal factors may have contributed to the monthly dynamics.

Last observation: March 2021

Unemployment remains highest in sectors such as accommodation and food 
services and retail. Low-wage workers, women and young people continue to 
be the most affected (Chart 8). The latest spike in COVID-19 cases will likely 
delay the recovery in high-contact sectors, prolonging unevenness in the 
labour market recovery.

Roughly 300,000 additional people would need to be hired just to reach 
the pre-pandemic employment level.1 However, given population growth, 
to return the employment rate to where it was before the pandemic, the 
increase in jobs would actually need to be larger—roughly 475,000. 
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has declined from its peak of 13.7 percent 
in May 2020 to 7.5 percent in March 2021. Despite this improvement, the 
share of unemployed people who have been without a job for 27 weeks or 
more remains elevated, at about 30 percent. This is particularly concerning 
because long periods of unemployment have been associated with skill 
erosion and lower attachment to the labour market.

Indicators from the spring 2021 Business Outlook Survey provide evidence 
of unevenness in economic slack across sectors. Businesses facing stronger 
demand commonly reported capacity pressures. However, survey responses 
point to continued weakness in sectors such as accommodation, food and 
recreational services.

Looking at the economy as a whole, despite the strong estimated growth 
in the first quarter of 2021, considerable excess supply still exists. The 
Bank estimates that the output gap narrowed to between -3.0 percent and 
-2.0 percent in the first quarter (Box 1). Uncertainty around this range 
remains elevated.

1  The estimate of 300,000 is based on March 2021 employment.

CPI inflation boosted by temporary factors
Over the next few months, inflation is expected to rise temporarily to around 
the top of the 1 to 3 percent inflation-control target range. The transitory 
increase reflects the fact that the prices of some goods and services fell 
sharply with the sudden drop in demand at the onset of the pandemic. 
This results in base-year effects—CPI inflation appears higher on a year-
over-year basis because prices of gasoline, motor vehicles and traveller 
accommodations fell in early 2020. In addition, the increase in oil prices 
since December has driven gasoline prices above their pre-pandemic levels 
(Chart 9). In setting monetary policy, the Bank looks through such temporary 
movements in inflation.

Measures of core inflation have remained at or below 2 percent and have 
diverged since the first wave. Two measures—CPI-median and CPI-trim—
likely overstate underlying inflation given the unusual price movements that 
have occurred since the start of the pandemic (Box 5).

Productivity gains positive for potential output
In this Report, the Bank has returned to the usual timing of its annual 
assessment of potential output (Appendix 1). The profile for potential output 
is stronger than in the October 2020 Report, reflecting the improved outlook 
and the greater-than-expected resilience of economic activity. Despite this 
positive reassessment, potential output remains below levels estimated 
before the pandemic.

Potential output growth is projected to pick up over the projection horizon. 
The continued robust recovery in investment should strengthen trend labour 
productivity growth. Meanwhile, trend labour input growth is anticipated to be 
roughly flat, with population aging and labour market scarring offsetting gains 
from immigration.

The pandemic and related structural changes are expected to have lasting 
effects on potential output and GDP. These changes include more investment 
in digitalization, as reported in the spring 2021 Business Outlook Survey, as 
well as the shift toward remote work and online shopping. 

 
 

Box 5

Diverging measures of core infl ation under COVID-19
The pandemic is having unique impacts on prices 
and measures of total and core infl ation. In particular, 
the economic effects of COVID-19 have been highly 
uneven. Large shifts in consumption patterns have 
been accompanied by extreme price movements.1 In 
the most affected parts of the economy, such as travel 
services, drops in demand have resulted in sharp price 
declines. These hardest-hit sectors continue to show 
signs of considerable economic slack. In contrast, some 
components of the consumer price index (CPI) have 
seen price jumps due to relatively strong demand amid 
supply limitations.

Given the unique shifts in demand and supply and the 
resulting price movements caused by the pandemic and 
related containment measures, alternative measures of 
core infl ation may provide additional useful insights into 
the assessment of underlying infl ation.2

CPI-trim and CPI-median
CPI-median and CPI-trim fi lter out extreme price 
movements that might be caused by factors limited to 
specifi c components. CPI-trim does this by excluding 
components whose price changes fall in the top and 
bottom 20 percent in a given month. CPI-median 
excludes all monthly price changes except for the 
component at the midpoint of the distribution. In normal 
circumstances, this fi ltering helps give a better sense of 
overall infl ationary pressures by reducing the impact of 
large changes in the prices of individual components.

These measures have seen little movement since 
COVID-19 hit (Chart 5-A, panel a). Early in the 
pandemic, both CPI-median and CPI-trim excluded 
components with large, sudden price declines. These 
declines were felt in the most heavily affected sectors 
of the economy. By excluding these components, the 
measures had been putting more weight on components 
that were not affected (e.g., property taxes). However, 
when the prices of hard-hit components stopped falling 
and started to recover gradually, these measures tended

2015) and H. Lao and C. Steyn, “A Comprehensive Evaluation of Measures 
of Core Infl ation in Canada: An Update,” Bank of Canada Staff Discussion 
Paper No. 2019-9 (September 2019).

to include the associated increases. This resulted in 
an asymmetry. Because their composition is based 
on monthly price movements, these measures do not 
account for the fact that the price increases have been 
from particularly low levels. Consequently, CPI-median 
and CPI-trim have likely been overestimating underlying 
infl ation.

CPI-common
CPI-common tracks common price changes across 
multiple categories in the CPI basket. Common price 
movements indicate changes to overall demand. The 
weights are estimated using a statistical procedure called 
a factor model to detect these common variations. As a 
result, idiosyncratic price movements are averaged out.

CPI-common’s design means this measure tends to 
refl ect aggregate slack in the economy when spending 
patterns do not shift signifi cantly. Because the weights 
adjust very slowly over time, CPI-common treats price 
changes symmetrically on the way down and on the 
way up.

CPI-common is also more susceptible to base-year 
effects than the other two preferred measures because 
it is calculated using year-over-year price changes. 
Notably, sharp declines in the prices of electricity, 
clothing and footwear accounted for about three-
quarters of the fall in CPI-common between February 
and April 2020. A year later, base-year effects are 
working in the opposite direction and are expected to 
contribute about 0.2 percentage points to the pickup in 
CPI-common from February to April 2021.

A broader set of core measures
Alternative measures of core infl ation exclude or reduce 
the impact of some relatively volatile components, but 
they do so in different ways.

CPIX and CPIXFET each exclude a fi xed set of 
historically volatile components, such as food and 
energy in the case of CPIXFET, and adjust the 
remaining components to exclude the effects of 
changes in indirect taxes. Other countries commonly 
assess underlying infl ation using similar types of 
exclusion measures of core infl ation. CPIW includes

all components but assigns lower weights to those 
with higher historical volatility. The weights in all these 
measures are fi xed over two years.

MEANSTD does not have fi xed weights.3 However, it 
fi lters out large year-over-year price changes instead of 
month-over-month seasonally adjusted price changes. 
This feature should make it less susceptible to base-
year effects.

All of these alternative measures fell sharply at the 
beginning of the pandemic and for the most part have 
remained relatively low (Chart 5-A, panel b). This set 
of core infl ation measures, unlike CPI-trim and CPI-
median, is not subject to the potential upward bias 
associated with excluding large, rapid price declines 
while including smaller, more gradual price increases. 
These measures currently fall in a broad range around 
CPI-common, between 0.8 and 1.8 percent. 

3  MEANSTD excludes prices whose rate of year-over-year change is above or 

under 1.5 standard deviations from total infl ation.

The effects of such changes and their persistence cannot be estimated with 
precision. The strong 4 percent year-over-year growth in labour productivity 
in the fourth quarter of 2020 could, in part, indicate true and persistent labour 
productivity gains resulting from businesses adopting new technologies or 
improving their ways of doing business. However, because job losses were 
concentrated in low-wage, low-productivity positions, a compositional effect 
has temporarily boosted reported productivity growth.

Strong rebound in 2021 followed by moderate growth
Following a strong consumption-led recovery in 2021, growth is projected to 
ease over 2022 and 2023 and become increasingly broad-based and self-
sustaining. In the Bank’s forecast, economic activity is supported by strong 
foreign demand, the relatively high level of commodity prices, the recovery in 
confidence, and fiscal and monetary policy.

The timing of the recovery differs across components of demand. Housing 
and government spending have already surpassed their pre-pandemic 
levels, and growth in these components is anticipated to slow. In contrast, 

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONEtARy POlICy REPORt  •  APRIl 2021

CANADIAN ECONOMy  20 

consumption, investment and exports have yet to reach their pre-pandemic 
levels and are expected to first strengthen before their growth rates moderate 
later in the projection horizon.

Household spending to underpin the recovery
Consumption is anticipated to rebound in the second half of 2021 when 
spending on high-contact services increases. Growth of consumer 
expenditures is expected to remain strong over the projection horizon. 
Projected spending is supported by improved confidence, relatively high 
disposable income and low interest rates. As labour income and employment 
continue to recover, government transfers will become a decreasingly 
important source of support to disposable income.

On average, Canadian households have accumulated significantly more 
savings during the pandemic than usual (Chart 10). The Bank continues to 
assume that households will choose not to spend these savings on goods 
and services but instead use them to pay down debt, buy homes or invest. 
In addition, a heightened demand for precautionary savings is assumed 
to persist for some time. The savings rate is therefore expected to decline 
gradually and stay somewhat above its pre-pandemic level until the end of 
the projection horizon (Chart 11). A stronger rebound in consumer spending 
and a lower savings rate represent an upside risk to the outlook.

Prolonged labour market adjustment may contribute to cautiousness on the 
part of some consumers, including a demand for precautionary savings. It 
may take a long time for some businesses in severely affected sectors to 
recover and rehire workers. Moreover, employment in some sectors may 
never return to pre-pandemic levels, meaning workers may need to find jobs 
in other sectors—a process that could take some time and require retraining.

Housing activity is expected to soften but remain well above pre-pandemic 
levels over the projection horizon. The preference for larger homes will 
likely remain a factor affecting the housing market after the pandemic given 
the expected permanent rise in remote work. In addition, higher levels of 
immigration are expected to contribute to strong population growth later in 
the projection horizon. These sources of demand should support elevated 
levels of new home construction and renovation spending. Housing resales 
are projected to soften from very high levels. This is partly because some 
homebuyers may have moved their purchases forward to lock in low 
mortgage rates, especially given expectations of rising prices.2

Foreign demand to drive a solid recovery in exports
A strong US recovery is projected to support robust export growth (Chart 12). 
Goods exports are expected to strengthen because of improving global 
demand and higher prices for a wide range of commodities. These positive 
effects are likely to substantially exceed the adverse impacts of the recent 
appreciation of the Canadian dollar. The healthy rebound in US industrial 
production should boost demand for Canadian exports of machinery and 
equipment and non-energy commodities. Meanwhile, motor vehicle exports 
will likely remain below pre-pandemic levels, mostly due to scheduled 
reductions in production mandates.

Services exports should rebound from weak levels as travel restrictions are 
eased. However, evidence from surveys suggests the recovery will be drawn 
out for some services, such as business travel.3 Businesses may reduce 
travel budgets in favour of more teleconferencing and a smaller carbon 
footprint.

2  The results of the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations for the first quarter of 2021 show that 

consumers’ expectations for house price growth edged up across the country.

3  For example, 61 percent of respondents in the latest Conference Board of Canada survey of business 
leaders (February 2021) expect their business travel to remain below pre-pandemic levels indefinitely.

Current levels of oil prices and solid US refinery demand for Canadian crude 
oil should support moderate growth in energy exports. Crude-by-rail exports 
are expected to become more prevalent in the near term until additional 
pipeline capacity comes online at the end of 2021.

Imports are projected to grow in line with strong domestic demand.

Business investment to strengthen
Investment growth outside the oil and gas sector is expected to pick up in 
2021 as domestic and foreign demand increase and capacity pressures 
mount (Chart 13). The spring 2021 Business Outlook Survey revealed that 
one-quarter of firms are resuming or catching up with their investment plans, 
including spending on automation and digitalization. The accelerated trend 
toward e-commerce is expected to support stronger investment in machinery 
and equipment as well as in warehouses and related structures.

The recovery in business investment will likely be uneven, however. 
Increased remote work and online shopping may lead to reduced demand for 
office and retail space.

Investment growth in the oil and gas sector is expected to pick up, reflecting 
the recent rise in oil and natural gas prices. At current prices, most existing 
oil projects can cover businesses’ operational and transportation expenses. 
However, the desire to reduce leverage, uncertainty about future prices and 
a heightened focus on climate change will continue to challenge the sector. 
As a result, investment in the sector is expected to remain below its pre-
pandemic level throughout the projection horizon.

Inventory investment is projected to rise and contribute about 1 percentage 
point to real GDP growth in 2021. Businesses are anticipated to continue 
rebuilding their low retail inventories after unprecedented drawdowns in 2020.

Economic slack to weigh on inflation over 2021 
and 2022
After rising to around 3 percent—the top of the inflation-control range—
CPI inflation is expected to decline toward 2 percent over the second half of 
2021. This easing largely reflects diminishing base-year effects from gasoline 
prices.

Inflation is projected to decline further in the first half of 2022. This reflects 
commodity prices no longer being a source of upward pressures, while 
economic slack continues to be a drag on inflation. Although the timing is 
highly uncertain, inflation is expected to be at around 2 percent in the second 
half of 2022, as economic slack is absorbed (Chart 14).
The uncertainty around the inflation outlook is greater than usual. This partly 
reflects the different impacts the virus and lockdowns have had on sectors, 
businesses and groups of workers, creating an unusual degree of uncertainty 
about the amount of slack in the economy. As discussed earlier, estimates of 
when the output gap will close are highly uncertain. As well, the concentration 
of job losses in sectors where job reallocation prospects are typically weak 
may imply that labour market slack will be absorbed more slowly than usual, 
possibly putting ongoing downward pressure on inflation.

This projection is consistent with medium- and long-term inflation 
expectations remaining well anchored at the 2 percent target. Most firms 
that participated in the spring 2021 Business Outlook Survey expect that 
inflation over the next two years will remain within the Bank’s inflation-control 
target range of 1 to 3 percent. More respondents than in the previous survey 
expect inflation to be in the upper half of that range. Firms’ views reflect 
strong anticipated demand related to fiscal and monetary policy support and 
the future easing of restrictions. As in recent years, most respondents to

Evolution of the Bank’s 
Evolution of the Bank’s 
balance sheet 
balance sheet 

Since March 2020, the Bank has used balance sheet tools to provide 
extraordinary liquidity support and monetary stimulus to the Canadian 
economy. In the early stages of the pandemic, programs and facilities were 
focused on restoring market functioning and bolstering funding liquidity to 
keep credit flowing.4 Initially, purchases of Government of Canada (GoC) 
bonds through the Government Bond Purchase Program aimed to ease 
strains in the GoC bond market. These purchases also enhanced the 
effectiveness of other policy actions.

As liquidity conditions in the GoC bond market improved, the primary 
objective of bond purchases shifted toward a focus on monetary stimulus. 
The cumulative stock, the flow and the composition of quantitative easing 
(QE) purchases continue to put downward pressure on borrowing rates, 
supporting economic activity. QE also reinforces monetary stimulus provided 
by the Bank’s forward guidance. This guidance has committed to holding 
the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is 
absorbed, so the inflation target is sustainably achieved.

The evolution in the size and composition of the Bank’s balance sheet 
reflects the transition between these two objectives—market functioning and 
monetary stimulus—of the GoC bond purchase program (Chart 15). The 
liquidity and other asset purchase programs were successful in restoring 
well-functioning markets and have been gradually wound down since 
October. As a result, by the end of April, the value of total assets on the 
Bank’s balance sheet is expected to decline to about $475 billion, compared 
with $575 billion in February. This is largely because over $140 billion in 
shorter-term assets will have matured. Notably, about $120 billion in extended 
term repos will have expired. As the total value of assets has decreased, 
so has the level of settlement balances, which are expected to decline from 
close to $400 billion in early March to roughly $290 billion by the end of April. 
More recently, the Bank announced that the remaining programs that support 
market functioning will expire on schedule in April and May. The Bank will 
also suspend term repo operations, which will further limit growth of the 
balance sheet.5

the various programs.

Last observation: April 14, 2021

Because the ongoing recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary 
stimulus, the Bank has maintained its QE purchases. GoC bonds now make 
up the largest part of the Bank’s balance sheet at more than 70 percent of 
total assets, compared with 55 percent in the January Report. Moreover, 
the Bank’s total ownership of GoC bonds outstanding has increased to 
about 42 percent. Since March 2020, the Bank has purchased more than 
35 percent of total sovereign bonds outstanding, a higher percentage than 
that of other central banks (Chart 16). Considering the size of Canada’s 
bond market and of its economy, this means that the Bank has provided a 
significant amount of stimulus.

Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook

Uncertainty around the projection remains unusually high. The projection 
still depends considerably on how the pandemic evolves, most notably with 
respect to vaccination rollouts and the spread of COVID-19 variants. 

Several risks identified in previous reports have materialized. In particular, the 
timeline for broad-based immunity has shortened in the United States, the 
rate of vaccination has picked up in Canada, and strong Canadian data in the 
first quarter indicate greater economic resilience to containment measures. 
As well, the US administration has approved a large fiscal stimulus package. 
However, a third wave of the virus in Canada has led provincial authorities to 
reimpose lockdowns. 

The outlook for inflation is subject to several upside and downside risks. 
The Bank presents a selection of risks identified as most important for the 
projected path of inflation, drawing from a larger set of risks considered in the 
base-case projection. The Bank views these risks as roughly balanced.

(i)  More severe third wave and more persistent pandemic (↓)

Since January, some upside risks associated with the ability to limit 
the impacts of the virus have been realized and are now embedded in 
the base-case projection. As a result, pandemic-related risks are now 
skewed to the downside. The spread of more contagious variants may 
be more severe than expected, leading authorities to impose stricter 
and longer-lasting containment measures. In addition, vaccines may be 
less effective at containing the disease than assumed. It may also take 
longer to achieve broad-based immunity. A more severe third wave or a 
more persistent pandemic would lead to additional weakness in output 
and employment as well as more adverse and persistent effects on 
confidence. With a more prolonged period of weak economic activity, 
some risks that have diminished over time, such as labour market 
scarring and corporate financial stress, could re-emerge.

(ii)  Stronger household spending in Canada (↑)

Household savings have increased dramatically since the pandemic 
began, particularly for higher-income households. This reflects 
fewer opportunities to spend and increased precautionary savings. 
Households could spend some of these extra savings on goods and 
services rather than use them to pay down debt or invest in financial 
assets. Households could also revert to their pre-pandemic savings 
rates sooner. In either case, consumption and residential investment 
would be stronger, contributing to inflationary pressures.6

6  For a detailed analysis of this risk, see L. Schembri, “COVID-19, Savings and Household Spending” 

(speech delivered virtually to Restaurants Canada, Toronto, March 11, 2021).

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONEtARy POlICy REPORt  •  APRIl 2021

RISKS tO tHE INFlAtION OUtlOOK  29 

(iii)  Stronger growth in the United States (↑)

US economic growth could be materially stronger if people spend 
some of the extra savings built up during the pandemic. Moreover, 
there could be additional fiscal stimulus, for example, from the 
proposed American Jobs Plan.

(iv)  More persistent cost pressures (↑)

Businesses are facing rising costs, such as higher prices for raw 
material inputs. Possible labour shortages in specific sectors and 
occupations could also play a role. In addition, disruptions to business 
operations brought about by the pandemic may lead firms to adjust 
their supply chains and production processes in ways that could 
increase costs. In an environment of strong demand, businesses 
may find that they are better able to raise prices to pass along higher 
expenses to consumers or to rebuild their margins.

(v)  Higher Canadian potential output (↓)

The profile for potential output growth in Canada is stronger than that 
in the October 2020 Report. However, given the nature of the shock 
and elevated uncertainty, potential output could be even stronger 
than assumed. Strong productivity growth in 2020 may indicate 
that accelerated automation and digitalization have played a more 
important role than assumed, implying higher trend productivity in 
recent quarters and over the projection horizon. All else equal, stronger 
potential output eases inflationary pressures in the economy.

(vi)  Weaker exports (↓)

Canadian exports could be weaker than in the base-case projection. 
The Canadian dollar has reached its highest level since early 2018. 
The decrease in competitiveness associated with a stronger Canadian 
dollar could further weigh on Canadian exports. At the same time, Buy 
American provisions in the United States could mute the benefit to 
Canadian exporters of strong US demand.

Appendix 1: Potential output

The Bank’s estimates of potential output in Canada and globally have been 
revised up compared with the estimates presented in the October 2020 
Report (Table A1-1 and Table A1-2). While significant, these positive 
revisions leave the projected level of potential output below the levels Bank 
staff estimated before the pandemic. By 2023, Canada’s potential output level 
is expected to be about 1 percent below the pre-pandemic estimate.7 

Global potential output growth to pick up
The COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp slowdown in potential output growth 
in 2020 around the world (Table A1-1). However, looking ahead, global 
potential output growth is expected to recover from 2.3 percent in 2020 to 
3.0 percent in 2022 and 2023, as the disruptive effects of the pandemic fade.8

APPENDIx 1: POtENtIAl OUtPUt  31 

Improvement in trend total factor productivity growth in all regions explains 
a large part of that recovery. Drags from physical distancing protocols 
are expected to dissipate. In addition, the pandemic has accelerated the 
reallocation of labour and capital to more productive firms and encouraged 
a faster adoption of digital technologies. Trend labour input growth is also 
anticipated to rise, especially in advanced economies. However, ongoing 
headwinds from population aging across most regions should continue to 
weigh on potential output growth over the projection horizon.

Compared with the October 2020 assessment, potential output growth 
has been revised up in all regions. This adjustment is due mainly to the 
positive implications of vaccination for the global economy. The availability 
of vaccines and their faster-than-expected delivery, especially in advanced 
economies, has shortened the estimated duration of the pandemic. This 
should result in less long-term unemployment and fewer permanent 
withdrawals from the labour force. It should also reduce the costs of 
physical distancing imposed on firms. The negative economic impacts of 
the pandemic have also been less severe than expected in several regions. 
In particular, the persistent adverse effects on the capital stock and trend 
productivity are now estimated to be less significant than assessed in the 
October Report.

Stronger trend labour productivity growth in Canada
The profile for potential output growth in Canada has also been revised 
up compared with the October 2020 assessment. This is due to the 
improvement in economic prospects and the greater-than-expected resilience 
of the economy to the pandemic (Table A1-2). On average, from 2021 to 
2023, potential output growth is 0.5 percentage points higher than in the 
October Report.9

The main driver of the revision is a stronger investment profile, which 
has boosted trend labour productivity growth over the projection horizon. 
Business investment levels are forecast to be higher than was expected in 
October because of reduced uncertainty and stronger anticipated demand 
once the pandemic ends. Public investment in capital is also revised up to 
capture increased fiscal spending and positive historical revisions.

the Neutral Rate in Canada: 2021 Update,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2021-6 (April 2021).

The Bank no longer assumes total factor productivity will be negatively 
affected by the pandemic. The more favourable economic conditions imply 
less destruction of both firms and intangible capital. In addition, automation 
and digitalization, which have been increasing at a faster pace since the 
beginning of the pandemic, enhance total factor productivity growth. These 
effects are relevant over both the past year and coming years.

Potential output growth is expected to pick up over the projection horizon 
because of stronger trend labour productivity growth. In particular, investment 
will continue to recover at a robust pace.

Trend labour input growth is expected to be flat from 2022 to 2024. This 
reflects two opposing forces. Population growth should increase after 2021, 
supported by higher immigration targets and an anticipated return to pre-
pandemic levels of flows of non-permanent residents in 2022. However, 
labour market scarring and population aging offset the gains from stronger 
population growth.

mote the economic and fi nancial well-being of Canadians.

year, and full updates of the Bank’s outlook, including 
risks to the projection, are published four times per year 
in the Monetary Policy Report.

  Canada’s experience with infl ation targeting since 1991 
has shown that the best way to foster confi dence in the 
value of money and to contribute to sustained economic 
growth, employment gains and improved living stan-
dards is by keeping infl ation low, stable and predictable.

Inﬂ ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible
  Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is symmetric, 

which means that the Bank is equally concerned about 
infl ation rising above or falling below the 2 per cent target.

  In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada 

renewed Canada’s infl ation-control target for a further 
fi ve-year period, ending 31 December 2021. The target, 
as measured by the total consumer price index (CPI), 
remains at the 2 per cent midpoint of the control range 
of 1 to 3 per cent.

  Canada’s infl ation-targeting framework is fl exible. 

Typically, the Bank seeks to return infl ation to target over 
a horizon of six to eight quarters. However, the most 
appropriate horizon for returning infl ation to target will 
vary depending on the nature and persistence of the 
shocks buffeting the economy.

The monetary policy instrument
  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes 

in the target for the overnight rate of interest.2 These 
changes are transmitted to the economy through their 
infl uence on market interest rates, domestic asset prices 
and the exchange rate, which affect total demand for 
Canadian goods and services. The balance between 
this demand and the economy’s production capacity is, 
over time, the primary determinant of infl ation pressures 
in the economy.

  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to 
eight quarters—to work their way through the economy 
and have their full effect on infl ation. For this reason, 
monetary policy must be forward-looking.

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent 

communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspec-
tive on the forces at work on the economy and their 
implications for infl ation. The Monetary Policy Report 
is a key element of this approach. Policy decisions are 
typically announced on eight pre-set days during the 

Monitoring inﬂ ation
  In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components 
can be particularly volatile. These components, as well 
as changes in indirect taxes such as GST, can cause 
sizable fl uctuations in total CPI.

  In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look 

through such transitory movements in total CPI infl ation 
and focuses on a set of “core” infl ation measures that 
better refl ect the underlying trend of infl ation. In this 
sense, these measures act as an operational guide to 
help the Bank achieve the total CPI infl ation target. They 
are not a replacement for total CPI infl ation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl ation 
are CPI-trim, which excludes CPI components whose 
rates of change in a given month are the most extreme; 
CPI-median, which corresponds to the price change 
located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket weight) 
of the distribution of price changes; and CPI-common, 
which uses a statistical procedure to track common 
price changes across categories in the CPI basket.

Infl ation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide additional  monetary 

stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website, describes 
these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Global Economy

The global economy improved in the second half of 2016, and economic 
growth is forecast to continue to strengthen over the projection horizon. In 
particular, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States 
picked up after a weak first half of the year and is expected to remain solid. 
Meanwhile, contractionary pressures appear to have reached a trough 
in some emerging-market economies (EMEs). Overall, global economic 
growth is projected to increase from just under 3 per cent in 2016 to about 
3 1/2 per cent by 2018 (Table 1). 

The outlook, however, is subject to considerable uncertainty, given the 
unknowns around policy actions by the incoming US administration, par-
ticularly concerning trade. These potential policy changes pose important 
risks to the current projection, which will be updated in future reports as 
additional details become available.

Bond yields have risen, though financial conditions remain 
accommodative
Yields on long-term government bonds in the United States have risen to 
levels prevailing in mid-2015 (Chart 1). This increase mainly reflects market 
expectations of a shift in the policy mix under the incoming US administra-
tion, with an anticipated fiscal expansion bringing higher growth, inflation

and policy interest rates. Long-term yields have also risen in many other 
advanced and emerging economies, albeit to a lesser degree. Ongoing 
monetary policy stimulus has limited the rise in yields in the euro area and 
Japan. 

In this context, the US dollar has continued to appreciate against most 
other advanced and emerging-market currencies, reaching its highest level 
in nearly 15 years on a nominal trade-weighted basis. This exchange rate 
adjustment should help to redistribute global demand. At the same time, 
positive market sentiment about the US economy has led to increased port-
folio outflows from several EMEs since the October Report, contributing to a 
tightening in financial conditions in some of these economies (Chart 2). 

Expectations of stronger US growth have also supported a rally in stock 
markets in advanced economies. The presumption that the incoming US 
administration will cut corporate taxes and roll back regulations has likely 
contributed to strong gains in US equities with domestic exposures. 

The US economy is expected to strengthen in 2017 
and  2018
The underlying dynamics of the US economy remain largely as outlined in 
the October projection. Growth is expected to rebound in the second half 
of 2016 after a weaker first half, in part reflecting the positive contribution 
of inventory investment. The growth profile for 2017 and 2018 has been 
revised upward, by about 0.1 and 0.3 percentage points, respectively, taking 
into account initial assumptions about the anticipated shift in fiscal policy. 
Stronger growth prospects are reflected in improvements in indicators of 
business optimism and consumer confidence (Chart 3).

While the nature and timing of fiscal policy changes in the United States are 
unknown, the base-case projection for the US economy embeds an element 
of fiscal expansion, which boosts the level of GDP by about 0.5 per cent 
by the end of 2018.1 Considerable uncertainty remains regarding the scale 
of any future cuts in tax rates and the extent to which they may be accom-
panied by offsetting measures that will affect the tax base and by changes 

1  This is assumed to come in the form of cuts to personal and corporate taxes amounting to a cumulative 

1.4 per cent of GDP. The overall effect on aggregate demand and GDP is based on multipliers drawn 
from the literature.

in various categories of spending. Accordingly, this base case should be 
viewed as a reasonable starting point that will be updated as the incoming 
administration’s plans take shape.

Consumption growth is projected to remain healthy, supported by robust 
fundamentals, including a strong labour market with gradually rising wages 
(Chart 4). Business investment is expected to regain momentum as growth 
in demand remains above growth in potential output.2 Energy investment is 
anticipated to support the recovery in capital expenditures, with higher oil 
prices encouraging a gradual rise in drilling activity. Residential investment 
is projected to grow at a healthy pace as household incomes rise and con-
struction activity picks up to meet demographic demand. At the same time, 
the more robust profile for domestic demand is partly offset by a larger drag 
from net exports associated with a stronger US dollar. 

Core personal consumption expenditure inflation is expected to gradually 
increase. At the same time, wage pressures are rising in an economy that 
is running close to full employment. The recent strength in the US dollar 
should, however, dampen inflationary pressures.

The growth outlook for other advanced economies is modest
In Japan, third-quarter growth surprised on the upside, and revisions to its 
national accounts indicate greater momentum than previously assessed. In 
addition, stronger external demand coming from the United States and a 
weaker yen should boost output. As a result, Japan’s GDP is projected to 
grow by an average of around 1 per cent over 2016–18, slightly higher than 
anticipated in the October Report.

In the euro area, economic activity and employment growth have held up 
despite financial system stresses in some countries and elevated political 
uncertainty, particularly around the consequences of Brexit. Growth over 
the projection horizon should continue to be modest, tempered by structural 
factors, including labour market rigidities.

2  The Bank’s estimate of US potential output growth is about 1.8 per cent in 2018.

Emerging-market economies continue to drive global 
growth, but face challenges
The Chinese economy continues to rebalance toward a more sustainable 
growth path, broadly in line with the expectations set out in the October 
Report. GDP growth is projected to soften gradually, from 6.6 per cent in 
2016 to 6.4 per cent in 2018.3 Growth of business investment is expected to 
slow as reforms to state-owned enterprises continue, particularly steps to 
address overcapacity in some segments of the mining and manufacturing 
sectors. Residential investment should also be dampened by measures 
recently introduced by local governments to curb rapid growth in housing 
sales and prices. 

In other oil-importing EMEs, growth in both 2016 and 2017 is expected to be 
slightly lower relative to the October Report. Domestic factors, such as chal-
lenges in implementing structural reforms, as well as capital outflows and 
tighter financial conditions will restrain economic activity in some countries. 
This effect will be somewhat offset, however, by weaker currencies, which 
should boost net exports. Overall, GDP growth is projected to strengthen 
gradually, from 3.3 per cent in 2016 to 4.4 per cent in 2018. This pickup is 
expected to be driven primarily by Latin America, supported, in part, by the 
bottoming-out of the recession in Brazil.

Growth in the rest of the world is expected to accelerate from 1 per cent 
in 2016 to 3 per cent in 2018. This pickup is mainly due to the anticipated 
recovery in oil-exporting EMEs, such as Russia and Saudi Arabia, as oil 
prices stabilize and the adjustment to past oil price declines runs its course.

Commodity prices have moved up, led by oil
Global crude oil benchmark prices have recently averaged about 15 per cent 
higher than assumed in the October Report. Part of this increase reflects the 
agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 
(OPEC) and other oil producers to cut output to hasten the rebalancing in the 
oil market. The Bank still expects a significant drawdown in oil inventories in 
the second half of 2017, as demand growth is projected to outpace growth in 
production (Chart 5). 

By convention, the Bank assumes that oil prices will remain near their recent 
levels. The per-barrel prices for Brent, West Texas Intermediate and Western 
Canada Select in US dollars have recently averaged about $55, $50 and 
$35, respectively, roughly $3 to $7 higher than the October assumption (see 
Box 1 on page 8).

Risks to the Bank’s oil price assumption remain tilted to the upside over 
2017–18, since prices are still below levels likely required to support medium-
term market rebalancing. The scope for sustained higher prices is limited, 
however, because technological advances have contributed to lower 
production costs for unconventional oil production, notably shale oil in the 
United States. 

3  The renminbi has continued to depreciate against the US dollar, weakening by another 5 per cent over 

2016. The Chinese authorities recently announced adjustments to the basket of currencies used to 
assess the value of the renminbi, reducing the weights of major advanced economy currencies and 
adding new currencies.

There has been significant divergence in the evolution of non-energy com-
modity prices. Base metal prices have surged, particularly for iron and 
copper, driven in part by expectations of infrastructure spending in the 
United States. In contrast, gold prices have fallen, partly in anticipation of 
tighter US monetary policy.

Canadian Economy

The Canadian economy is evolving largely as expected, but the outlook 
needs to be viewed in the context of elevated policy uncertainty at the 
global level. The adjustment of the Canadian economy to past declines in 
commodity prices is progressing. Activity in resource-related industries 
appears to have troughed.4 At the same time, investment and employment 
are being reallocated to other sectors of the economy that are expanding, 
most notably the service sector. The broader effects of the past deteri-
oration of the terms of trade on real incomes and wealth will likely be an 
ongoing constraint on the growth of economic activity through 2017.

Real GDP is expected to grow at a rate moderately above that of potential 
output throughout the projection horizon (Table 2 and Box 1). Growth in 
the service sector in particular will underpin rising employment, household 
incomes and consumption. A modest expansion of exports and investment 
will be supported by strengthening foreign demand, although persistent 
competitiveness challenges are expected to restrain growth in production of 
non-energy goods. Export growth will be limited by the recent appreciation 
of the Canadian dollar, alongside that of the US dollar, vis-à-vis most other 
currencies.

Key Inputs to the Base-Case Projection
the Bank’s projection is always conditional on several key 
assumptions, and changes to them will aﬀ ect the outlook 
for the global and Canadian economies . the Bank regularly 
reviews these assumptions and assesses the sensitivity of 
the economic projection to them .
•  Oil prices are assumed to remain near their average 
levels at the time the projection was conducted . the 
per-barrel prices in US dollars for Brent, West texas 
Intermediate and Western Canada Select are about 
$55, $50 and $35, respectively, $3 to $7 higher than 
the assumption in the October Report .

•  By convention, the Bank does not attempt to forecast the 
exchange rate in the base-case projection . therefore, over 
the projection horizon, the Canadian dollar is assumed to 
remain close to its average of 75 cents observed at the 
time the projection was conducted . this assumption is 
broadly unchanged from the October Report . 

•  the output gap is assumed to show excess capacity of 

1 1/4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016, based on the 
midpoint of the Bank’s estimate that excess capacity in 

the Canadian economy was in a range of 3/4 to 1 3/4 per 
cent .1 this assumption compares with the October 
assumption of 1 1/2 per cent excess capacity for the 
third quarter .

•  Potential output growth is assumed to be about 1 .5 per 

cent over the 2017–18 projection horizon, close to the 
midpoint of the Bank’s estimated range (Table 2) . this 
assumption is unchanged from October . Further details 
on the Bank’s assessment of potential output are pro-
vided in the Appendix to the April 2016 Report .

•  the neutral nominal policy rate in Canada is estimated to 
be between 2 .75 per cent and 3 .75 per cent . the current 
projection is based on the midpoint of this range, which 
is unchanged from the October assumption .

1  Since the release of the October Report, National Accounts data for the third 
quarter of 2016 were released, together with historical revisions from the fi rst 
quarter of 2013 to the second quarter of 2016 . In the third quarter of 2016, the 
level of real gross domestic product (GDP) is now about 0 .4 per cent higher than 
estimated in October, mostly because of higher business investment, which 
suggests that the level of potential GDP is also higher than previously assessed .

Monetary and financial conditions, the strengthening US and global econo-
mies and federal fiscal stimulus are expected to support economic activity, 
despite a modest increase in longer-term borrowing costs since October. 
Residential investment will be tempered by recent increases in mortgage 
rates and measures implemented by the federal government in October to 
mitigate risks to financial stability.

While the full range of possible policy changes in the United States has 
not been incorporated, the outlook does include an initial benchmark 
assumption about fiscal stimulus that boosts demand for Canadian exports 
and supports business confidence in Canada. This positive effect is, 
however, tempered by a deterioration in Canadian competitiveness related 
to assumed corporate tax cuts in the United States. While prospective 
protectionist trade measures in the United States would have material con-
sequences for Canadian investment and exports, these measures have not 
been included in the base case.

The output gap is expected to close around mid-2018, similar to the October 
projection. Total consumer price index (CPI) inflation is projected to be near 
2 per cent through 2017 and 2018 as the offsetting effects of higher con-
sumer energy prices and lower food prices dissipate and economic slack 
is absorbed. Over the near term, however, total CPI is expected to remain 
lower than was anticipated in October, mainly reflecting weaker-than-
expected food prices.

Following a strong rebound in the third quarter, near-term 
growth will slow to a solid pace
Following a very weak second quarter, largely due to the Alberta wildfires 
and a sharp decline in non-energy exports, economic growth rebounded 
strongly (Table 3 and Chart 6). Growth was temporarily boosted by the 
resumption of production in the oil sands and a partial rebound in non-
energy exports. Consumption, especially of services, remained robust, 
benefiting from the rollout of the Canada Child Benefit.

In contrast, residential investment fell in the third quarter for the first time 
since the beginning of 2014. Government expenditures contracted modestly 
as public capital formation was less than expected in the third quarter. 
Business investment remained weak, despite a significant temporary jump 
associated with the arrival of an imported production module destined for 
the Hebron offshore oil project.

As the temporary factors that spurred activity in the third quarter of 2016 
dissipate, growth will moderate to average about 2 per cent over the fourth 
quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, underpinned by solid household 
consumption and fiscal infrastructure spending.5 Residential investment, 
however, is expected to contract further as resale activity is dampened by 
higher mortgage rates and the recent changes to federal housing finance 
policies. On balance, growth in business investment and exports of non-
energy goods will remain modest.

Material economic slack remains
Estimates from the Bank’s two measures of economic slack continue to 
point to material excess capacity.6 Similarly, the latest results from the 
winter Business Outlook Survey indicate that capacity pressures are roughly 
unchanged from the previous survey.

National employment growth has remained firm over the past year, although 
it has been concentrated in part-time employment. Total hours worked have 
not risen and, in contrast to the United States, wage pressures continue 
to be subdued. Overall, the Bank’s labour market indicator suggests an 
increase in slack over the past year.

In the context of the ongoing adjustment of the economy, employment 
outside the energy-intensive provinces (mainly in Ontario, British Columbia 
and Quebec) has registered solid gains, primarily in service industries. While 
employment in the energy-intensive provinces has declined over the past 
year, there are some tentative signs that it is stabilizing.

Interprovincial migration has helped the reallocation of resources in the 
economy. Migration to Alberta has reversed from a net inflow of more than 
10,000 persons in the second quarter of 2014 to a net outflow of close to 
4,000 persons in the third quarter of 2016. Corresponding flows into Ontario, 
in particular, have risen sharply (Chart 7).

The Bank judges that excess capacity in the economy in the fourth quarter 
was between 3/4 and 1 3/4 per cent.

Inflation remains below 2 per cent
Total CPI inflation for November, at 1.2 per cent, remained in the bottom 
half of the Bank’s inflation-control range of 1 to 3 per cent. Goods inflation 
is subdued, largely reflecting low food and consumer energy inflation. Total 
CPI inflation was somewhat weaker than anticipated because retail food 
prices declined by about 2 per cent on a year-over-year basis in recent 
months, their lowest rate since 1992. The weakness in food inflation reflects 
the past declines in agricultural commodity prices, the waning of exchange 
rate pass-through and intensified competition in the retail food sector.

The Bank now uses three new measures of core inflation to obtain a more 
reliable gauge of the underlying trend of inflation (Box 2). These measures 
have declined since mid-2016 to below 2 per cent, partly reflecting the 

5  The anticipated overall impact of the fiscal stimulus announced in the March 2016 federal budget 
is unchanged from estimates provided in the April Report. Modest additional stimulus measures 
announced in November in the government’s fall economic statement, as well as those recently 
announced by provincial governments, have been incorporated in the Bank’s base-case projection.

diminishing effects of exchange rate pass-through (Chart 8). They are 
broadly consistent with the Bank’s assessment of the degree of excess 
capacity in the Canadian economy.

Total CPI inflation is expected to rise from 1.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 
2016 to 1.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2017, as gasoline prices increase on 
a year-over-year basis. Consumer energy price inflation will rise temporarily 
in 2017 to reflect higher prices for energy commodities and the impact of the 
new regulations related to the cap-and-trade plan in Ontario and the carbon 
levy in Alberta.

Box 2

New Measures of Core Infl ation
In the most recent renewal of the infl ation-control target, 
the Bank evaluated the properties of several measures of 
core infl ation .1 Such measures are useful because they are 
indicative of the fundamental forces driving infl ation .
CPI-trim, CPI-median and CPI-common were found to be 
more reliable measures of core infl ation than CPIX,2 based 
on a broad set of evaluation criteria . As a result, the Bank 
has decided to use these three new measures of core infl a-
tion instead of CPIX .

Defi nitions of the three preferred measures of 
core infl ation
CPI-trim (trimmed mean) excludes CPI components whose 
rates of change in a given month are showing the most 
extreme movements .
CPI-median (weighted median) corresponds to the price 
change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of CPI 
basket weights) of the distribution of price changes in a 
given month .
CPI-common (common component) tracks common price 
movements across categories in the CPI basket .
CPI-trim, CPI-median and CPI-common performed better 
than CPIX for two main reasons: (i) they are less infl uenced 
by sector-specifi c shocks and can better capture persis-
tent movements in infl ation, and (ii) they have stronger 
empiri cal relationships with macroeconomic variables that 
are theoretically important for the conduct of monetary 
policy (Table 2-A) .
the three new measures of core infl ation were relatively 
successful in looking through episodes when product-specifi c 
price movements aﬀ ected certain CPI components . In 
contrast, CPIX was unable to fi lter these transitory shocks 
because it rigidly excludes a fi xed set of pre-specifi ed com-
ponents . Examples of such episodes are the sharp rise in auto 
insurance premiums in the early 2000s, pronounced drops 
in auto prices starting in 2007 and the surge in meat prices 
in 2014 (Chart 2-A) .

In addition, core infl ation is an important indicator of the 
state of excess demand or supply in the economy . Peak corre-
lations with the output gap  are signifi cantly higher for CPI-
trim, CPI-median and CPI-common than for CPIX (Table 2-A) . 
the evaluation revealed that each measure of core infl ation 
has not only its own strengths but also some limitations, 
thus making the case for using multiple measures rather 
than relying on a single indicator .

As the economy adjusts, growth will pick up
Overall economic growth is being supported by the expanding service sector 
while the drag from the commodity price decline on the resource sector dis-
sipates. In particular, activity in resource-related industries is showing signs of 
bottoming out (Chart 9). The goods sector has started to grow on a year-over-
year basis, after two years of near-steady declines (Chart 10).

Bank’s more-detailed consultations with firms in the energy sector find 
 cautious optimism and modest increases in capital expenditures.

Since late 2014, the service sector has been growing at an average annual-
ized rate of near 2 per cent, which can account for all the growth in real GDP. 
Moreover, exports of services, driven by foreign sales of commercial services 
and travel services (Chart 11), have outperformed goods exports. This growth 
in the service sector has fuelled gains in employment, especially in positions 
that pay above-average wages. Results of the winter Business Outlook Survey 
suggest that the service sector will continue to experience solid growth.

The Bank estimates real GDP growth of 1.3 per cent in 2016 before picking 
up to around 2 per cent in 2017 and 2018 (Table 2 and Table 3). As in 
October, household expenditures are projected to be the main contributor to 
overall growth in 2017, together with sizable additional support from govern-
ment spending and from exports. The annual contribution from business 
investment is anticipated to turn positive in 2018.

Exports are expected to grow at a moderate pace
Canadian oil production and exports are expected to expand over the 
projection horizon, although the declines in energy sector investment in 
recent years will restrain their growth. Increases in non-energy commodity 
exports are also expected to be modest, given persistent competitiveness 
challenges that will dampen production and investment in the sector.7 The 
recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the currencies of some 
key competitors is projected to weigh on Canadian export growth.

In recent years, non-commodity exports have not been as strong as 
expected. Consequently, the Bank updated its framework to better account 
for the evolving nature of foreign demand and structural factors, including 
competitiveness challenges (Box 3).

7  Moreover, revisions to business investment data indicate that declines in mining and quarrying were 
much more pronounced in 2013 and 2014 than previously reported, with a further significant contrac-
tion in 2015.

A Revised Framework for Forecasting Exports
the Bank’s forecast for non-commodity exports (NCX) 
relies signifi cantly on its estimate of foreign demand for 
Canadian fi rms’ goods and services . to capture the evo-
lution of this demand, the Bank has relied on the foreign 
activity measure (FAM), which assigns weights to some 
components of US gross domestic product (GDP) (i .e ., busi-
ness and residential investment and consumption) as well 
as to GDP growth in the rest of the world . In the aftermath 
of the Great Recession, the FAM explained the evolution of 
NCX very well, tracking the decline and recovery in the sec-
tors of the US economy that were especially hard hit during 
the recession and that were also important for Canadian 
NCX . In recent years, however, the NCX growth rate has 
been below that of the FAM, on average . the Bank’s revised 
analytical framework incorporates two potential explana-
tions for this gap: an evolution in the composition of foreign 
demand and structural factors, such as lost export capacity 
and competitiveness challenges .
two approaches to measuring foreign demand have been 
File information 
developed . First, the FAM has been revised to better

investment . the updated measure (FAM-IO) calibrates 
the weights of the various components based on the 2014 
World Input-Output Database .2 Consequently, the weight 
given to US investment is signifi cantly lower, while some 
weight is now attached to US exports and government 
expenditures .  Moreover, the weight of the rest of the world 
triples, better refl ecting the diversifi cation of trade outside 
the US market .
the second approach, called GRACE (which is a measure 
of global real activity for Canadian exports), fl exibly incor-
porates the information contained in a very large number 
of international economic indicators to estimate foreign 
demand .3 In this approach, the determinants of the demand 
for Canada’s goods and services and their importance 
are allowed to evolve through time, albeit slowly . Another 
advantage of GRACE is that it can provide estimates of for-
eign demand for many subaggregates of exports, allowing 
for a richer analysis of Canadian exports .4 
the new measures of foreign demand could explain only 
a small portion of the weakness in NCX, however . this 
implies that export underperformance is also tied to struc-
tural factors, including lost export capacity and factors that 
aﬀ ect competitiveness . to better capture these structural 
factors, the relative price of exports now uses a comprehen-
sive measure of the Canadian eﬀ ective exchange rate5 com-
bined with a proxy for other structural factors, specifi cally, 
the trend of the share of manufacturing output in Canada .
Chart 3-A compares the predictions for NCX using each of 
the new measures of foreign demand (also accounting for 
structural change and competitiveness) with the original 
FAM framework . the predictions using the new framework 
help to better track the past performance of NCX, particu-
larly over the past few years . 

2  the World Input-Output Database is constructed by the European Commission .

Real Activity for Canadian Exports: GRACE,” Bank of Canada Staﬀ  Discussion 
Paper No . 2017-2 (January 2017) .

4  GRACE is estimated for non-commodity and commodity exports, as well as 
for the following subaggregates: services; consumer goods; machinery and 
equipment; motor vehicles and parts; energy products and non-energy com-
modity exports, which can be further decomposed into farm and fi shing; building 
materials; pulp and paper; plastic and rubber; metals; and a residual that includes 
intermediate foods and chemical products .

Taking into account both the new assessment of foreign demand, which is 
expected to grow modestly in the coming years, and the improved measures 
of structural and other competitiveness challenges, total exports are expected 
to increase by about 3 per cent on average over the projection horizon. This 
forecast for exports is similar to that in the October base-case projection, 
which already incorporated judgment based on a preliminary version of the 
revised framework.

The base-case projection assumes that foreign demand will be boosted 
by US fiscal stimulus. The positive impact is, however, dampened by the 
decline in Canadian competiveness associated with assumed corporate tax 
cuts in the United States. Consequently, the projected export profile incor-
porates a modest downward adjustment to reflect this possibility; this initial 
assumption will be revised once concrete policy measures are announced 
and enacted. The base case does not include any protectionist measures 
that may be adopted by the incoming US administration.

Investment will remain solid in the service sector…
Investment in the service sector has underpinned total business invest-
ment in recent years.8 While service sector investment was slow to recover 
from the financial crisis, surpassing its 2007 level only in 2015, it has been 
more resilient than investment in goods-producing industries.9 Looking 
ahead, service sector investment should continue to increase. In particular, 
the winter Business Outlook Survey indicates that intentions to invest in 
machinery and equipment remain widespread among service sector firms.

…but structural factors and uncertainty are restraining 
investment more broadly
The persistent weakness in overall business investment raises the issue of 
whether structural factors, such as declining labour force growth, weaker 
total factor productivity growth and regulatory obstacles, might be playing 
a greater role than previously assumed. Furthermore, the ongoing shift in 
the economy toward the production of services could result not only in a 
different composition of investment but also in a lower share of investment 
in GDP.

In addition, the current high level of uncertainty could be having a greater 
restraining effect on business investment than previously assessed. While 
firms surveyed by the Bank continue to cite insufficient domestic demand 
as the main reason for holding back investment, some also cite uncertainty 
as an obstacle. As well, a number of exporters have indicated that a chal-
lenging competitive environment has encouraged them to maintain or build 
a foreign presence to help meet foreign demand. Future US policies could 
also incite firms to invest in the United States rather than in Canada. 

Since the US fiscal stimulus currently being assumed would include a 
reduction in personal and corporate tax rates, the competitiveness of 
Canadian firms could be adversely affected. Consequently, to reflect this 
possibility, the projected Canadian investment profile incorporates a down-
ward adjustment. This initial assumption will be revised once concrete policy 
measures are announced and enacted by the incoming US administration.

Consumption will be supported by fiscal measures
The Bank anticipates continued solid consumption, supported by accom-
modative monetary policy and higher federal government transfers, despite 
weakness in the energy-intensive provinces associated with the impact of 
the past decline in the terms of trade (Chart 13).

In contrast, residential investment is expected to decline further in the 
coming quarters, making little contribution to overall GDP growth over the 
projection horizon. As a result, the share of residential investment in the 
Canadian economy should gradually ease toward a level closer to historical 
experience (Chart 14).

Mortgage interest rates have increased since October, mainly reflecting 
higher funding costs.10 As in October, the Bank estimates that the impact 
of the federal government’s tighter housing-related measures will subtract 
0.3 per cent from the level of real GDP by the end of 2018.

Financial System Review.

Inflation is expected to move close to 2 per cent
Over the 2017–18 projection horizon, total CPI inflation is expected to be 
close to 2 per cent (Chart 15). The inflationary effect of exchange rate pass-
through is expected to have largely dissipated by early 2017. There will be 
upward pressures on consumer energy prices during 2017, stemming from 
the impact of higher commodity prices and the new regulations related to 
carbon use. This upward pressure is more than offset by the disinflationary 
effect of food prices and excess capacity through most of the year. By 
around mid-2018, inflation is expected to be sustainably at the target as 
excess capacity in the economy dissipates.

Inflation expectations remain well anchored. The January 2017 Consensus 
Economics forecast for total CPI inflation was 1.5 per cent in 2016 and 
2.0 per cent in both 2017 and 2018. Similarly, results from the winter Business 
Outlook Survey indicate that firms’ expectations for inflation over the next 
two years remain within the Bank’s 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control range.

Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, a reasonable range 
around the base-case projection for total CPI inflation is ±0.3 percentage 
points. This range is intended to convey a sense of forecast uncertainty.

Risks to thE inflation outlook  21 

Risks to the inflation outlook

The outlook for inflation is subject to several upside and downside risks 
emanating from both the external environment and the domestic economy. 
Overall, the Bank assesses that the risks to the projected path for inflation 
are roughly balanced, given what is known today. However, the outlook is 
subject to considerable economic and geopolitical uncertainty, including 
that surrounding the policies of the incoming administration in the United 
States. As in past reports, the focus is on a selection of risks identified as 
the most important for the projected path for inflation, drawing from a larger 
set of risks taken into account in the projection.

The evolution of the risks since the previous Report is summarized in 
Table 4. Most of the risks remain relevant. The risk of a broad-based slow-
down in EMEs is now captured under two new risks: a notable shift toward 
protectionist global trade policies and higher global long-term interest rates. 
The risk of higher oil prices has been expanded to include a broader set of 
commodities.

(i)  Stronger real GDP growth in the United States

While the base case incorporates some strengthening of US eco-
nomic growth, resulting in part from anticipated fiscal stimulus, a 
distinctly stronger growth path is also possible. The ongoing recovery, 
together with actual and anticipated policy changes, could trigger 
“animal spirits”—that is, boost business confidence and lead to an 
acceleration in the rate of investment, firm creation and innovation. 
Productivity in the United States may rise by more than expected if 
the persistent weakness in growth includes a larger-than-estimated 
cyclical element, and more discouraged workers may be drawn back 
into the workforce. Additional infrastructure spending, deregulation 
and tax cuts could further strengthen demand and potential output in 
the long run. Stronger US household spending and public and private 
investment would have positive spillovers for Canadian exports.

(ii)  A notable shift toward protectionist global trade policies

While the precise trade policy measures to be taken by the incoming 
US administration remain to be determined, the protectionist tilt is 
already evident. More-negative effects are possible if US measures 
are material, especially if they prompt protectionist responses from 
other economies. Beyond the direct effects on Canadian exports 
and business investment, such policies could weigh on the global 
economy by dampening global trade and economic growth. The 
resulting weaker-than-expected foreign demand would be an addi-
tional drag on Canadian exports and business investment. In a more 

 

 

22  Risks to thE inflation outlook

adverse scenario, the process of globalization—and notably the 
development of global value chains, which has underpinned world 
growth in recent decades—could go into reverse. In such a scenario, 
additional pervasive negative effects on productivity and potential 
growth are possible, in Canada and globally.

(iii)  Higher commodity prices

Risks to commodity prices remain tilted to the upside. If realized, 
these risks would improve Canada’s terms of trade, wealth and 
household spending. Prices of base metals, particularly iron and 
copper, could rise further if infrastructure spending in the United 
States is greater than markets anticipate. There is also some upside 
risk to oil prices, notwithstanding the price gains seen late in 2016. 
Oil-related capital expenditures have sunk globally over the past two 
years, raising the risk that future oil supply could be inadequate to 
meet demand. The degree of upside risk to prices will depend on a 
number of uncertain factors, notably ongoing efficiency gains in pro-
duction at unconventional sources.

(iv)  Sluggish business investment in Canada

The disappointing performance of business investment to date could 
reflect more-sustained structural factors. Over time, weaker business 
investment would also reduce capital deepening and lower poten-
tial output, partially mitigating the disinflationary effect of weaker 
demand.

(v)  Weaker household spending

Given the high level of household indebtedness, households may 
also become more prudent, restraining consumption and housing 
expenditures. Moreover, while recent federal policy changes related to 
housing finance are meant to mitigate the vulnerability associated with 
highly indebted households over time, their adverse near-term impact 
on residential investment could be larger than anticipated. Outsized 
negative effects could occur if the policies were to have a pronounced 
effect on house prices in major centres. Weaker-than-expected 
household spending would have a direct negative impact on real GDP.

(vi)  Higher global long-term interest rates

The recent rise in global bond yields reflects increased optimism 
for growth, inflation and policy rates, partly driven by the expected 
fiscal expansion in the United States. Yet term premiums remain 
compressed by historical standards. While the base case assumes 
term premiums return gradually to normal, there is a possibility of a 
sharp increase. If this were to occur, the upward pressure on bond 
yields could increase capital outflows from EMEs, and financial condi-
tions could tighten further. These developments could translate into a 
decline in activity in sectors sensitive to interest rates, a rise in debt-
service burdens, and weaker global and Canadian growth.

Canada’s Inflation-Control Strategy1
Inflation targeting and the economy
  The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote 

the economic and financial well-being of Canadians.

pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s 
outlook, including risks to the projection, are published four 
times per year in the Monetary Policy Report.

  Canada’s experience with inflation targeting since 1991 has 

shown that the best way to foster confidence in the value 
of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth, 
employment gains and improved living standards is by keeping 
inflation low, stable and predictable.

Inflation targeting is symmetric and flexible
  Canada’s inflation-targeting approach is symmetric, which 

means that the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising 
above or falling below the 2 per cent target.

  In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 

Canada’s inflation-control target for a further five-year period, 
ending December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the 
consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 per cent midpoint 
of the control range of 1 to 3 per cent.

  Canada’s inflation-targeting framework is flexible. Typically, 

the Bank seeks to return inflation to target over a horizon of six 
to eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for 
returning inflation to target will vary depending on the nature 
and persistence of the shocks buffeting the economy.

The monetary policy instrument
  The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes in the 

target for the overnight rate of interest.2 These changes are 
transmitted to the economy through their influence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate, 
which affect total demand for Canadian goods and services. 
The balance between this demand and the economy’s 
production capacity is, over time, the primary determinant of 
inflation pressures in the economy.

  Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight 
quarters—to work their way through the economy and have 
their full effect on inflation. For this reason, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.

  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent com-
munications, the Bank regularly reports its perspective on 
the forces at work on the economy and their implications for 
inflation. The Monetary Policy Report is a key element of this 
approach. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight 

Monitoring inflation
  In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in 
indirect taxes such as GST, can cause sizable fluctuations in 
CPI.

  In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through 

such transitory movements in CPI inflation and focuses on a 
set of “core” inflation measures that better reflect the under-
lying trend of inflation. In this sense, these measures act as an 
operational guide to help the Bank achieve the CPI inflation 
target. They are not a replacement for CPI inflation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core inflation are CPI-
trim, which excludes CPI components whose rates of change 
in a given month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which 
corresponds to the price change located at the 50th percentile 
(in terms of basket weight) of the distribution of price changes; 
and CPI-common, which uses a statistical procedure to track 
common price changes across categories in the CPI basket.

1  See Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target (October 24, 2016) and Renewal of the 

Inflation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.

2  When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide additional  monetary 

stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website, 
describes these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Global Economy

Global economic growth remains solid, with the US economy showing par-
ticular strength. The Bank estimates that growth in US real gross domestic 
product (GDP) in the first half of 2018 was even stronger than expected in 
the April Monetary Policy Report. In other advanced economies, economic 
growth is projected to pick up following temporary softness in the first 
quarter, but with less momentum than anticipated in April. Higher oil prices 
are expected to have a slightly negative net effect on global growth, with the 
impact varying across regions. The Bank expects the global economy will 
grow by about 3 3/4 per cent in 2018 before settling at around 3 1/2 per cent in 
2019, similar to the April projection (Table 1).

Escalating trade tensions pose considerable risks to the outlook. The pro-
jection incorporates actions taken since April by the United States to end 
exemptions on steel and aluminum tariffs for some of its largest trading 
partners and to implement previously announced tariffs on China. It also 
accounts for the ensuing countermeasures. More broadly, this escalation 
has heightened concerns about a more pronounced shift away from a multi-
lateral, rules-based trading system. These concerns could dampen the out-
look for global trade and investment growth (Chart 1). In response to these 
developments, the Bank’s base case now includes the measures that have 
already been implemented. It also considers somewhat greater adverse

effects from uncertainty on investment, both globally and in North America. 
The actions and uncertainty effects are assumed to reduce the level of 
global GDP by 0.2 per cent by the end of 2020.

Global financial conditions remain accommodative
Bond yields remain higher than in 2017 in some regions, reflecting actual 
and expected changes in monetary policy. Monetary policy normaliza-
tion is occurring from different starting points and at different speeds. 
The European Central Bank has announced the conditional conclusion of 
its asset purchase program (quantitative easing) by the end of December 
2018. The economic expansion in the United States is further along than 
it is in other advanced economies and is receiving a sizable boost from 
fiscal policy. The US Federal Reserve has continued to withdraw monetary 
stimulus, and markets are now expecting a faster pace of increases in the 
federal funds rate. Positive market sentiment about the near-term US out-
look has also contributed to an appreciation of the US dollar and portfolio 
outflows from emerging-market economies (EMEs), exacerbating country-
specific vulnerabilities (Chart 2). Equity prices have become more sensitive 
to trade policy developments. Overall, despite recent movements, global 
financial conditions are supportive of economic activity.

The US expansion remains robust
The US economy has been expanding at a solid pace, with recent data sig-
nalling more momentum than anticipated in the April Report. Net exports 
have been unexpectedly robust, reflecting transitory factors, and business 
investment has been more solid than expected. Job gains continue to be 
elevated amid a tight labour market, and indicators of consumer sentiment 
remain high (Chart 3).

The US economy is forecast to expand by 3 per cent in 2018 and 2 1/2 per cent 
in 2019, well above the estimated rate of its potential output growth. Con-
sumption is anticipated to rise at a healthy pace, underpinned by strong 
employment growth, past income tax cuts and elevated household net worth. 
Solid private demand and corporate tax cuts should drive robust business 
investment growth. GDP growth is projected to ease to around 2 per cent in 
2020, close to potential output growth, as fiscal and monetary policy support 
diminishes.

US businesses are starting to report that trade policy uncertainty is damp-
ening an otherwise upbeat outlook for investment, although this is not yet 
evident in the data. The current base-case projection for the US economy 
therefore incorporates some modest adverse effects of trade policy uncer-
tainty on investment.

US core inflation has firmed as the effects of transitory factors, including 
past declines in telecommunication prices, have passed. Wage growth has 
been modest but is expected to pick up with a tightening labour market. 
With stronger wage growth and support from excess demand, core infla-
tion is forecast to remain close to the Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 
2 per cent.

The outlook for growth and inflation is more modest in 
other advanced economies
Growth in the euro area softened at the start of the year, partly reflecting 
labour strikes and some weakness in exports. Recent indicators have been 
mixed, but solid fundamentals will likely support a rebound in the second 
quarter. Growth is expected to slow from 2 1/4 per cent in 2018 to about 
1 1/2 per cent in 2019 and 2020, close to the rate of potential output growth, 
as monetary policy becomes less accommodative. Inflation in the euro area 
remains tepid and is anticipated to rise only gradually. Political develop-
ments have renewed market concerns over fiscal sustainability in the euro 
area, at the same time that uncertainty from trade policy has increased.

Growth in emerging-market economies remains strong 
but with rising risks in some countries
Overall the growth outlook for EMEs remains strong. EMEs have generally 
become more resilient to stress over the past several years. However, both 
Argentina and Turkey have come under acute financial stress since April. 
These developments appear to be related to elevated debt levels and weak-
nesses in their monetary policy frameworks. Growth in oil-importing EMEs 
is forecast to be around 4 1/4 per cent over the projection. Growth in oil-
exporting EMEs is expected to rise as they benefit from higher oil prices.

China’s GDP growth in the first quarter of this year was slower than 
expected in April, largely reflecting a temporary surge in import growth. 
This surge was due, in part, to stock building. While imports have remained 
strong, recent indicators point to a solid rebound in GDP growth. Authorities 
have eased monetary policy to help offset downside risks from a slowdown 
in the pace of credit growth and from trade policy developments that could 
weigh on investor sentiment. Economic growth is still anticipated to mod-
erate from around 6 1/2 per cent in 2018 to around 6 per cent in 2020, as part 
of the continued transition to more sustainable growth.

Oil prices have risen as a result of supply concerns
Crude oil prices have been averaging about 15 per cent higher than 
assumed in the April Report. The increase in prices was partly driven by 
unplanned output declines in Venezuela and sanctions on exports from Iran, 
in a market where demand growth has been healthy and excess inventories 
are being drawn down (Chart 4). US shale drilling has also expanded by less 
than anticipated, reflecting higher costs and pipeline bottlenecks.

Risks to global oil prices are roughly balanced at current price levels. 
An important upside risk is that there could be further disruptions in oil 
supply from Iran and Venezuela. In contrast, production by members of the 
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) could increase 
faster than expected as the previous agreement to reduce output expires. 
The possibility that US shale productivity growth could be stronger than 
expected provides another downside risk to prices. The spreads between 
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western Canada Select (WCS) and 
between Brent and WTI have narrowed recently due to temporary fac-
tors. These spreads are expected to widen again because of transportation 
bottlenecks. The Bank’s convention is to assume that oil prices stay at their 
recent average levels over the projection horizon (Box 1, page 10).

The Bank’s non-energy commodity price index is relatively unchanged 
since April. The prices received by Canadian lumber producers remain high, 
despite the duties imposed by the United States last year, partly as a result 
of brisk US home building. Base metal prices have recently declined as a 
result of the escalation in global trade tensions and market concerns over 
risks to GDP growth in China.

Many commodity-exporting economies, including Canada, have recently 
seen their currencies depreciate despite the rise in oil prices. The typical 
exchange rate appreciation associated with improving terms of trade is 
being offset by the combined effects of the broad-based appreciation of the 
US dollar and of rising trade tensions. Trade developments are important for 
these countries, given their considerable reliance on open trade and global 
economic growth. In this context, the Canadian dollar is assumed to remain 
close to its recent average of 76 cents US, compared with 78 cents US in April.

Canadian Economy

The Canadian economy continues to operate close to full capacity, and GDP 
is expected to expand somewhat faster than potential. The composition of 
growth is shifting: the contribution from household spending is expected to 
be smaller than in 2017 while that from exports and business investment is 
anticipated to be larger.

In the Bank’s projection, economic activity will be supported by continuing 
solid foreign demand and accommodative financial conditions. While invest-
ment and trade are projected to expand, they are being restrained by the 
US tariffs recently imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum imports and 
by uncertainty around trade policies. Since April, uncertainty has increased, 
reflecting delays in the progress of renegotiations of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, as well as the broadening and unknown duration of tariffs.

Real GDP growth is projected to average 2.0 per cent over 2018 to 2020, 
similar to the outlook in the April Report (Table 2). In the first quarter of 
2018, business investment and exports were more robust than anticipated. 
Stronger levels of spending are expected to persist over the projection 
horizon, partly reflecting higher oil prices, even with the larger impacts from 
both trade policy uncertainty and tariffs.

Consumer price index (CPI) inflation has hovered around 2.2 per cent recently. 
It is expected to reach 2.5 per cent in the third and fourth quarters before 
returning to close to 2 per cent in the second half of 2019 as the effects of 
temporary factors fade. Given the importance of temporary factors, it is useful 
to look at the Bank’s measures of core inflation. These measures remain near 
2 per cent, consistent with an economy operating close to capacity.

The composition of GDP growth is shifting
The economy is expected to grow somewhat above its potential in the near 
term. As anticipated, growth was a modest 1.3 per cent in the first quarter 
and is expected to average about 2 per cent over the second and third 
quarters (Table 3 and Chart 5).

The composition of growth has begun to shift away from household 
spending toward business investment and exports. This shift is occur-
ring as households adjust to higher interest rates and tighter mortgage

rules (Guideline B-20).1 Growth of household credit has continued to slow 
and is now below the growth rate of household income; as a result, the 
ratio of household debt to disposable income is edging down (Chart 6). 
Consumption growth has been slowing since the middle of 2017, led by 
a pullback in spending on components sensitive to interest rates.2 While 
Guideline B-20 is improving the credit quality of new mortgages,3 its 
announcement and adoption led to a pull forward of housing resales into 
the fourth quarter of 2017, followed by a sharp drop in the first few months 
of 2018. As a result, residential investment in the first half of 2018 likely con-
tracted. A partial rebound in resales is expected in the third quarter.

Meanwhile, firms are expanding their capacity in the face of solid demand. 
The Bank estimates that business investment and exports were stronger in 
the first half of 2018 than anticipated in the April Report. Spending on com-
puter equipment, software, and research and development was particu-
larly robust. Because the strength of export growth in the first two quarters 
mainly reflected a faster-than-expected rebound in oil exports after tem-
porary pipeline shutdowns in late 2017, export growth in the third quarter is 
expected to slow.

The economy continues to operate near potential, with 
inflation close to 2 per cent
The Bank judges that the output gap in the second quarter of 2018 was 
between -0.5 and +0.5 per cent (Box 1). The Bank has revised its esti-
mates of potential output up modestly since April to reflect a higher level 

1  The revisions to Guideline B-20 were announced by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial 

Institutions in October 2017 and took effect on January 1, 2018. The changes are designed to 
strengthen residential mortgage underwriting practices.

2  Components sensitive to interest rates are vehicle purchases; other transportation services; communi-
cations; furniture; food, beverage and accommodation services; and dwelling maintenance. Moderately 
interest-rate-sensitive components are the operation of transport equipment; recreation and culture; 
clothing and footwear; insurance and financial services; education; and housing user costs.

Box 1

Key inputs to the base-case projection
The Bank’s projection is always conditional on several key 
assumptions, and changes to them will aff ect the outlook 
for the global and Canadian economies . The Bank regularly 
reviews these assumptions and assesses the sensitivity 
of the economic projection to them . The Bank’s current 
assumptions are as follows:
•  Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent average 

levels . The per-barrel prices in US dollars for Brent, West 
Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western Canada Select 
(WCS) have recently averaged close to $75, $70 and 
$50, respectively, about $10 higher than assumed in the 
April Report .

•  By convention, the Bank does not attempt to forecast 

the exchange rate in the base-case projection . Over the 
projection horizon, the Canadian dollar is assumed to 
remain close to its recent average of 76 cents US, com-
pared with 78 cents US in April .

•  The Bank estimates that the output gap was in a range 
of -0 .5 to +0 .5 per cent in the second quarter of 2018 . 
This compares with the April assumption that the output 
gap was in a range of -0 .75 to +0 .25 per cent in the ﬁ rst 
quarter of 2018 .1 The shifting of the range refl ects that 
growth is estimated to have exceeded the pace of poten-
tial output growth in the second quarter .

•  Business investment in the ﬁ rst quarter of 2018 was 
more robust than expected, and this stronger level 
of spending is expected to persist over the projec-
tion horizon, partly refl ecting higher oil prices . The 
annual growth rate of potential output is therefore now 
assumed to be at 1 .8 per cent in 2018 and 1 .9 per cent in

mated range (Table 2) . Details on the Bank’s assessment

•  The neutral nominal policy rate is deﬁ ned as the real rate 

consistent with output sustainably at its potential level 
and infl ation equal to target, on an ongoing basis, plus 
2 per cent for the infl ation target . It is a medium- to long-
term equilibrium concept . For Canada, the neutral policy 
rate is estimated to be between 2 .5 and 3 .5 per cent .2 
The economic projection is based on the midpoint of this 
range, as in the April report .

•  Uncertainty in trade policy has increased further since 

April . For this reason, negative judgment to capture 
trade policy uncertainty reduces the levels of business 
investment and exports by more than was assumed in

of investment from the first quarter of 2018 through the projection horizon. 
Investment could grow faster than anticipated in the base-case projection, 
further raising potential output.

Labour market conditions remain healthy, but growth of employment and 
average hours worked has slowed from last year’s strong pace (Chart 7). 
Likewise, after declining notably in 2017, the unemployment rate to date this 
year has remained relatively steady, near its 40-year low. Firms reported in 
the summer Business Outlook Survey that capacity pressures and labour 
shortages have intensified (Chart 8). Nevertheless, there are areas where 
labour market slack remains—especially in the energy-producing regions. 
The recent uptick in the labour force participation rate indicates that addi-
tional people may be willing to work. As well, the long-term unemployment

rate is still relatively high, and the participation rate in the youth labour 
market remains subdued. Against this backdrop, underlying wage growth 
remains close to 2.3 per cent, indicating less wage pressure than would be 
expected in a labour market with no slack.4, 5

4  Measures of wage growth have diverged recently. The wage measure from the Labour Force Survey 
grew at a relatively strong pace of 3.6 per cent between June 2017 and June 2018. Recent releases 
of other wage measures from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours; the National Accounts; 
and the Productivity Accounts indicate that they have grown at a slower pace, in a range of 1.9 to 
2.1 per cent. 

5  The Bank constructs a wage measure that better captures underlying wage pressures and reflects the 

common trend across the alternative measures of labour compensation. For details on this measure, 
known as the “wage-common,” see D. Brouillette, J. Lachaine and B. Vincent, “Wages: Measurement

Last observation: May 2018

Consistent with an economy operating near potential, core inflation meas-
ures remain close to 2 per cent (Chart 9). CPI inflation is slightly above 
2 per cent, mainly reflecting temporary upward pressures from increases 
in gasoline prices and in the prices of services affected by recent rises in 
minimum wages.6

GDP growth is expected to average 2 per cent, but the 
outlook is clouded by trade issues
The Bank expects that GDP will grow somewhat faster than potential 
output over the projection horizon. Consumption should be supported by 
solid gains in real gross domestic income. The combined contribution to 
growth of exports and investment will continue to be better than in recent 
years, even after incorporating the restraining effects of the US tariffs and 
the Canadian countermeasures (Box 2). Growth of government spending is 
projected to slow in 2019 and 2020 relative to the previous two years as the 
effects of the 2016 federal budget stimulus gradually dissipate.7 

Following the Bank’s recent practice, the base-case projection incorpor-
ates the impact of trade policy uncertainty (Box 1), as well as the effects of 
implemented tariffs (Table 4). These tariffs include previously imposed US 
tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber and newsprint, the new US tariffs on 
steel and aluminum imports from Canada, and Canadian countermeasures. 
The dampening effects associated with trade policy uncertainty and the 
implemented US tariffs subtract about 2/3 per cent from the level of GDP by 
the end of 2020. While this drag is larger than in the April Report, the incre-
mental drag on projected GDP roughly balances the positive impact of 
higher oil prices.

6  The prices of certain services, such as restaurants; child care and housekeeping; and personal care 

services, have increased sharply in Ontario since the start of the year. 

7  By convention, only announced federal and provincial budgets are incorporated into the projection for 

government spending. Without a budget from the new provincial government in Ontario, the assump-
tion for spending by the Ontario government is unchanged from the April Report.

 
 

Box 2

The economic impact of the recent steel and aluminum tariﬀ s
On May 31, the US administration announced the end of 
tariff  exemptions granted to Canada on steel and aluminum 
imports . On June 1, it began to levy tariff s of 25 per cent 
and 10 per cent, respectively, on imports of these products 
from Canada . The value of exports now subject to the US 
tariff s was $16 .6 billion in 2017, about 2 .5 per cent of total 
Canadian exports . Together, the primary steel and alum-
inum sectors represent about 0 .5 per cent of Canadian GDP 
and directly account for around 35,000 jobs .
In response to these measures, the Government of Canada 
imposed tariff s on imports from the United States worth 
$16 .6 billion, mainly on aluminum, iron and steel products, as 
well as various consumer products .1 These countermeasures 
took eff ect on July 1 . The federal government also announced 
that it would make available up to $2 billion to support 
Canadian workers and businesses in the steel, aluminum 
and manufacturing industries .

Impact of the US tariﬀ s
The Bank estimates that the US tariff s on steel and alum-
inum will reduce the level of real Canadian exports by 
$3 .6 billion, or about 0 .6 per cent (Table 2-A) . The impact 
of the tariff s on export growth is expected to be felt mostly 
in the second half of 2018; however, discussions with 
industry representatives indicate that the eff ects could take 
longer to materialize .
The size and timing of the eff ects will depend on multiple 
factors, including the capacity of Canadian exporters to 
absorb the tariff  costs or to pass them on to their US cus-
tomers . The ability of both Canadian exporters and US 
importers to ﬁ nd new trading partners is an additional 
factor . Impacts would be felt by ﬁ rms directly aff ected by 
the tariff s, as well as by ﬁ rms in their supply chain . The Bank 
also expects ﬁ rms’ plans to invest in Canada and Canadian 
workers’ incomes to be negatively aff ected . Government 
support could mitigate some of these challenges .

Impact of the Canadian countermeasures
Canada’s tariff s are estimated to reduce real imports by 
$3 .9 billion, or about 0 .6 per cent, starting in the third 
quarter of 2018 . They are also likely to have complex eff ects 
on other sectors of the Canadian economy, notably through 
higher costs for users of steel, iron and aluminum, as well as 
for ﬁ rms using other items made from these products .
These tariff s are expected to put upward pressure on con-
sumer prices, which would temporarily boost consumer 
price index (CPI) infl ation by about 0 .1 percentage point 
until the third quarter of 2019 .2 Consumers’ purchasing 
power would be reduced, which would weigh on household 
spending . However, potential mitigants to the direct price 
eff ects of the tariff s include Canadian importers ﬁ nding 
suppliers outside the United States .
The Bank estimates that trade uncertainty and US trade 
actions already implemented will subtract about 2/3 per 
cent from GDP by the end of 2020 . The Bank will continue 
to closely monitor the implications of these US tariff s and 
Canadian countermeasures, especially given the level of 
uncertainty around the size and timing of the eff ects .

2  The consumer products subject to the countermeasures represent about 1 per 

cent of the CPI basket of goods and services, mostly in three components: house-
hold operations, furnishings and equipment; recreation, education and reading; 
and food . This number is calculated as a weighted sum of the estimated shares of 
the CPI components that are imported from the United States and subject to the 
Canadian tariff s, using CPI weights . Data are from Statistics Canada’s supply and 
use tables and from the Canadian International Merchandise Trade Database .

Household spending is expected to grow moderately
Consumer spending is expected to provide less support to GDP growth 
than in 2017. The contribution of residential investment is expected to be 
small in 2018 and to subsequently decline. The decline is driven by tighter 
mortgage rules and higher interest rates.

The sensitivity of consumption and housing to interest rates is estimated to 
be larger than in past cycles, given the elevated ratio of household debt to 
disposable income. The impact of higher interest rates likely differs across 
categories of borrowers, with highly indebted households the most affected 
(Box 3).

Consumption growth is expected to be supported by a pickup in wage 
growth and an improvement in Canada’s terms of trade resulting from higher 
oil prices. However, growth in consumer spending is anticipated to be tem-
pered by a modest slowdown in the growth of total hours worked and by the 
revisions to mortgage rules. The revised rules may prompt some households 
to save more so that they can pass the tighter mortgage stress tests.

Residential investment is slowing, reflecting the effects of higher interest 
rates and tighter mortgage rules. Resale activity contracted when the 
revised measures went into effect but is anticipated to improve over the 
next few quarters. Data on resale activity and housing starts suggest that 
the housing market is beginning to stabilize. Growth of new construction 
spending is expected to slow over the projection horizon. The new mortgage 
measures may cause households to purchase less-expensive residences 
because typical homebuyers are now more constrained in how much they 
can borrow.

When interest rates started to increase in 2017, the Canadian 
debt-to-income ratio was at a record high . Recently, the ratio 
has declined slightly, but it remains elevated . For this reason, 
consumption is likely more sensitive to interest rate increases 
than in the past, although the impact of rate increases will 
vary across categories of borrowers .
Mortgage holders have likely beneﬁ ted from rising nominal 
income since ﬁ rst taking out their mortgages . Over time, 
the share of their income going to mortgage payments 
would have become smaller, possibly allowing for additional 
consumption . However, higher interest rates generally 
require higher payments, which would off set the previous 
income gains and constrain households’ ability to spend . 
Holders of variable-rate mortgages will see their borrowing 
costs rise in line with the interest rate increases .1 Currently, 
about one-quarter of outstanding mortgages have a vari-
able rate . The impact on holders of ﬁ xed-rate mortgages 
will be delayed, since the eff ects of higher rates will be felt 
only when they renew their mortgages .

The potential impact for households renewing ﬁ xed-rate 
mortgages can be quantiﬁ ed using micro data2 on all 5-year 
ﬁ xed-rate mortgages issued in 2014 and in 2015 (i .e ., mort-
gages that will be renewed in 2019 and in 2020) .3 To illustrate, 
mortgage debt-service ratios (MDSRs), deﬁ ned as the ratio 
of annual mortgage payments to annual income, are calcu-
lated for interest rates in 2019 and 2020 that are 100 and 
200 basis points higher, respectively . In addition, incomes are 
assumed to grow by 11 per cent over each 5-year period .4
Chart 3-A shows the MDSRs at three diff erent stages: at 
origination, over the 5-year ﬁ xed-rate term and at renewal .5 
Since mortgage payments are ﬁ xed for the term of the loan, 
the MDSR declines over time as nominal income rises in

Vulnerabilities Using Loan-Level Mortgage Data,” Bank of Canada Financial System 
Review (November 2017): 21–33 .

3  These cohorts of borrowers represent just under 10 per cent of all Canadian 

households . 

1  Many borrowers with variable-rate mortgages have contracts that ﬁ x the monthly 
payment, which causes the principal payment to adjust when rates change . When 
rates increase, ﬁ xed payments would enable borrowers to maintain their con-
sumption spending plans by delaying paying down debt .

4  This is the growth rate of nominal income per worker over the 5-year period 

ending in the fourth quarter of 2017 .

5  These calculations assume that ﬁ xed-rate borrowers do not extend their amortiz-

ation period to mitigate higher debt-service costs .

the second stage . However, when interest rates increase 
at renewal, the reduced MDSRs from income gains experi-
enced over the past ﬁ ve years are erased . For mortgages 
renewing in 2020, MDSRs are higher than at origination, 
particularly for highly indebted borrowers .

These estimates of the impact of higher interest rates are in 
line with interest rate sensitivities embedded in the Bank’s 
macroeconomic projections for household disposable 
income and consumption .

Solid demand is expected to support investment despite 
elevated trade policy uncertainty
Business investment is expected to expand at a modest pace following the 
strong growth observed since the beginning of 2017. Firms in all regions 
expect capacity pressures to intensify (Chart 10). However, exporting firms 
and their domestic suppliers are anticipated to delay or reduce investment 
spending because of increasing trade policy uncertainty.

In many sectors, moderate investment growth is expected as firms antici-
pating solid growth in domestic and foreign demand and capacity pressures 
increase their capital expenditures. Capacity utilization rates have been 
rising and are near post-2003 highs in many industries.8

In the mining, oil and gas sector, higher prices should provide an incen-
tive to increase investment. Sentiment has been improving with the higher 
oil prices and indications of progress toward addressing shortages of 
pipeline capacity. However, with transportation constraints persisting for 
oil in Western Canada, spending to expand production is expected to be 
restrained in the near term.

Export growth is expected to increase despite trade and 
competitiveness challenges 
Export growth is expected to increase over the projection horizon, sup-
ported mainly by solid foreign demand growth and higher oil prices 
(Chart 11). The outlook would have been stronger were it not for the recently 
imposed tariffs and increased uncertainty associated with global trade poli-
cies. Growth prospects differ across sectors, in part because of the varying 
intensity of capacity constraints faced by firms.

Tariffs imposed by the US administration on imports of steel and aluminum 
from Canada are expected to subtract about 0.6 per cent from Canadian 
exports. Likewise, tariffs imposed by Canada on certain products imported 
from the United States are expected to subtract 0.6 per cent from Canadian 
imports (Box 2).

Buoyed by strong foreign demand, sectors that are planning to increase 
capital expenditures to expand capacity or innovate, such as machinery 
manufacturing and services, are expected to boost their exports.9 Some 
sectors will likely continue to face capacity constraints. Exports of many 
commodities, for example, are currently limited by transportation bottle-
necks due to rail car shortages. These shortages are expected to abate over 
the coming year. Food manufacturing is also struggling with physical cap-
acity issues, while difficulties recruiting skilled labour are more frequently 
reported by firms specializing in information and technology, industrial 
machinery, equipment and parts, and research and development.10

The Bank continues to assume that competitiveness challenges will restrain 
export growth over the forecast horizon. This follows losses of competitive-
ness in recent years that were experienced in all categories of non-energy 
exports.11

Growth of imports is expected to slow over the projection horizon, con-
sistent with the moderation in the growth rate of final domestic demand and 
the tariffs imposed by Canada on certain US products.

Inflation is expected to be above 2 per cent temporarily
CPI inflation is projected to rise temporarily, reaching 2.5 per cent in the 
third and fourth quarters of 2018 before returning to about 2 per cent 
(Chart 12). Inflation is expected to be higher than 2 per cent owing to higher 
gasoline prices in recent months, the impact of minimum wage increases, 
newly imposed tariffs and exchange rate pass-through. The Bank estimates 
that tariffs levied by Canada on some products imported from the United 
States will temporarily boost inflation by about 0.1 percentage point (Box 2). 
Once prices have fully adjusted to incorporate the effects of these factors, 
the associated upward pressures on inflation will fade. Low food price infla-
tion is expected to have a negative effect on CPI inflation until the first half 
of 2019. CPI inflation is expected to be close to 2 per cent from mid-2019 
through the end of the projection horizon.

The base-case projection provides the Bank’s view of the most likely out-
come for inflation. Any projection is subject to considerable forecast uncer-
tainty. A 90 per cent confidence band around the inflation projection widens 
from ±0.6 percentage points in the third quarter of 2018 to ±1.5 percentage 
points by the end of 2020.

The projection is consistent with medium- and long-term inflation expecta-
tions remaining well anchored. Most respondents to the summer Business 
Outlook Survey anticipate that inflation will remain within the Bank’s target 
range of 1 to 3 per cent over the next two years. The majority expect infla-
tion to be in the upper half of that range, consistent with the Bank’s pro-
jection. The June 2018 Consensus Economics forecast for CPI inflation is 
2.3 per cent in 2018 and 2.0 per cent in 2019, with long-term annual inflation 
expectations averaging 2.0 per cent through 2028.

most important source of uncertainty surrounding the outlook. Related 
risks have broadened and intensified, although some aspects of these risks 
have been partially realized with the imposition of tariffs by the US admin-
istration and countermeasures by other countries. With respect to bilateral 
trade arrangements between the United States and Canada, the base-case 
projection incorporates the effects of the US tariffs on steel and aluminum 
imports from Canada and Canadian countermeasures. It also incorporates 
the effects of previously imposed US tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber 
and newsprint and those of trade policy uncertainty.

It is impossible to fully quantify the possible outcomes associated with 
changing trade policies without clarity about the actual measures and their 
timing. The range of possibilities is wide, and the channels through which 
the measures would affect the economy are complex.

In this context, the Bank assesses that the risks to the projected path for 
inflation are roughly balanced. As in past reports, the focus is on a selec-
tion of risks identified as the most important for the projected path for infla-
tion, drawing from a larger set of risks accounted for in the projection. The 
evolution of risks since April is summarized in Table 5. The risk of weaker 
Canadian exports and investment has intensified since April.

(i)  Weaker Canadian investment and exports

A broadening of US tariffs could pose a significant risk to Canadian 
economic activity. While the primary channel for such trade policy 
actions would be through reduced exports and imports, additional 
channels of transmission could be important. For industries that 
comprise a relatively large share of Canadian exports and with highly 
integrated cross-border supply chains, such as the auto sector, tariffs 
would have large impacts on investment and employment. Adverse 
effects on business and consumer confidence could lead to large 
negative spillovers on household spending and on business invest-
ment in other sectors of the economy. Moreover, an overall reduction 
in investment and dislocation of global value chains would have nega-
tive effects on productivity and potential growth. These effects would 
be mitigated by a depreciation of the Canadian dollar and possibly 
by government measures to support affected industries and workers. 
The direct effect of tariffs and exchange rate pass-through would 
immediately result in higher prices for some goods and reduce con-
sumer purchasing power. In an economy already operating at cap-
acity, this could lead to demands for higher wage increases and, in 
turn, put upward pressure on prices. In addition, there are two-sided

effects associated with the demand and supply implications of the 
tariffs. Weaker aggregate demand would weigh on price inflation, 
although reductions to potential output would work in the opposite 
direction.

(ii)  Sharp tightening of global financial conditions

Global financial conditions remain broadly accommodative, but could 
tighten suddenly. Further escalation of trade tensions, a faster-than-
anticipated pickup in wage and price inflation, or significant increases 
in expectations of the future path of monetary policy could lead to 
higher term premiums and equity risk premiums. If premiums were 
to rise, the higher bond yields could increase capital outflows from 
EMEs, exacerbating country-specific vulnerabilities in some cases, 
and financial conditions could tighten further. These developments 
could translate into a decline in activity in sectors sensitive to interest 
rates, a rise in debt-service burdens, weaker global and Canadian 
growth, and a decline in commodity prices.

(iii)  Stronger real GDP growth in the United States

The outlook for US GDP growth in 2018 has been revised up following 
signs in recent data of greater-than-expected strength. However, 
growth over the projection horizon could be stronger if trade-related 
uncertainty diminishes or tax reform and deregulation trigger animal 
spirits. The resulting boost to investment, as well as stronger house-
hold spending, would have positive implications for Canadian invest-
ment and exports.

(iv)  Stronger consumption and rising household debt in Canada
While consumption has been weaker than expected in the first quarter 
of 2018, persistently elevated consumer confidence could lead to 
even stronger consumer spending, with a savings rate that falls below 
the relatively high level embedded in the projection. The vulnerabilities 
associated with household indebtedness would be exacerbated if the 
additional spending were financed by more borrowing.

(v)  A pronounced decline in house prices in overheated markets 

in Canada
While there has been some moderation in price growth and less 
speculative demand in the single-family home segment, prices for 
condominiums have continued to increase rapidly in some markets. 
Thus, there remains a risk of a sharp decline in house prices in over-
heated markets, which would likely dampen residential investment 
and consumption.

Canada’s infl ation-control strategy
Canada’s infl ation-control strategy
Infl ation targeting and the economy
  The objective of Canada’s monetary policy is to promote the 

economic and fi nancial well-being of Canadians. Canada’s 
experience with infl ation targeting since 1991 has shown that the 
best way that monetary policy can achieve this goal is by maintaining 
a low and stable infl ation environment. Doing so fosters confi dence 
in the value of money and contributes to sustained economic growth, 
a strong and inclusive labour market and improved living standards.
In 2021, the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada 
renewed the fl exible infl ation-targeting strategy of the monetary policy 
framework for a further fi ve-year period, ending December 31, 2026.1 
  The infl ation target was renewed at the 2% midpoint of the 1%–3% 

 

control range, with infl ation measured as the 12-month rate of 
change in the consumer price index (CPI). 

  The Government and the Bank agreed that the best contribution 

monetary policy can make to the economic and fi nancial 
well-being of Canadians is to continue to focus on price stability. 
The Government and the Bank also agreed that monetary policy 
should continue to support maximum sustainable employment, 
recognizing that maximum sustainable employment is not directly 
measurable and is determined largely by non-monetary factors 
that can change through time. 

  Further, the Government and the Bank agreed that because well-
anchored infl ation expectations are critical to achieving both price 
stability and maximum sustainable employment, the primary objective 
of monetary policy is to maintain low, stable infl ation over time. 

Infl ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible
  Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means 

the Bank is equally concerned about infl ation rising above or falling 
below the 2% target. 

  Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is also ﬂ exible. Typically, 

the Bank seeks to return infl ation to target over a horizon of six to 
eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning 
infl ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence 
of the shocks buffeting the economy.

  The 2021 agreement with the Government specifi es that the 2% 

infl ation target remains the cornerstone of the framework. 

  The agreement further notes that the Bank will continue to use the 

fl exibility of the 1%–3% control range to actively seek the maximum 
sustainable level of employment, when conditions warrant. The Bank 
will also continue to leverage the fl exibility inherent in the framework 
to help address the challenges of structurally low interest rates by 
using a broad set of policy tools. The Bank will use this fl exibility only 
to an extent that is consistent with keeping medium-term infl ation 
expectations well anchored at 2%.

Monetary policy tools
  Because monetary policy actions take time to work their way through 

the economy and have their full effect on infl ation, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.

  The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes 
in the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate). The 
Bank also has a range of monetary policy tools it can use when the 
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on 
the future evolution of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases 
(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures, 
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these 
tools would depend on the economic and fi nancial market context.

  All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for 

Canadian goods and services through their infl uence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The 
balance between this demand and the economy’s production 
capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl ation 
pressures in the economy.

Communications
  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent communications, 

the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the economy and 
infl ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight pre-set 
days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s outlook are 
published four times each year in the Monetary Policy Report.

  The Bank is committed to explaining when it is using the fl exibility of 

the infl ation-targeting strategy.

  Given the uncertainty about the maximum sustainable level of 

employment, the Bank will consider a broad range of labour market 
indicators.2 The Bank will also systematically report to Canadians on 
how labour market outcomes have factored into its policy decisions.

Monitoring infl ation
 

 

In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile and can cause sizable fl uctuations in CPI infl ation.
In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such 
transitory movements in CPI infl ation and focuses on a set of “core” 
infl ation measures that better refl ect the underlying trend of infl ation. 
In this sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the 
Bank achieve the CPI infl ation target. They are not a replacement for 
CPI infl ation.

  The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl ation are CPI-trim, 
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given 
month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which corresponds to 
the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket 
weight) of the distribution of price changes; and CPI-common, which 
uses a statistical procedure to track common price changes across 
categories in the CPI basket.

Overview
Overview

Inflation around the world remains high and broad-based, despite falling 
commodity prices and evidence that supply challenges are gradually easing.

In response, many central banks have been rapidly increasing their policy rates. 
Global growth is slowing sharply due to the associated tightening in financial 
conditions worldwide, as well as the acute energy shortages and ongoing 
uncertainty because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Financial stresses have 
increased.

The Bank of Canada has been raising its policy interest rate to slow demand 
growth, anchor inflation expectations and bring inflation down. Slower domestic 
and foreign demand, lower commodity prices and the fading impact of global 
supply disruptions will reduce price pressures over the projection horizon. 
Inflation is expected to return to the top of the 1%–3% control range by the end of 
2023 and to the 2% target by the end of 2024.

Key messages
  While inflation in Canada has declined from its peak, largely due to lower 

gasoline prices, it is still too high, and underlying inflationary pressures remain 
elevated.

  The Canadian economy continues to operate with significant excess demand. 

Businesses are facing widespread labour shortages and continuing tight 
labour markets.

  Monetary policy is beginning to help rebalance supply and demand in the 

economy. Financial conditions have become more restrictive following a series 
of interest rate hikes. Firms’ investment and hiring plans are softening. Higher 
mortgage rates have led to significant declines in housing activity. Household 
spending on goods is slowing, and, as the effects of higher interest rates 
continue to work through the economy, spending on services is also expected 
to moderate. 

  The pace of economic growth in Canada is slowing and is expected to 

moderate further. Growth is projected to essentially stall later this year and 
through the first half of 2023. Reducing demand growth in the economy allows 
supply to catch up, bringing inflation down.

  Growth in gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to decline from about 

3¼% in 2022 to just under 1% in 2023. It then picks up modestly, reaching 2% 
in 2024. 

  Inflation is projected to ease as the economy responds to higher interest rates 
and as the effects of elevated commodity prices and supply disruptions fade. 
The Bank expects inflation to decline to around 3% in late 2023 and return to 
2% by the end of 2024.

GLOBAL ECONOMy  2 

Global economy
Global economy

Inflation has continued to rise across the world this past year, reaching 
highs that have not been seen for decades. Many central banks have swiftly 
raised their policy rates in response. Although commodity prices are well 
below their peak from earlier this year and inflationary pressures from supply 
challenges have recently subsided, underlying inflation has yet to ease in 
many countries. 

The tightening of global monetary and financial conditions and Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine are weighing on business and consumer confidence as 
well as on economic activity around the world. The Bank is expecting a sharp 
slowdown in the global economy. In the United States, growth in household 
spending and investment has fallen markedly. These are important drivers 
of demand for Canadian exports. In the euro area, economic activity is 
expected to have started contracting in the second half of 2022 due to energy 
shortages and elevated uncertainty. While economic activity in China is 
recovering from the most recent round of lockdowns related to the COVID-19 
pandemic, the correction in China’s property sector continues to restrain 
growth. 

The rapid rise in US policy interest rates and the surge in the US dollar have 
both caused important spillovers onto global financial conditions. Debt-
servicing costs for many emerging-market economies (EMEs) are increasing, 
with some developing economies facing challenges servicing their debt. The 
appreciation of the US dollar also adds to inflationary pressures in many 
countries. 

Overall, the Bank of Canada projects global growth to decline from roughly 
3¼% in 2022 to about 1½% in 2023. This would mark the slowest rate 
of global growth since 1982, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic and the 
2008–09 global financial crisis. Growth is projected to pick up to around 
2½% in 2024, mainly as the effects of tighter monetary policy and financial 
conditions abate. 

Globally, inflation is expected to decline in 2024 to levels that are close to 
central banks’ targets. Lower commodity prices, easing supply challenges 
and slower demand growth due to monetary policy tightening are expected to 
reduce inflation over the projection horizon.

Compared with projections in the July Report, growth in regions important 
for the Canadian economy—such as the United States, the euro area and 
China—has been revised down significantly (Table 1 and Box 1).1

released.

Changes to the economic projection since the July Report 
Global outlook
Since the July Report, economic growth has been 
revised down in regions of the world that are particularly 
important for the Canadian outlook: 

  In the United States, economic growth has been 
reduced markedly in 2023 and modestly in 2024. 
The main driver of this downward revision is tighter 
fi nancial conditions.

  In the euro area, economic growth has been revised 

down substantially in 2023 and 2024 due to new 
disruptions to energy supply, lower real incomes and 
the need for higher policy rates to combat increased 
infl ationary pressures.

  In China, the negative impacts of COVID-19 

lockdowns and the property market correction have 
been larger than expected, leaving growth lower 
throughout the projection horizon. 

On net, growth of global gross domestic product (GDP) 
is roughly ½   a percentage point lower in 2023 and 2024 
compared with the July Report. Global infl ation has 
been revised up marginally by the end of the projection 
horizon, mainly due to stronger projected infl ation in the 
euro area.

Canadian outlook 
GDP growth in 2022 has been revised down by about 
¼ of a percentage point, to around 3¼%. It has been 
reduced by close to 1 percentage point in 2023 and 
almost ½ of a percentage point in 2024, to about 1% and 
2%, respectively. These revisions leave the level of real 
GDP about 1½% lower by the end of 2024.

The following factors explain the downward revisions to 
the outlook for economic growth: 

  Potential output growth has been revised down. 
The negative effects of supply chain disruptions 
on productivity and of labour market mismatch that 
were previously assumed to be temporary are now 
assumed to be permanent. Higher net immigration 
partially offsets this downward revision (see Box 4 
on page 21).

  Financial conditions are tighter, and wealth is 

lower than expected. Household spending has 
consequently been revised down. 

  Exports have been revised down because of a lower 

path for commodity prices and a weaker projection 
for foreign demand. The depreciation of the 
Canadian dollar partially offsets these effects.

(continued…)

GLOBAL ECONOMy  4 

Box 1 (continued)

  Business investment is anticipated to be lower due 

to tighter-than-expected fi nancial conditions, weaker 
foreign demand and the recent depreciation of the 
Canadian dollar, which raises the price in Canadian 
dollars of imported machinery and equipment.

Consumer price index (CPI) infl ation in 2022 and 2023 
is anticipated to be lower than previously projected. The 
outlook for CPI infl ation has been revised down by ¼ of 
a percentage point to just under 7% in 2022 and by ½ of 

a percentage point to about 4% in 2023. The outlook for 
infl ation in 2024 is largely unchanged. The downward 
revisions are mainly due to lower gasoline prices and 
weaker demand. Easing global cost pressures, including 
lower-than-expected shipping costs, also contribute to 
reducing infl ation in 2023. The weaker Canadian dollar 
partially offsets these cost pressures.

Broad-based inflation
Much of the world is experiencing high inflation (Chart 1). However, price 
increases have recently slowed due to declines in commodity prices. 
Moreover, pressures on inflation for prices of durable goods have lessened. 
This easing is partly due to lower transportation costs between Asia and 
other continents (Chart 2). As well, supplier delivery times are showing signs 
of normalizing. Despite these developments, underlying inflation remains 
elevated.

The sources and intensity of inflationary pressures differ significantly across 
regions: 

  In the United States, measures of near-term inflation expectations have 

fallen slightly but are still considerably higher than the Federal Reserve’s 
inflation target. Moreover, rates of job openings, separations, quits and 
unemployment continue to signal a tight labour market, with employment 
gains outpacing growth in the working-age population. Wages continue to 
rise rapidly. 

  In the euro area, inflation is high and broadening across categories. 
Energy shortages are the main factor behind inflationary pressures, 
particularly after Russia further restricted natural gas exports. A tight 
labour market is also a factor, but it plays a smaller role. 

  Elevated commodity prices have added to inflation worldwide. The 
appreciation of the US dollar is contributing to imported inflation in 
countries that have seen their currencies depreciate.2

The Bank forecasts that inflation globally will decline steadily. The tightening 
in financial conditions plays an important role in reducing demand growth and 
inflation over the projection. 

2 

In the United States, by contrast, many imported goods are priced in US dollars. As a result, the pass-
through effects of a currency appreciation tend to appear only partially and do so gradually over time. 

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLiCy REPORT  •  OCTOBER 2022

GLOBAL ECONOMy  6 

Tightening financial conditions and rising US dollar 
Global financial conditions are markedly more restrictive than they were 
at the time of the July Report largely because many central banks have 
continued to tighten monetary policy.3 Global government bond yields have 
climbed quickly since the beginning of the year, leading to a repricing in 
global equities and other risky assets. The rapid rise in US interest rates 
and safe-haven flows resulting from concerns about a global recession have 
contributed to a substantial appreciation of the US dollar (Chart 3). While 
the Canadian dollar held steady against its US counterpart for most of the 
year, it has depreciated recently. The economic projection assumes the 
Canadian dollar will remain close to its average of around 74 cents US since 
September, 4 cents lower than assumed in July (Box 2).
As central banks in many countries raise their policy rates to address 
inflationary pressures, abrupt movements in risky asset prices and increased 
liquidity needs could occur. Financial vulnerabilities that have been building 
for some time—including high indebtedness and stretched asset valuations—
could magnify the impact of global tightening. Moreover, a higher US dollar 
could amplify funding problems faced by some EMEs that have borrowed 
extensively in that currency.

Further moderation in US activity
Economic activity in the United States is slowly expanding after having 
contracted over the first half of the year. Overall, GDP in 2022 is forecast 
to grow by roughly 1¾%. Components of US activity that are important for 
Canadian exports are anticipated to weaken further over the projection horizon. 

3  Since the start of 2022, the US Federal Reserve has increased the target range of the federal funds 

rate by 300 basis points and has started to reduce its balance sheet. The European Central Bank has 
increased the deposit facility rate by 125 basis points over the same period. Both central banks have 
communicated that they will likely implement further interest rate hikes. 

 
 

Box 2

Key inputs to the projection
The Bank of Canada’s projection is conditional on 
several key assumptions, and changes to these will 
affect the outlook for the Canadian economy. The Bank 
regularly reviews these assumptions and how they may 
impact the economic projection. The key inputs into the 
Bank’s projection are as follows:

  In Canada, almost all public health restrictions 

have been lifted, and pandemic-related effects on 
consumer demand are assumed to have dissipated. 
Moreover, the Bank now assumes that households 
are consuming from their stock of extra savings 
accumulated during the pandemic as they would 
from their other savings.

  The projection incorporates information from all 

provincial and federal budgets available at the time 
of writing.

  Oil prices have declined since the July Report. The 

per-barrel prices in US dollars are assumed to be 
$95 for Brent, $90 for West Texas Intermediate and 
$75 for Western Canadian Select. Prices in the 
fourth quarter are US$15 lower than assumed in July 
but are only US$5 lower by the end of the projection 
(Chart 2-A). The risk of price movements in either 
direction is viewed as roughly balanced. 

  By convention, the Bank does not forecast the 
exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. 
The Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at 
74 cents US over the projection horizon, close to its 
recent average and below the 78 cents US assumed 
in the July Report.

  With this Report, the Bank is ending its distinction 

between supply and potential output. The Bank 
made that distinction in recent Reports to account 
for the episodic nature of some supply decreases 
caused by pandemic-related factors. With most 
public health restrictions removed, this distinction is 
no longer meaningful. It is therefore appropriate to 
now interpret assumptions about potential output as 
also refl ecting the expected evolution of supply. The 
difference between real gross domestic product and 
potential output refl ects the output gap.

  Potential output growth in Canada is assumed to 

increase from about ¾% in 2022 to just over 2% in 
2023 and 2024. These growth rates are slower than 
assumed for the growth of supply in the July Report, 
leaving the level of potential output at the end of 
2024 about 1½% lower than the level of supply in the 
July Report. For more details on the Bank’s potential 
output growth projection and revisions, see Box 4 
on page 21.

  The Bank estimates that the output gap was 

between 0.25% and 1.25% in the third quarter of 
2022, similar to the estimate for the second quarter 
provided in the July Report. 

  The nominal neutral policy interest rate is defi ned as 

the real neutral rate plus 2% for infl ation. The real 
neutral rate is defi ned as the rate consistent with 
both output remaining sustainably at its potential and 
infl ation remaining at target, on an ongoing basis. It 
is a medium- to long-term equilibrium concept. For 
Canada, the projection assumes that the nominal 
neutral rate is at the midpoint of the estimated range 
of 2% to 3%. This range was last reassessed in the 
April 2022 Report.

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLiCy REPORT  •  OCTOBER 2022

GLOBAL ECONOMy  8 

Consumption growth wanes as demand for in-person services stabilizes and 
household budgets are squeezed by high inflation and rising interest rates. 
Together, the slowdown in domestic demand and tighter borrowing conditions 
are projected to hamper business investment and industrial production. These 
factors are expected to dampen US output in 2023 before growth picks up over 
2024.

Multiple headwinds in the euro area 
In the euro area, activity is forecast to contract through the first quarter of 
2023. The decline is mainly driven by severe supply disruptions caused by 
Russian restrictions of natural gas exports and other shortages related to 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Tighter monetary policy and lower confidence 
also dampen demand growth over the projection.

GDP is projected to grow around 3% in 2022 but to contract ½% in 2023. 
While a modest rebound is expected in 2024, the outlook remains highly 
uncertain.

Property market stress in China 
As the most severe effects of pandemic-related lockdowns fade, China’s 
economy appears to have partially rebounded. Activity is forecast to pick 
up further as the manufacturing sector recovers and in-person activities 
gradually resume. Containment measures in China are assumed to become 
less frequent and more targeted over the remainder of 2022 and 2023. 
Ongoing challenges related to its property market will continue to weigh on 
growth. 

Risks to economic activity are tilted to the downside. Authorities face a 
delicate balancing act between supporting growth, maintaining a “zero-
COVID” policy and addressing financial vulnerabilities. 

Sluggish growth in emerging-market economies and 
the rest of the world
Economic growth in oil-importing EMEs and the rest-of-the-world group is 
subdued and expected to remain so over the projection horizon. Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine and tight financial conditions have created headwinds 
in both regions. Some emerging markets have experienced capital 
outflows—particularly those with weaker macroeconomic fundamentals. 
The appreciation of the US dollar also risks creating additional issues for 
debt sustainability in countries with significant debt denominated in US 
dollars. The moderation in growth that began in 2022 is expected to continue 
through 2023. In 2024, growth is projected to rise as the effects of headwinds 
dissipate.

Falling commodity prices
Prices for Brent oil have declined since the July Report (Chart 4). Falling 
economic growth worldwide, due in part to tighter monetary policy globally 
and softening demand in China, has contributed to the decline in prices. 
These factors are outweighing the effects of the recent decision by the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC 
oil producers (OPEC+) to cut oil production.

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLiCy REPORT  •  OCTOBER 2022

GLOBAL ECONOMy  9 

Looking ahead, the Bank assumes that prices for Brent oil will stay near 
current levels. Prices for West Texas Intermediate and Western Canadian 
Select are assumed to be US$5 and US$20 below Brent prices, respectively 
(Box 2).
Natural gas prices are below those at the time of the July Report, and they 
have become more volatile. Russia’s threat to cut off gas supplies to Europe 
this coming winter led to a price spike in that region. European prices then 
fell after gas storage facilities were filled ahead of schedule. Movements 
in European prices have had spillovers onto prices in Asia and, to a lesser 
extent, North America.

Since the July Report, the Bank’s non-energy commodity price index has 
declined by roughly 5%. The largest drop was in forestry prices, due to 
slowing housing activity in North America. Agricultural prices have eased 
as a number of regions have reported bumper harvests and war-related 
disruptions have had a smaller effect than first projected.

CANADiAN ECONOMy  10 

Canadian economy
Canadian economy

The rise in inflation in Canada through 2022 has been pronounced and has 
broadened over time. Demand for goods and, in particular, services has 
outpaced supply, and measures of core inflation continue to be elevated. 
Household and business expectations for inflation over the next two years 
remain high. The longer high inflation lasts and the more pervasive it 
becomes, the greater the risk that it becomes entrenched.

To lower inflation, the Bank of Canada rapidly raised its policy rate and is 
undertaking quantitative tightening. These actions, combined with interest 
rate increases by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks, have 
led to a rapid tightening in domestic financial conditions over the past year. 
As a result, economic growth in Canada is slowing, allowing supply to catch 
up with demand. Housing activity has fallen sharply from the exceptional 
peak recorded earlier this year. Household spending on goods is slowing, 
and firms’ plans for investment and hiring are softening. The slowdown in 
economic activity abroad, particularly in the United States, has also begun 
to weigh on exports. Over the projection, the weaker Canadian dollar is 
expected to offset some of the impact on exports coming from slowing foreign 
demand.  

Economic growth is forecast to slow from 3¼% in 2022 to just under 1% 
in 2023. It picks up to 2% in 2024 as the impact of higher interest rates on 
Canadian growth fades, potential output growth picks up and foreign demand 
stabilizes (Table 2).
Inflation has declined since June, primarily due to lower gasoline prices. It 
continues to decrease over the projection horizon, reaching around 3% by the 
end of 2023 and returning to the 2% target by the end of 2024. The decrease 
in inflation occurs as higher interest rates in Canada and abroad continue 
to work their way through the economy and the impact of global supply 
disruptions fades.

Persistently high inflation 
At 6.9% in September, inflation in Canada was well above the Bank’s target. 
Inflation is broad-based, with almost two-thirds of the components of the consumer 
price index (CPI) showing price increases of greater than 5% over the past year. For 
example, food price inflation and services price inflation have been high (Box 3). 
However, due to falling gasoline prices, inflation has been declining from its 8.1% 
peak in June (Chart 5). Prices for agricultural products have also tapered off, as 
have the inflationary pressures from global supply bottlenecks. These forces are 
expected to pass through to lower food and goods price inflation in the months 
ahead.

Chart 3-A: Shelter inﬂ ation is elevated
New Housing Price Index and selected CPI components, year-over-year 
percentage change, monthly data

Shelter and food infl ation 
High infl ation is stretching household budgets and 
creating hardship for many families in Canada. This is 
evident in the rise in shelter costs and food prices, which 
form approximately 40% of the CPI basket and typically 
make up a greater share of spending for lower-income 
Canadians.1

Shelter price infl ation was close to 7% earlier this 
year and remains elevated (Chart 3-A). Three main 
components drive shelter prices in the CPI: 

  homeowners’ replacement cost, which represents 

24% of the category

  mortgage interest cost, which makes up 11%

  rent, which represents 24%2 

Homeowners’ replacement cost infl ation, constructed 
from the New Housing Price Index, peaked at 14% 
in the fall of 2021 as house prices boomed during 
the pandemic. It has since eased to about 8% as the 
housing market has slowed in response to higher 
interest rates.  

Infl ation rates for the other two main components of 
shelter have been rising. Mortgage interest cost, which 
mainly refl ects changes in interest rates, turned positive 
in April on a month-over-month basis and is now up 
about 8% year-over-year. Rent price infl ation is also 
elevated at 4% year-over-year because demand for 
rental accommodation has increased. This demand 
has several sources, including a strong resumption of 
immigration and the return of students to out-of-town 
universities.

Food price infl ation picked up over 2022 and is now 
more than 11% on a year-over-year basis (Chart 3-B). 
Elevated food infl ation is widespread: of the 20 major 
components of the CPI’s “food purchased from stores” 
category, over four-fi fths are above 7%. Food products 
that require more processing have seen the biggest 
price increases. For example, while prices of meat and 
fresh vegetables are increasing at roughly 8% and 12%, 
respectively, those of bakery and cereal products (which 
includes pasta) and condiments are up more than 16% 
and 12%, respectively.  

1  Food refers to food purchased from stores and excludes meals in 

restaurants. Shelter excludes utilities other than water.

2  The remaining 41% of shelter in the CPI captures other costs, such 
as insurance, property taxes, water, maintenance and other owned 
accommodation expenses.

Box 3 (continued)

Several factors are behind the high infl ation of food 
prices. Agricultural commodity prices had increased 
dramatically since mid-2020, hitting a peak earlier 
this year (Chart 3-C). Moreover, the past increase 
in commodity input costs is still being passed on to 
consumers. High distribution costs and increases in 
processing costs, such as energy inputs and labour 
costs, are also contributing to food price infl ation. 
The decline in agricultural commodity prices in recent 
months, however, should start to put downward pressure 
on food price infl ation in the coming year.

In Canada, the demand for goods and services is outpacing the economy’s 
ability to supply them. Businesses continue to report widespread labour 
shortages. And strong demand has led to a sharp rise in the prices of 
services. 

This strong and persistent demand is reflected in the Bank’s measures of 
core inflation. CPI-median and CPI-trim are currently at 4.7% and 5.2%, 
respectively. For more on core inflation measures, see the Appendix on 
page 28. 

Inflation is typically reported on a year-over-year basis to smooth out some 
of the fluctuations that occur in higher-frequency measures. However, 
movements over a 12-month period do not provide as timely an assessment 
of inflationary pressures as those measures that focus on the most recent 
data do. Three-month measures of inflation are both more timely and more 
volatile than year-over-year measures. 

Largely due to the drop in gasoline prices, 3-month CPI inflation has fallen 
sharply and is now well below the year-over-year measure. Measures of 
3-month core inflation point to a slowdown to around 4% (Chart 6). This 
reflects fewer near-term price pressures from durable goods and shelter. 
At the same time, however, food price inflation and services price inflation 
(excluding shelter) have been showing strong momentum (Chart 7).

Although 3-month measures of core inflation point to a lower level of 
underlying inflation than the year-over-year measure, their levels remain well 
above target. To see a clear decline in underlying inflation, a more sustained 
further decrease in the 3-month measures would be required. 

Elevated inflation expectations 
Most respondents to consumer and business surveys expect average CPI 
inflation over the next two years to be well above the 2% target (Chart 8). 
The distribution of survey responses remains markedly wider than before 
the pandemic, suggesting that the level of uncertainty about the future path 
of inflation over the next few years is still high. Moreover, more respondents 
expect inflation to be above target than below. At the same time, long-term 
expectations for CPI inflation—particularly those gathered from surveys of 
professional forecasters and measures based on financial markets—remain 
consistent with the 2% target. This indicates that longer-term expectations 
remain well anchored.

Recent dynamics are mixed. Consumers’ short-term CPI inflation 
expectations have continued to edge higher, driven by concerns about supply 
chain disruptions and oil prices. In contrast, the results of the Business 
Outlook Survey (BOS) for the third quarter of 2022 suggest that firms’ short-
term CPI inflation expectations have eased slightly. The share of firms 
expecting very large price increases has moderated (Chart 9).  
When it comes to expectations of their own input cost pressures and pricing, 
firms see inflation slowing. For the first time since mid-2020, firms now expect 
that cost and pricing pressures will be less intense than they were over the 
past 12 months (Chart 10).

Significant excess demand 
The strong labour market and persistent capacity constraints indicate that 
there is still substantial excess demand in the Canadian economy. The labour 
market continues to be tight across a broad range of measures, suggesting 
that it has surpassed maximum sustainable employment (Chart 11). The 
unemployment rate in September was 5.2%, one of the lowest rates in 
40 years. A historically high number of firms responding to the BOS stated 
that they are facing more intense labour shortages than they were a year ago. 
The ratios of vacancies and job postings to unemployed workers also remain 
close to their all-time highs. Over the last six months, wage growth has 
increased and broadened across sectors (Chart 12). 
Employment, however, has been softening in recent months, particularly in 
some sectors that are sensitive to interest rates, such as manufacturing and 
construction. This moderation also reflects an overall decline in the labour 
force participation rate since the beginning of the year, partly due to the 
increased number of retirements. 

Capacity constraints remain significant. Results from recent business surveys 
suggest that supply chain bottlenecks persist (Chart 13). In the BOS, firms 
report some reductions in lead times and increases in the availability of 
materials.

The Bank estimates that the output gap was between 0.25% and 1.25% in 
the third quarter of 2022, similar to the estimate for the second quarter.

Slowing demand growth and rising supply
Growth was robust in the first half of 2022 as the Canadian economy 
reopened. High commodity prices and the easing of public health restrictions 
were boosting economic activity. 

In the spring, rising mortgage rates contributed to a sharp slowing of housing 
resales, and, by the middle of the year, economic activity started showing 
signs of moderation. Growth is estimated to have eased to around 1½% in the 
third quarter. GDP growth is then projected to slow to between 0% and ½% 
through the end of 2022 and the first half of 2023 (Table 3 and Chart 14). 
This suggests that a couple of quarters with growth slightly below zero is just 
as likely as a couple of quarters with small positive growth.

CANADiAN ECONOMy  20 

The slowdown reflects tighter financial conditions that are weighing heavily 
on household demand and business investment. As the boost from pent-up 
demand for in-person services fades, consumption growth softens. Weaker 
foreign demand, particularly in the United States, leads to a decline in export 
growth. The recent depreciation of the Canadian dollar partially offsets this 
impact.

Starting in the second half of 2023, GDP growth picks up as the effect 
of interest rate increases subsides and potential output recovers. Robust 
immigration also supports a pickup in housing demand in 2024. Quarterly 
growth in exports increases following a resumption of economic growth in the 
United States. 

Growth in potential output rises from around ¾% in 2022 to about 2% in 
2023 and 2024. Record immigration, fewer supply chain issues and easing 
of other pandemic-related factors, such as public health measures, support 
potential output growth (Box 4).
With soft demand growth and solid potential output growth, excess demand 
in the Canadian economy turns into excess supply in early 2023. 

Lower household spending growth
Household spending is expected to contract modestly in the fourth quarter 
of 2022 and through the first half of 2023. Higher interest rates weigh on 
household spending, with housing and big-ticket items being the most 
affected (Chart 15). Decreasing house prices, financial wealth and consumer 
confidence also restrain household spending. 

Borrowing costs have risen sharply. The costs for those taking on a new 
mortgage are up markedly. Households renewing an existing mortgage are 
facing a larger increase than has been experienced during any tightening 
cycle over the past 30 years. For example, a homeowner who signed a 
five-year fixed-rate mortgage in October 2017 would now be faced with a 
mortgage rate that is 1½ to 2 percentage points higher at renewal.

CANADiAN ECONOMy  21 

Potential output in Canada 
Growth in potential output is expected to pick up from 
about 0.7% in 2022 to just over 2% in 2023 and 2024. 
It has been revised down by 0.5 percentage points, 
on average, in 2023 and 2024 compared with the July 
Report (Table 4-A).1 The downward revision reduces 
the size of the rebound in potential output growth over 
the projection. 

Trend labour productivity growth over the forecast has 
been revised down. Supply challenges have proved 
to be quite persistent, which suggests that larger 
restructuring and reallocation issues are at play. The 
Bank of Canada’s consultations reveal that businesses 
will continue to adjust—for example, by sourcing from 
new suppliers, rearranging their global value chains or 
holding more inventories. Consequently, supply chains, 
in the medium term, will not return to their pre-pandemic 
form as previously assumed.

In addition, trend labour input growth is lower in 2023 
than assumed in the July Report. Labour market 
mismatch—the gap between the skills, interests and 
experience of job seekers and the types of workers 
employers are looking for—is assumed to have more 
persistent impacts on the ability of fi rms in many 
industries to hire workers. Furthermore, illness-related 
absences appear to be more frequent than before the 
pandemic. These factors are partially offset by upward 
revisions to net immigration fl ows. 

1  The pandemic has had both temporary and lasting effects on the supply side of 

the economy. Recent issues of the Report distinguished between supply and 
potential output to account for the episodic nature of some decreases in supply 
caused by pandemic-related factors, such as public health measures and 
supply chain disruptions. Elevated uncertainty about the likely persistence and 
timing over which these factors could dissipate makes this distinction artifi cially 
precise. The impact of these factors on potential output is now included in 
estimates of trend total factor productivity and trend labour input.

The rebound in potential output growth in 2023 and 
2024 is supported by strong immigration and a recovery 
in trend labour productivity growth. After declining 
sharply at the height of the pandemic, net immigration 
surged by about 270,000 people in the second quarter 
of 2022—by far the highest single-quarter increase in 
Canadian history. In line with the federal government’s 
target to welcome 1.3 million permanent residents over 
2022–24, net immigration accounts for more than two-
thirds of potential output growth.

Trend labour productivity growth recovers to just 
below 1% in 2023 and 2024. This largely refl ects an 
improvement in total factor productivity growth as the 
drag from supply challenges and other pandemic-related 
factors fades.

Growth of potential output in Canada is assumed to 
exceed that in the United States in 2023 and 2024. Over 
that period, potential output grows by about 2.1% on 
average in Canada, 0.4 percentage points higher than in 
the United States (Table 4-B). Over the projection, net 
immigration fl ows of working-age individuals make up on 
average 1.2 percentage points of potential output growth 
in Canada, compared with 0.3 percentage points in the 
United States.2 In contrast, trend labour productivity 

growth is assumed to be lower in Canada than in the 
United States, much as it has been over the past two 
decades.

The rise in mortgage rates contributed to a sharp pullback in resales beginning 
in March. Resales have continued to decline and are now below pre-pandemic 
levels (Chart 16). Renovation activity has also weakened. The contraction in 
residential investment that began in the second quarter of the year is projected 
to continue through the first half of 2023, although to a lesser degree. House 
prices, which rose by just over 50% between February 2020 and February 2022, 
have declined by just under 10%.4 They are projected to continue to decline, 
particularly in those markets that saw larger increases during the pandemic.

CANADiAN ECONOMy  23 

Higher borrowing costs are affecting spending on big-ticket items. Spending 
on automobiles, furniture and appliances is the most sensitive to interest 
rates and is already showing signs of slowing. As higher interest rates work 
their way through the economy, disposable income growth and the demand 
for services will also slow. Past experience suggests that the demand for 
travel, hotels, meals at restaurants and communications services will be 
impacted the most. 

Household spending strengthens beginning in the second half of 2023 and 
extends through 2024. Population growth and rising disposable incomes 
support demand as the impact of the tightening in financial conditions wanes. 
For example, new residential construction is boosted by strong immigration in 
markets that are already particularly tight.

Slowing business investment
Business investment growth is projected to slow markedly from about 6¾% 
in 2022 to around 1½% in 2023 before increasing modestly to 2¼% in 2024 
(Chart 17). 
According to results of the BOS, investment intentions are positive partly 
because capacity constraints remain significant for many businesses. In 2023, 
growth in business investment spending is expected to slow due to higher 
financing costs, softening demand and moderating capacity constraints. 

Rising bank lending rates, widening corporate spreads and falling equity 
markets have contributed to substantial increases in financing costs for 
many businesses. For example, the average borrowing rate for new business 
loans has risen by about 3 percentage points over the past year. The recent 
depreciation of the Canadian dollar, which makes investment in machinery 
and equipment more expensive, also weighs on business investment. 

Growth picks up in 2024 when demand strengthens across the economy. 
Projects such as the development of electric vehicle production facilities also 
contribute to the uptick.

CANADiAN ECONOMy  24 

Investment growth in the oil and gas sector is anticipated to be solid due 
to relatively high energy prices. However, investment will be restrained by 
ongoing uncertainty about long-term demand and the transition to a low-
carbon economy.

Inventory investment is projected to moderate in 2023 following exceptional 
strength. The easing in global supply chain disruptions will gradually help 
efforts to restock, particularly by retailers, following pandemic-related 
shortages. Firms are assumed to hold more inventories to buffer themselves 
against future supply disruptions and build resilience in their production chains.

Moderate export growth 
Exports grow moderately over the projection horizon. Growth of non-
commodity exports through 2023 slows because of weakening foreign 
demand. The recovery in international travel, the continued easing of global 
supply chain disruptions and the recent depreciation of the Canadian dollar 
provide a partial offset. As foreign demand stabilizes through 2024, non-
commodity exports gradually strengthen (Chart 18). 
Non-energy commodity exports grow moderately in 2023, partly reflecting the 
anticipated return of crop yields to normal levels as well as fewer effects from 
global supply chain disruptions.

Over the projection horizon, energy exports are supported by high prices and 
increased transportation capacity. In 2024, growth should pick up due to the 
expected completion of key projects such as the Trans Mountain Expansion 
pipeline. 

A gradual recovery in business investment spending and ongoing restocking 
by firms will support imports of goods.

Declining inflation in 2023, return to target in 2024
CPI inflation is forecast to decline from around 7% in the fourth quarter of 
2022 to within the 1%–3% target range by the end of 2023 and to return to 
the 2% target by the end of 2024 (Chart 19). Inflation falls as the effects of 
past increases in commodity prices dissipate and the inflationary pressures 
from global supply disruptions fade. Other factors (Chart 19, yellow bars) are 
also expected to ease. These potentially include the pass-through of elevated 
energy costs to the prices of other goods and services as well as elevated 
shelter costs. Specifically, high energy costs seem to have passed through to 
inflation much more than is usual. It will take some time for these unusually 
large impacts to fully recede.

The rise in interest rates slows spending, reduces demand and helps return 
inflation back to target. In particular, moderating demand leads to a softening 
of inflation of services prices. This includes lower house prices and declining 
shelter price inflation through mid-2023. Shelter price inflation, however, 
remains positive due to the lasting effect of increased mortgage interest costs 
and strong growth in rent.5 

The recent depreciation of the Canadian dollar provides a modest boost to 
import prices and inflation in 2023.

RiSKS TO THE iNFLATiON OUTLOOK  26 

Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook

The global economy faces a growing set of complex challenges and risks. 
In most countries, inflation remains high and widespread. Many central 
banks have rapidly raised interest rates, and some have begun to shrink 
their balance sheets. Financial conditions have tightened sharply in 2022, 
increasing financial stresses. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and rising 
geopolitical tensions remain major sources of uncertainty. 

Some of the risks identified in previous issues of the Report have been 
partially incorporated into the projection. The base-case scenario includes 
weaker global growth, lower commodity prices and transportation costs, 
tighter global financial conditions and a sharper near-term decline in 
Canadian housing activity.

The Bank sees two main risks to the outlook for inflation. On the upside, inflation 
may remain higher for longer than anticipated in the base case. One way this 
could occur is if inflation expectations do not adjust downward as expected. In 
this case, the wage-price spiral risk scenario described in the July Report could 
be realized. Other factors could also lead to stickier inflation than projected in the 
base case. On the downside, the slowdown in the global economy could be even 
more severe and inflation would fall further than projected.

While the Bank views the risks around its inflation outlook as roughly 
balanced, the upside risk is of greater concern because inflation is 
persistently high.

Main upside risk: High inflation that is more persistent 
Inflation could persist at a rate higher than expected in the base case. This 
risk could arise through either global or domestic channels. 

Some global factors responsible for recent high inflation could last longer 
than assumed in the base case or have a greater impact on consumer prices 
than anticipated. For example, an intensification of the supply disruptions 
related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could trigger spikes in the prices 
of oil, natural gas and agricultural products. More broadly, an increase in 
geopolitical tensions could prolong disruptions to supply chains, risking 
higher prices on internationally traded goods. 

Domestic factors could also keep inflation high for longer than anticipated. 
Short-term inflation expectations have increased considerably since the 
onset of the pandemic. If these expectations prove to be more persistent than 
anticipated in the base case, inflation will remain higher for longer. 

Another risk is that households may tap into their elevated levels of savings 
more than anticipated in the base case. This would lead to increased 
household spending and greater upward pressure on inflation. 

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLiCy REPORT  •  OCTOBER 2022

RiSKS TO THE iNFLATiON OUTLOOK  27 

Main downside risk: Severe global slowdown 
As monetary policy tightens in many countries, long-standing global 
financial vulnerabilities could amplify the impacts on the global economy. 
Many countries have high levels of sovereign, non-financial corporate and 
household debt. Significant external and US-dollar borrowing is an additional 
vulnerability for several EMEs. Some funding markets have become more 
fragile due to lower levels of liquidity. An abrupt repricing of risk could 
trigger funding strains for higher-risk borrowers and a prolonged period of 
deleveraging. The result could lead to a more severe global slowdown and 
lower commodity prices. 

The Canadian economy could be affected through weaker foreign demand, 
lower terms of trade and spillovers into its financial system. The resulting 
tighter financial conditions and higher unemployment could undermine 
homebuyer sentiment and lead to a larger-than-expected drop in house 
prices. This in turn could reduce household wealth, access to credit and 
consumer confidence.

The base case assumes that the spike in goods prices since the beginning 
of the pandemic will persist. These prices could decline, however, if the 
slowdown in global growth proves to be more severe than anticipated. 
A sharper slowdown in growth, notably in the United States, could push down 
goods prices if retailers who find themselves with too much inventory offer 
deep discounts.

Appendix: Measuring 
core inflation 
core inflation 

Inflation can be quite volatile. To help see through the excess volatility in 
inflation data, central banks often use measures of core inflation. Because 
no core measure is clearly superior, the Bank of Canada considers multiple 
approaches, each of which has its strengths and weaknesses. CPI-trim and 
CPI-median have both proved to be reliable indicators of underlying inflation 
throughout the pandemic. In contrast, CPI-common has become unreliable 
in real time because it has been subject to large revisions. Consequently, 
the Bank will focus on CPI-trim and CPI-median as its preferred measures of 
core inflation.

Several measures of core inflation
Since 2016, the Bank has used three measures of core inflation: CPI-trim, 
CPI-median and CPI-common. CPI-trim recalculates inflation after excluding 
the most extreme (high and low) price changes each month. Similarly, CPI-
median represents the midpoint of the distribution of monthly price changes. 
CPI-common isolates common price changes across the CPI basket and 
recalculates inflation by giving more importance to the components that 
moved closely together over history.

The Bank chose these measures, among many alternatives, mainly because 
they:

  have moved most closely with the key macroeconomic factors behind 

  have best captured underlying inflation after seeing through temporary 

inflation 

fluctuations

Mixed signals throughout the pandemic
The pandemic presented an unprecedented and complex shock that 
has challenged conventional economic models and indicators, including 
measures of core inflation. Importantly, these measures sometimes gave 
mixed signals about underlying inflation.

CPI-trim and CPI-median
CPI-trim and CPI-median appear to have provided an accurate gauge of 
underlying inflation during the pandemic (Chart A-1, panel a).6 The reason 
is that, unlike other core measures that rely on the past behaviour of prices, 
these measures are based on the distribution of price changes each month. 
Their relative flexibility made CPI-trim and CPI-median well suited to deal 
with the unfamiliarity of the pandemic and capture important changes in the 
behaviour of inflation. 

Many of the CPI components that were most volatile at the onset of the 
pandemic had not typically been so volatile before. Extreme price movements 
on the high side and low side were also more common. 

As a result, CPI-trim and CPI-median eased modestly below the 2% target 
as the economy weakened at the beginning of the pandemic, but they did 
not fall as much as other measures of core inflation. By early 2021, CPI-trim 
and CPI-median both slightly exceeded 2%, providing an earlier warning 
than other core measures that underlying inflation was rising. By mid-2021, 
high inflation continued to broaden across the CPI basket. This was clearly 
reflected in the subsequent behaviour of CPI-trim and CPI-median. In 2022, 
the two measures continued to rise, reaching well above the 2% target. At the 
same time, total inflation reached highs not seen in decades, and inflationary 
pressures became unambiguously widespread.

CPI-common
CPI-common was relatively slow to show a lasting increase in inflation 
(Chart A-1, panel b).7 One reason for this was how it treated price changes 
of internationally traded goods. Before the pandemic, these prices tended 

6  For more, see T. Macklem, “What’s happening to inflation and why it matters” (speech to the Halifax 

Chamber of Commerce, Halifax, October 6, 2022). See also M. Khan and E. Sullivan, “Core inflation over 
the COVID-19 pandemic,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note (forthcoming).

7  For a review of recent revisions to CPI-common, see E. Sullivan, “Examining recent revisions to CPI-

common,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2022-15 (October 2022).

 
 

BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POLiCy REPORT  •  OCTOBER 2022

APPENDix: MEASURiNG CORE iNFLATiON   30 

not to move much with the rest of the components of the CPI basket. As a 
result, CPI-common did not place much emphasis on the strong inflationary 
pressures coming from internationally traded goods prices in 2021. The 
resulting real-time estimate of CPI-common was notably lower than the 
estimate provided by CPI-trim and CPI-median. With the common price 
movements in the CPI components becoming more widespread than in the 
pre-pandemic period, the estimated weight on traded goods prices in CPI-
common increased. Consequently, estimates of CPI-common during the 
pandemic have been revised up substantially, and these revised estimates 
are similar to those for CPI-trim and CPI-median throughout the pandemic. 

Alternative measures of core inflation
The Bank also monitors alternative measures of core inflation, notably CPIX 
and CPI-XFET.8 These exclusion-based measures remove a fixed group 
of CPI components that have historically tended to be more volatile. For 
example, CPI-XFET excludes food and energy. This approach differs from 
that used in CPI-trim and CPI-median, which exclude different components 
each month. 

At the onset of the pandemic, CPIX and CPI-XFET fell sharply toward the 
lower end of the Bank’s inflation-control range, suggesting less underlying 
inflation than CPI-trim and CPI-median did. This happened because the 
exclusion-based measures did not reflect the changes in the most volatile 
components that occurred at the beginning of the pandemic. CPIX and CPI-
XFET then remained below the 2% target for about one year before moving 
largely together with CPI-trim and CPI-median (Chart A-2).

Core inflation increasingly important
Measures of core inflation can help detect important and lasting changes 
in inflation. CPI-common is no longer informative in real time because it 
has been subject to large historical revisions. In contrast, CPI-trim and CPI-
median better capture changes in price behaviour. These measures appear 
to have performed well during the pandemic and are subject to much smaller 
revisions. Going forward, the Bank’s focus will be on these two measures.
