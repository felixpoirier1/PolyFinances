Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity in Canada during April 2022,2022-10-27,
"Bank of Canada increases policy interest rate by 50 basis points, continues quantitative tightening",2022-06-01,"The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 1½%, with the Bank Rate at 1¾% and the deposit rate at 1½%. The Bank is also continuing its policy of quantitative tightening (QT).
Inflation globally and in Canada continues to rise, largely driven by higher prices for energy and food. In Canada, CPI inflation reached 6.8% for the month of April – well above the Bank’s forecast – and will likely move even higher in the near term before beginning to ease. As pervasive input price pressures feed through into consumer prices, inflation continues to broaden, with core measures of inflation ranging between 3.2% and 5.1%. Almost 70% of CPI categories now show inflation above 3%. The risk of elevated inflation becoming entrenched has risen. The Bank will use its monetary policy tools to return inflation to target and keep inflation expectations well anchored.
The increase in global inflation is occurring as the global economy slows. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, China’s COVID-related lockdowns, and ongoing supply disruptions are all weighing on activity and boosting inflation. The war has increased uncertainty and is putting further upward pressure on prices for energy and agricultural commodities. This is dampening the outlook, particularly in Europe. In the United States, private domestic demand remains robust, despite the economy contracting in the first quarter of 2022. US labour market strength continues, with wage pressures intensifying. Global financial conditions have tightened and markets have been volatile.
Canadian economic activity is strong and the economy is clearly operating in excess demand. National accounts data for the first quarter of 2022 showed GDP growth of 3.1 percent, in line with the Bank’s April Monetary Policy Report (MPR) projection. Job vacancies are elevated, companies are reporting widespread labour shortages, and wage growth has been picking up and broadening across sectors. Housing market activity is moderating from exceptionally high levels. With consumer spending in Canada remaining robust and exports anticipated to strengthen, growth in the second quarter is expected to be solid.
With the economy in excess demand, and inflation persisting well above target and expected to move higher in the near term, the Governing Council continues to judge that interest rates will need to rise further. The policy interest rate remains the Bank’s primary monetary policy instrument, with quantitative tightening acting as a complementary tool. The pace of further increases in the policy rate will be guided by the Bank’s ongoing assessment of the economy and inflation, and the Governing Council is prepared to act more forcefully if needed to meet its commitment to achieve the 2% inflation target.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is July 13, 2022. The Bank will publish its next full outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the MPR at the same time."
Bank of Canada welcomes IMF report following transparency review,2022-09-28,
"Bank of Canada increases policy interest rate by 75 basis points,  continues quantitative tightening",2022-09-07,"The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 3¼%, with the Bank Rate at 3½% and the deposit rate at 3¼%. The Bank is also continuing its policy of quantitative tightening.
The global and Canadian economies are evolving broadly in line with the Bank’s July projection. The effects of COVID-19 outbreaks, ongoing supply disruptions, and the war in Ukraine continue to dampen growth and boost prices.
Global inflation remains high and measures of core inflation are moving up in most countries. In response, central banks around the world continue to tighten monetary policy. Economic activity in the United States has moderated, although the US labour market remains tight. China is facing ongoing challenges from COVID shutdowns. Commodity prices have been volatile: oil, wheat and lumber prices have moderated while natural gas prices have risen.
In Canada, CPI inflation eased in July to 7.6% from 8.1% because of a drop in gasoline prices.  However, inflation excluding gasoline increased and data indicate a further broadening of price pressures, particularly in services. The Bank’s core measures of inflation continued to move up, ranging from 5% to 5.5% in July. Surveys suggest that short-term inflation expectations remain high. The longer this continues, the greater the risk that elevated inflation becomes entrenched.
The Canadian economy continues to operate in excess demand and labour markets remain tight. Canada’s GDP grew by 3.3% in the second quarter. While this was somewhat weaker than the Bank had projected, indicators of domestic demand were very strong – consumption grew by about 9½% and business investment was up by close to 12%. With higher mortgage rates, the housing market is pulling back as anticipated, following unsustainable growth during the pandemic. The Bank continues to expect the economy to moderate in the second half of this year, as global demand weakens and tighter monetary policy here in Canada begins to bring demand more in line with supply.
Given the outlook for inflation, the Governing Council still judges that the policy interest rate will need to rise further. Quantitative tightening is complementing increases in the policy rate. As the effects of tighter monetary policy work through the economy, we will be assessing how much higher interest rates need to go to return inflation to target. The Governing Council remains resolute in its commitment to price stability and will continue to take action as required to achieve the 2% inflation target.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is October 26, 2022. The Bank will publish its next full outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the MPR at the same time."

Bank of Canada publishes 2023 schedule for interest rate announcements,2022-07-26,
"Bank of Canada increases policy interest rate by 100 basis points, continues quantitative tightening",2022-07-13,"The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 2½%, with the Bank Rate at 2¾% and the deposit rate at 2½%. The Bank is also continuing its policy of quantitative tightening (QT).
Inflation in Canada is higher and more persistent than the Bank expected in its April Monetary Policy Report (MPR), and will likely remain around 8% in the next few months. While global factors such as the war in Ukraine and ongoing supply disruptions have been the biggest drivers, domestic price pressures from excess demand are becoming more prominent. More than half of the components that make up the CPI are now rising by more than 5%. With this broadening of price pressures, the Bank’s core measures of inflation have moved up to between 3.9% and 5.4%. Also, surveys indicate more consumers and businesses are expecting inflation to be higher for longer, raising the risk that elevated inflation becomes entrenched in price- and wage-setting. If that occurs, the economic cost of restoring price stability will be higher.
Global inflation is higher, reflecting the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, ongoing supply constraints, and strong demand. Many central banks are tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, and the resulting tighter financial conditions are moderating economic growth. In the United States, high inflation and rising interest rates are contributing to a slowdown in domestic demand. China’s economy is being held back by waves of restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 outbreaks. Oil prices remain high and volatile. The Bank now expects global economic growth to slow to about 3½% this year and 2% in 2023 before strengthening to 3% in 2024.
Further excess demand has built up in the Canadian economy. Labour markets are tight with a record low unemployment rate, widespread labour shortages, and increasing wage pressures. With strong demand, businesses are passing on higher input and labour costs by raising prices. Consumption is robust, led by a rebound in spending on hard-to-distance services. Business investment is solid and exports are being boosted by elevated commodity prices. The Bank estimates that GDP grew by about 4% in the second quarter. Growth is expected to slow to about 2% in the third quarter as consumption growth moderates and housing market activity pulls back following unsustainable strength during the pandemic.
The Bank expects Canada’s economy to grow by 3½% in 2022, 1¾% in 2023, and 2½% in 2024. Economic activity will slow as global growth moderates and tighter monetary policy works its way through the economy. This, combined with the resolution of supply disruptions, will bring demand and supply back into balance and alleviate inflationary pressures. Global energy prices are also projected to decline. The July outlook has inflation starting to come back down later this year, easing to about 3% by the end of next year and returning to the 2% target by the end of 2024.
With the economy clearly in excess demand, inflation high and broadening, and more businesses and consumers expecting high inflation to persist for longer, the Governing Council decided to front-load the path to higher interest rates by raising the policy rate by 100 basis points today. The Governing Council continues to judge that interest rates will need to rise further, and the pace of increases will be guided by the Bank’s ongoing assessment of the economy and inflation. Quantitative tightening continues and is complementing increases in the policy interest rate. The Governing Council is resolute in its commitment to price stability and will continue to take action as required to achieve the 2% inflation target.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is September 7, 2022. The Bank will publish its next full outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the MPR on October 26, 2022."
Deputy Governor Timothy Lane to Retire from the Bank of Canada,2022-06-22,
The Bank of Canada Releases Its Annual Report for 2021,2022-04-26,
"Bank of Canada increases policy interest rate by 50 basis points, begins quantitative tightening",2022-04-13,"The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 1%, with the Bank Rate at 1¼% and the deposit rate at 1%. The Bank is also ending reinvestment and will begin quantitative tightening (QT), effective April 25. Maturing Government of Canada bonds on the Bank’s balance sheet will no longer be replaced and, as a result, the size of the balance sheet will decline over time.
Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine is causing unimaginable human suffering and new economic uncertainty. Price spikes in oil, natural gas and other commodities are adding to inflation around the world. Supply disruptions resulting from the war are also exacerbating ongoing supply constraints and weighing on activity. These factors are the primary drivers of a substantial upward revision to the Bank’s outlook for inflation in Canada.
The war in Ukraine is disrupting the global recovery, just as most economies are emerging from the impact of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. European countries are more directly impacted by confidence effects and supply dislocations caused by the war. China’s economy is facing new COVID outbreaks and an ongoing correction in its property market. In the United States, domestic demand remains very strong and the US Federal Reserve has clearly indicated its resolve to use its monetary policy tools to control inflation. As policy stimulus is withdrawn, US growth is expected to moderate to a pace more in line with potential growth. Global financial conditions have tightened and volatility has increased. The Bank now forecasts global growth of about 3½% this year, 2½% in 2023 and 3¼% in 2024.
In Canada, growth is strong and the economy is moving into excess demand. Labour markets are tight, and wage growth is back to its pre-pandemic pace and rising. Businesses increasingly report they are having difficulty meeting demand, and are able to pass on higher input costs by increasing prices. While the COVID-19 virus continues to mutate and circulate, high rates of vaccination have reduced its health and economic impacts. Growth looks to have been stronger in the first quarter than projected in January and is likely to pick up in the second quarter. Consumer spending is strengthening with the lifting of pandemic containment measures. Exports and business investment will continue to recover, supported by strong foreign demand and high commodity prices. Housing market activity, which has been exceptionally high, is expected to moderate.
The Bank forecasts that Canada’s economy will grow by 4¼% this year before slowing to 3¼% in 2023 and 2¼% in 2024. Robust business investment, labour productivity growth and higher immigration will add to the economy’s productive capacity, while higher interest rates should moderate growth in domestic demand.
CPI inflation in Canada is 5.7%, above the Bank’s forecast in its January Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Inflation is being driven by rising energy and food prices and supply disruptions, in combination with strong global and domestic demand. Core measures of inflation have all moved higher as price pressures broaden. CPI inflation is now expected to average almost 6% in the first half of 2022 and remain well above the control range throughout this year. It is then expected to ease to about 2½% in the second half of 2023 and return to the 2% target in 2024. There is an increasing risk that expectations of elevated inflation could become entrenched. The Bank will use its monetary policy tools to return inflation to target and keep inflation expectations well-anchored.
With the economy moving into excess demand and inflation persisting well above target, the Governing Council judges that interest rates will need to rise further. The policy interest rate is the Bank’s primary monetary policy instrument, and quantitative tightening will complement increases in the policy rate. The timing and pace of further increases in the policy rate will be guided by the Bank’s ongoing assessment of the economy and its commitment to achieving the 2% inflation target.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is June 1, 2022. The Bank will publish its next full outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the MPR on July 13, 2022.
A market notice providing operational details for QT will be published this morning on the Bank’s web site."

Bank of Canada increases policy interest rate,2022-03-02,"The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to ½ %, with the Bank Rate at ¾ % and the deposit rate at ½ %. The Bank is continuing its reinvestment phase, keeping its overall holdings of Government of Canada bonds on its balance sheet roughly constant until such time as it becomes appropriate to allow the size of its balance sheet to decline.
The unprovoked invasion of Ukraine by Russia is a major new source of uncertainty. Prices for oil and other commodities have risen sharply. This will add to inflation around the world, and negative impacts on confidence and new supply disruptions could weigh on global growth. Financial market volatility has increased. The situation remains fluid and we are following events closely.
Global economic data has come in broadly in line with projections in the Bank’s January Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Economies are emerging from the impact of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 more quickly than expected, although the virus continues to circulate and the possibility of new variants remains a concern. Demand is robust, particularly in the United States. Global supply bottlenecks remain challenging, although there are indications that some constraints have eased.
Economic growth in Canada was very strong in the fourth quarter of last year at 6.7%. This is stronger than the Bank’s projection and confirms its view that economic slack has been absorbed. Both exports and imports have picked up, consistent with solid global demand. In January, the recovery in Canada’s labour market suffered a setback due to the Omicron variant, with temporary layoffs in service sectors and elevated employee absenteeism. However, the rebound from Omicron now appears to be well in train: household spending is proving resilient and should strengthen further with the lifting of public health restrictions. Housing market activity is more elevated, adding further pressure to house prices. Overall, first-quarter growth is now looking more solid than previously projected.
CPI inflation is currently at 5.1%, as expected in January, and remains well above the Bank’s target range. Price increases have become more pervasive, and measures of core inflation have all risen. Poor harvests and higher transportation costs have pushed up food prices. The invasion of Ukraine is putting further upward pressure on prices for both energy and food-related commodities. All told, inflation is now expected to be higher in the near term than projected in January. Persistently elevated inflation is increasing the risk that longer-run inflation expectations could drift upwards. The Bank will use its monetary policy tools to return inflation to the 2% target and keep inflation expectations well-anchored.
The policy rate is the Bank’s primary monetary policy instrument. As the economy continues to expand and inflation pressures remain elevated, the Governing Council expects interest rates will need to rise further. The Governing Council will also be considering when to end the reinvestment phase and allow its holdings of Government of Canada bonds to begin to shrink. The resulting quantitative tightening (QT) would complement increases in the policy interest rate. The timing and pace of further increases in the policy rate, and the start of QT, will be guided by the Bank’s ongoing assessment of the economy and its commitment to achieving the 2% inflation target.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is April 13, 2022. The Bank will publish its next full outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the MPR at the same time."

Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri to Retire from the Bank of Canada,2022-02-18,
"Bank of Canada maintains policy rate, removes exceptional forward guidance",2022-01-26,"The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ %, with the Bank Rate at ½ % and the deposit rate at ¼ %. With overall economic slack now absorbed, the Bank has removed its exceptional forward guidance on its policy interest rate. The Bank is continuing its reinvestment phase, keeping its overall holdings of Government of Canada bonds roughly constant.
The global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is strong but uneven. The US economy is growing robustly while growth in some other regions appears more moderate, especially in China due to current weakness in its property sector. Strong global demand for goods combined with supply bottlenecks that hinder production and transportation are pushing up inflation in most regions. As well, oil prices have rebounded to well above pre-pandemic levels following a decline at the onset of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. Financial conditions remain broadly accommodative but have tightened with growing expectations that monetary policy will normalize sooner than was anticipated, and with rising geopolitical tensions. Overall, the Bank projects global GDP growth to moderate from 6¾ % in 2021 to about 3½ % in 2022 and 2023.
In Canada, GDP growth in the second half of 2021 now looks to have been even stronger than expected. The economy entered 2022 with considerable momentum, and a broad set of measures are now indicating that economic slack is absorbed. With strong employment growth, the labour market has tightened significantly. Job vacancies are elevated, hiring intentions are strong, and wage gains are picking up. Elevated housing market activity continues to put upward pressure on house prices.
The Omicron variant is weighing on activity in the first quarter. While its economic impact will depend on how quickly this wave passes, it is expected to be less severe than previous waves. Economic growth is then expected to bounce back and remain robust over the projection horizon, led by consumer spending on services, and supported by strength in exports and business investment. After GDP growth of 4½ % in 2021, the Bank expects Canada’s economy to grow by 4% in 2022 and about 3½ % in 2023.
CPI inflation remains well above the target range and core measures of inflation have edged up since October. Persistent supply constraints are feeding through to a broader range of goods prices and, combined with higher food and energy prices, are expected to keep CPI inflation close to 5% in the first half of 2022. As supply shortages diminish, inflation is expected to decline reasonably quickly to about 3% by the end of this year and then gradually ease towards the target over the projection period. Near-term inflation expectations have moved up, but longer-run expectations remain anchored on the 2% target. The Bank will use its monetary policy tools to ensure that higher near-term inflation expectations do not become embedded in ongoing inflation.
While COVID-19 continues to affect economic activity unevenly across sectors, the Governing Council judges that overall slack in the economy is absorbed, thus satisfying the condition outlined in the Bank’s forward guidance on its policy interest rate. The Governing Council therefore decided to end its extraordinary commitment to hold its policy rate at the effective lower bound. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects interest rates will need to increase, with the timing and pace of those increases guided by the Bank’s commitment to achieving the 2% inflation target.
The Bank will keep its holdings of Government of Canada bonds on its balance sheet roughly constant at least until it begins to raise the policy interest rate. At that time, the Governing Council will consider exiting the reinvestment phase and reducing the size of its balance sheet by allowing roll-off of maturing Government of Canada bonds.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is March 2, 2022. The Bank will publish its next full outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the Monetary Policy Report on April 13, 2022."

Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Monetary Policy Framework,2021-12-13,
Bank of Canada maintains policy rate and forward guidance,2021-12-08,"The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank’s extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate is being maintained. The Bank is continuing its reinvestment phase, keeping its overall holdings of Government of Canada bonds roughly constant.
The global economy continues to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic growth in the United States has accelerated, led by consumption, while growth in some other regions is moderating after a strong third quarter. Inflation has increased further in many countries, reflecting strong demand for goods amid ongoing supply disruptions. The new Omicron COVID-19 variant has prompted a tightening of travel restrictions in many countries and a decline in oil prices, and has injected renewed uncertainty. Accommodative financial conditions are still supporting economic activity.
Canada’s economy grew by about 5½ percent in the third quarter, as expected. Together with a downward revision to the second quarter, this brings the level of GDP to about 1½ percent below its level in the last quarter of 2019, before the pandemic began. Third-quarter growth was led by a rebound in consumption, particularly services, as restrictions were further eased and higher vaccination rates improved confidence. Persistent supply bottlenecks continued to inhibit growth in other components of GDP, including non-commodity exports and business investment.
Recent economic indicators suggest the economy had considerable momentum into the fourth quarter. This includes broad-based job gains in recent months that have brought the employment rate essentially back to its pre-pandemic level.  Job vacancies remain elevated and wage growth has also picked up. Housing activity had been moderating, but appears to be regaining strength, notably in resales. The devastating floods in British Columbia and uncertainties arising from the Omicron variant could weigh on growth by compounding supply chain disruptions and reducing demand for some services. 
CPI inflation is elevated and the impact of global supply constraints is feeding through to a broader range of goods prices. The effects of these constraints on prices will likely take some time to work their way through, given existing supply backlogs. Gasoline prices, which had been a major factor pushing up CPI inflation, have recently declined. Meanwhile, core measures of inflation are little changed since September. The Bank continues to expect CPI inflation to remain elevated in the first half of 2022 and ease back towards 2 percent in the second half of the year. The Bank is closely watching inflation expectations and labour costs to ensure that the forces pushing up prices do not become embedded in ongoing inflation.
The Governing Council judges that in view of ongoing excess capacity, the economy continues to require considerable monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank’s October projection, this happens sometime in the middle quarters of 2022. We will provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation target.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is January 26, 2022. The Bank will publish its full outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the Monetary Policy Report at the same time."

"Bank of Canada maintains policy rate and forward guidance,  ends quantitative easing",2021-10-27,"The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank’s extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate is being maintained. The Bank is ending quantitative easing (QE) and moving into the reinvestment phase, during which it will purchase Government of Canada bonds solely to replace maturing bonds.
The global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing. Vaccines are proving highly effective against the virus, although their availability and distribution globally remain uneven and COVID variants pose risks to health and economic activity. In the face of strong global demand for goods, pandemic-related disruptions to production and transportation are constraining growth.  Inflation rates have increased in many countries, boosted by these supply bottlenecks and by higher energy prices. While bond yields have risen in recent weeks, financial conditions remain accommodative and continue to support economic activity.
The Bank projects global GDP will grow by 6½ percent in 2021 – a strong pace but less than projected in the July Monetary Policy Report (MPR) – and by 4¼ percent in 2022 and about 3½ percent in 2023.
In Canada, robust economic growth has resumed, following a pause in the second quarter. Strong employment gains in recent months were concentrated in hard-to-distance sectors and among workers most affected by lockdowns. This has significantly reduced the very uneven impact of the pandemic on workers. As the economy reopens, it is taking time for workers to find the right jobs and for employers to hire people with the right skills. This is contributing to labour shortages in certain sectors, even as slack remains in the overall labour market.
The Bank now forecasts Canada’s economy will grow by 5 percent this year before moderating to 4¼ percent in 2022 and 3¾ percent in 2023. Demand is expected to be supported by strong consumption and business investment, and a rebound in exports as the US economy continues to recover. Housing activity has moderated, but is expected to remain elevated. On the supply side, shortages of manufacturing inputs, transportation bottlenecks, and difficulties in matching jobs to workers are limiting the economy’s productive capacity. Although the impact and persistence of these supply factors are hard to quantify, the output gap is likely to be narrower than the Bank had forecast in July.
The recent increase in CPI inflation was anticipated in July, but the main forces pushing up prices – higher energy prices and pandemic-related supply bottlenecks – now appear to be stronger and more persistent than expected. Core measures of inflation have also risen, but by less than the CPI. The Bank now expects CPI inflation to be elevated into next year, and ease back to around the 2 percent target by late 2022. The Bank is closely watching inflation expectations and labour costs to ensure that the temporary forces pushing up prices do not become embedded in ongoing inflation.  
The Governing Council judges that in view of ongoing excess capacity, the economy continues to require considerable monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank’s projection, this happens sometime in the middle quarters of 2022. In light of the progress made in the economic recovery, the Governing Council has decided to end quantitative easing and keep its overall holdings of Government of Canada bonds roughly constant.
We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation target.

"Bank of Canada maintains policy rate, continues forward guidance  and current pace of quantitative easing",2021-09-08,"The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate. This is reinforced and supplemented by the Bank’s quantitative easing (QE) program, which is being maintained at a target pace of $2 billion per week.
The global economic recovery continued through the second quarter, led by strong US growth, and had solid momentum heading into the third quarter. However, supply chain disruptions are restraining activity in some sectors and rising cases of COVID-19 in many regions pose a risk to the strength of the global recovery. Financial conditions remain highly accommodative.
In Canada, GDP contracted by about 1 percent in the second quarter, weaker than anticipated in the Bank’s July Monetary Policy Report (MPR). This largely reflects a contraction in exports, due in part to supply chain disruptions, especially in the auto sector. Housing market activity pulled back from recent high levels, largely as expected. Consumption, business investment and government spending all contributed positively to growth, with domestic demand growing at more than 3 percent. Employment rebounded through June and July, with hard-to-distance sectors hiring as public health restrictions eased. This is reducing unevenness in the labour market, although considerable slack remains and some groups – particularly low-wage workers – are still disproportionately affected. The Bank continues to expect the economy to strengthen in the second half of 2021, although the fourth wave of COVID-19 infections and ongoing supply bottlenecks could weigh on the recovery.
CPI inflation remains above 3 percent as expected, boosted by base-year effects, gasoline prices, and pandemic-related supply bottlenecks. These factors pushing up inflation are expected to be transitory, but their persistence and magnitude are uncertain and will be monitored closely. Wage increases have been moderate to date, and medium-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored. Core measures of inflation have risen, but by less than the CPI.
The Governing Council judges that the Canadian economy still has considerable excess capacity, and that the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank’s July projection, this happens in the second half of 2022. The Bank's QE program continues to reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve. Decisions regarding future adjustments to the pace of net bond purchases will be guided by Governing Council's ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of the recovery. We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is October 27, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."

Bank of Canada appoints Ron Morrow as Executive Director – Retail Payments Supervision,2021-07-28,"The Bank of Canada today announced the appointment of Ron Morrow as Executive Director – Retail Payments Supervision, effective August 9, 2021.
This executive-level position has been created, with endorsement from the Bank’s Board of Directors, to support the Bank’s new mandate to supervise retail payment service providers (PSPs), as per the Retail Payment Activities Act. Under this Act, which was approved by Parliament on June 29, 2021, the Bank will be responsible for supervising PSPs to protect end users and help ensure the safety and reliability of PSP services. As per the Act, the Bank will maintain a public registry of all regulated payment service providers and a regular reporting framework. Bank of Canada supervision will also ensure that PSPs mitigate their operational risk and safeguard end-user funds.
Reporting directly to the Governor, Mr. Morrow will lead the design and implementation of the Retail Payments Supervision (RPS) Framework, including ongoing consultations on the Bank’s supervisory role as regulations are developed.

The Executive Director role will also act as an independent reviewer of enforcement actions initiated by RPS staff and advise the Governor of the Bank of Canada on the evolution of risks related to PSPs and the retail payments landscape.
“This new mandate for the Bank is an important responsibility,” said Governor Macklem. “The payments eco-system in Canada and globally is evolving rapidly, with innovative new options and many new participants. Ron’s expertise, experience and leadership will ensure that we undertake this new role on behalf of Canadians with the same rigour, dedication and professionalism that the Bank applies to all its mandated responsibilities.”

"Bank of Canada maintains policy rate and forward guidance, adjusts quantitative easing program",2021-07-14,"The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate. This is reinforced and supplemented by the Bank’s quantitative easing (QE) program, which is being adjusted to a target pace of $2 billion per week. This adjustment reflects continued progress towards recovery and the Bank’s increased confidence in the strength of the Canadian economic outlook.
The global economy is recovering strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic, with continued progress on vaccinations, particularly in advanced economies. However, the recovery is still highly uneven and remains dependent on the course of the virus. The recent spread of new COVID-19 variants is a growing concern, especially for regions where vaccination rates remain low. 
Global GDP growth is expected to reach 7 percent this year and then moderate to about 4 ½ percent in 2022 and just over 3 percent in 2023. This is a slightly stronger forecast than the one in the Bank’s April Monetary Policy Report (MPR) and primarily reflects a stronger US outlook. Global financial conditions remain highly accommodative. Rising demand is supporting higher oil prices, while non-energy commodity prices remain elevated. The Canada-US exchange rate is little changed since April.
In Canada, the third wave of the virus slowed growth in the second quarter. However, falling COVID-19 cases, progress on vaccinations and easing containment restrictions all point to a strong pickup in the second half of this year. The Bank now expects GDP growth of around 6 percent in 2021 – a little slower than was expected in April – but has revised up its 2022 forecast to 4 ½ percent and projects 3 ¼ percent growth in 2023.
Consumption is expected to lead the recovery as households return to more normal spending patterns, while housing market activity is projected to ease back from historical highs. Stronger international demand should underpin a solid recovery in exports. As domestic and foreign demand increases and confidence improves, business investment will gain strength. Employment has once again begun to rebound, and we expect the hardest-hit segments of the labour market to post strong gains as the economy re-opens. However, the pace of the recovery will vary among industries and workers, and it could take some time to hire workers with the right skills to fill jobs. The aftermath of lockdowns and ongoing structural changes in the economy both mean that estimates of potential output and when the output gap will close are particularly uncertain.
CPI inflation was 3.6 percent in May, boosted by temporary factors that include base-year effects and stronger gasoline prices, as well as pandemic-related bottlenecks as economies re-open. Core measures of inflation have also risen but by less than the CPI. In some high-contact services, demand is rebounding faster than supply, pushing up prices from low levels. Transitory supply constraints in shipping and value chain disruptions for semiconductors are also translating into higher prices for cars and some other goods. With higher gasoline prices and on-going supply bottlenecks, inflation is likely to remain above 3 percent through the second half of this year and ease back toward 2 percent in 2022, as short-run imbalances diminish and the considerable overall slack in the economy pulls inflation lower. The factors pushing up inflation are transitory, but their persistence and magnitude are uncertain and will be monitored closely.
The Governing Council judges that the Canadian economy still has considerable excess capacity, and that the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank’s July projection, this happens sometime in the second half of 2022. The Bank's QE program continues to reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve. Decisions regarding further adjustments to the pace of net bond purchases will be guided by Governing Council's ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of the recovery. We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is September 8, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on October 27, 2021."
Carolyn Rogers appointed as Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada,2021-07-12,"The Board of Directors of the Bank of Canada today announced that Carolyn Rogers has been appointed Senior Deputy Governor for a seven-year term, effective December 15, 2021. The selection was made by the independent members of the Bank’s Board and was approved by the federal Cabinet. Ms. Rogers succeeds Carolyn A. Wilkins, who resigned from the Bank on December 9, 2020.
As Senior Deputy Governor, Ms. Rogers will oversee the Bank’s strategic planning and operations, and provide leadership to the Bank’s role in promoting a stable and efficient financial system. As a member of the Bank’s Governing Council, she will share responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy. She will also be a member of the Bank’s Board of Directors.
""Carolyn Rogers’ wide-ranging experience and unique set of skills superbly complement those of Governor Tiff Macklem and rest of the Bank’s Governing Council,” said Claire Kennedy, Lead Director and Chair of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors. “Her deep knowledge of the Canadian financial system, federal and provincial financial institutions, and payments systems will be invaluable to the Bank in its financial stability responsibilities, and its continued work on payments modernization, central bank digital currency, climate risks and the digitalization of the economy and financial system.”
Governor Tiff Macklem warmly welcomed Ms. Rogers to the new role: “I am delighted that Carolyn Rogers will be joining our team. Her domestic and international experience will bring a diverse perspective to the Bank. She is also a strong senior leader and strategic thinker – invaluable skills as the Bank charts an ambitious path to best serve Canadians.”
A native of Winnipeg, Ms. Rogers currently serves as Secretary General of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. From 2016 to 2019, Ms.  Rogers served as Assistant Superintendent, Regulation Sector at the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), where she was responsible for OSFI’s policy-related functions, including capital, accounting, and legislation. Prior to joining OSFI, Ms. Rogers served as Superintendent and Chief Executive Officer of the integrated financial sector regulator of British Columbia, the Financial Institutions Commission (FICOM) from 2010 to 2016. She chaired the Independent Advisory Group (IAG) on Real Estate Regulation in British Columbia. She also chaired the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators and the Canadian Credit Union Prudential Supervisors’ Association.

Ms. Rogers is a Chartered Professional Accountant, holds a Bachelor of Arts from Brandon University, a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Queen’s University, and has completed the Institute of Corporate Directors program."
"Bank of Canada will hold current level of policy rate until inflation objective is sustainably achieved, continues quantitative easing",2021-03-10,"The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance, reinforced and supplemented by its quantitative easing (QE) program, which continues at its current pace of at least $4 billion per week.
The global economy is recovering from the economic effects of COVID-19, albeit with ongoing unevenness across regions and sectors. The US economic recovery appears to be gaining momentum as virus infections decline and fiscal support boosts incomes and consumption. New fiscal stimulus will increase US consumption and output growth further. Global yield curves have steepened, largely reflecting the improved US growth outlook, but global financial conditions remain highly accommodative. Oil and other commodity prices have risen. The Canadian dollar has been relatively stable against the US dollar, but has appreciated against most other currencies.
In Canada, the economy is proving to be more resilient than anticipated to the second wave of the virus and the associated containment measures.  Although activity in hard-to-distance sectors continues to be held back, recent data point to continued recovery in the rest of the economy. GDP grew 9.6% in the final quarter of 2020, led by strong inventory accumulation. GDP growth in the first quarter of 2021 is now expected to be positive, rather than the contraction forecast in January. Consumers and businesses are adapting to containment measures, and housing market activity has been much stronger than expected. Improving foreign demand and higher commodity prices have also brightened the prospects for exports and business investment.
Despite the stronger near-term outlook, there is still considerable economic slack and a great deal of uncertainty about the evolution of the virus and the path of economic growth. The labour market is a long way from recovery, with employment still well below pre-COVID levels. Low-wage workers, young people and women have borne the brunt of the job losses. The spread of more transmissible variants of the virus poses the largest downside risk to activity, as localized outbreaks and restrictions could restrain growth and add choppiness to the recovery.
CPI inflation is near the bottom of the 1-3 percent target band but is likely to move temporarily to around the top of the band in the next few months. The expected rise in CPI inflation reflects base-year effects from deep price declines in some goods and services at the outset of the crisis a year ago, combined with higher gasoline prices pushed up by the recent run-up in oil prices. CPI inflation is then expected to moderate as base-year effects dissipate and excess capacity continues to exert downward pressure. Measures of core inflation currently range from 1.3 to 2 percent. 
While economic prospects have improved, the Governing Council judges that the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank’s January projection, this does not happen until into 2023. To reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve, the Bank will continue its QE program until the recovery is well underway.  As the Governing Council continues to gain confidence in the strength of the recovery, the pace of net purchases of Government of Canada bonds will be adjusted as required. We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is April 21, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."
"Bank of Canada becomes inaugural member of new, international Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion",2021-04-27,"Joint statement from the Bank of Canada, Te Pūtea Matua (Reserve Bank of New Zealand) and the Reserve Bank of Australia.
Along with Indigenous partners, the Bank of Canada, Te Pūtea Matua (Reserve Bank of New Zealand) and the Reserve Bank of Australia have formed a voluntary network to foster ongoing dialogue and raise awareness of Indigenous economic and financial issues.
The Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion, established January 1, 2021, aims to share knowledge and best practices, promote engagement with Indigenous Peoples, and foster greater understanding and education about Indigenous economic issues and histories.
The network will focus on:
In addition, the network will plan a recurring Central Bank Symposium on Indigenous Economics. The first symposium will be hosted by the Bank of Canada in late 2021.
In formative discussions, Indigenous partners drew on their oral histories and contemporary economic experience to guide discussion and confirmation of the network’s aims. This discussion sought the views of Indigenous partners including Te Rau Kupenga, representative of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Te Ao Māori external advisory panel; and Manny Jules, Chief Commissioner, First Nations Tax Commission and Founder of the Tulo Centre of Indigenous Economics.
The Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion will serve as a community of practice and will not aim to set or take policy positions. The founding members encourage other central banking entities around the world to join. The chair of the Network will rotate annually, with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand serving as chair in 2021.
Bank of Canada: ""The Bank of Canada wants to better understand the Indigenous economy and the obstacles and opportunities that Canada's Indigenous Peoples face,"" Governor Tiff Macklem said. “Our membership in this network provides us with an invaluable opportunity to learn from each other, to forge stronger bonds with Indigenous communities and contribute to making our workplaces and policies more inclusive.”
Tulo Centre of Indigenous Economics: “As Indigenous peoples, we have institutional and economic successes to share, as well as policy and legislative challenges we continue to face. But today, I see the potential for a better tomorrow. Your commitment to work with each other and with us on these issues gives me hope.”

Bank of Canada statement on Monetary Policy Report embargo breach,2021-04-21,"The Bank of Canada expects all media organizations to respect the embargo conditions for its key publications. Today, the Bank provided the Monetary Policy Report (MPR) under embargo to trusted media that have signed an undertaking with the Bank. Note that the Bank did not provide embargoed access to the press release that explains the latest monetary policy decisions. One media organization breached the embargo time and published articles on two parts of the MPR: the key inputs to the projection and the section describing the evolution of our balance sheet.
We immediately contacted the organization in question and instructed them to provide an account of the circumstances surrounding the breach. In accordance with the Bank’s media policy, this organization will not have any further access to Bank embargos, lock-ups or media activities for a prescribed period."
"Bank of Canada will hold current level of policy rate until inflation objective is sustainably achieved, adjusts quantitative easing program",2021-04-21,"The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank continues to provide extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate, reinforced and supplemented by the Bank’s quantitative easing (QE) program. Effective the week of April 26, weekly net purchases of Government of Canada bonds will be adjusted to a target of $3 billion. This adjustment to the amount of incremental stimulus being added each week reflects the progress made in the economic recovery.
The outlook has improved for both the global and Canadian economies. Activity has proven more resilient than expected in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rollout of vaccines is progressing. A number of regions, including Canada, are experiencing a difficult third wave of infections and lockdowns. The more contagious variants of the virus are straining healthcare systems and affecting hard-to-distance activities, and have introduced a new dimension of uncertainty. The recovery remains highly dependent on the evolution of the pandemic and the pace of vaccinations.
Global economic growth is stronger than was forecast in the January Monetary Policy Report (MPR), although the pace varies considerably across countries. After a contraction of 2 ½ percent in 2020, the Bank now projects global GDP to grow by just over 6 ¾ percent in 2021, about 4 percent in 2022, and almost 3 ½ percent in 2023. The recovery in the United States has been particularly strong, owing to fiscal stimulus and rapid vaccine rollouts. The global recovery has lifted commodity prices, including oil, contributing to the strength of the Canadian dollar.
In Canada, growth in the first quarter appears considerably stronger than the Bank’s January forecast, as households and companies adapted to the second wave and associated restrictions. Substantial job gains in February and March boosted employment. However, new lockdowns will pose another setback and the labour market remains difficult for many Canadians, especially low-wage workers, young people and women. As vaccines roll out and the economy reopens, consumption is expected to rebound strongly in the second half of this year and remain robust over the projection. Housing construction and resales are at historic highs, driven by the desire for more living space, low mortgage rates, and limited supply. The Bank will continue to monitor the potential risks associated with the rapid rise in house prices. Meanwhile, strong growth in foreign demand and higher commodity prices are expected to drive a robust recovery in exports and business investment. Additional federal and provincial fiscal stimulus will contribute importantly to growth. The Bank now forecasts real GDP growth of 6 ½ percent in 2021, moderating to around 3 ¾ percent in 2022 and 3 ¼ percent in 2023.
The Bank has revised up its estimate of potential output in light of greater resilience to the pandemic and accelerated digitalization. The virus and lockdowns have had very different impacts across sectors, businesses, and groups of workers, creating an unusual degree of uncertainty about the amount of slack in the economy and how long it will take to be absorbed. To gauge the evolution of slack, the Bank will look at a broad spectrum of indicators, including various measures of labour market conditions.
Over the next few months, inflation is expected to rise temporarily to around the top of the 1-3 percent inflation-control range. This is largely the result of base-year effects—year-over-year CPI inflation is higher because prices of some goods and services fell sharply at the start of the pandemic. In addition, the increase in oil prices since December has driven gasoline prices above their pre-pandemic levels. The Bank expects CPI inflation to ease back toward 2 percent over the second half of 2021 as these base-year effects diminish, and inflation is expected to ease further because of the ongoing drag from excess capacity. As slack is absorbed, inflation should return to 2 per cent on a sustained basis some time in the second half of 2022. 
Even as economic prospects improve, the Governing Council judges that there is still considerable excess capacity, and the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. Based on the Bank’s latest projection, this is now expected to happen some time in the second half of 2022. The Bank is continuing its QE program to reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve. Decisions regarding further adjustments to the pace of net purchases will be guided by Governing Council’s ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of the recovery. We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is June 9, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on July 14, 2021."

University of Alberta crowned National Champion of The Governor’s Challenge,2021-02-16,"The University of Alberta has won the Bank of Canada’s sixth annual Governor’s Challenge, a national student competition in which teams simulate the role of advisor to the Bank’s Governing Council. The winners were announced following the final round on Saturday, February 13.
Governor Tiff Macklem congratulated all the participants on their grasp of the monetary policy-making process and encouraged them to consider a future career in the public service. “This is my first year taking part in the Governor’s Challenge, and I was thoroughly impressed with the calibre of presentations made by this next generation of bright economic minds,” he said. “You have so much to offer our country and I hope you consider harnessing your enthusiasm and dedication into a career that contributes to the economic well-being of Canadians.”
The Governor’s Challenge invites undergraduate students in economics and finance to develop a deeper understanding of the Canadian economy and the Bank’s role in it. Since the first competition, 39 participants have joined the Bank – one measure of the initiative’s success.
Five teams competed in the final round, each one giving a virtual presentation on the economic outlook for Canada and making a monetary policy recommendation to a panel of senior central bank officials.

"Bank of Canada will hold current level of policy rate until inflation objective is achieved, continues quantitative easing",2021-01-20,"The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance, reinforced and supplemented by its quantitative easing (QE) program, which continues at its current pace of at least $4 billion per week.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to take a severe human and economic toll in Canada and around the world. The earlier-than anticipated arrival of effective vaccines will save lives and livelihoods, and has reduced uncertainty from extreme levels. Nevertheless, uncertainty is still elevated, and the outlook remains highly conditional on the path of the virus and the timeline for the effective rollout of vaccines. 
The economic recovery has been interrupted in many countries as new waves of COVID-19 infections force governments to re-impose containment measures. However, the arrival of effective vaccines combined with further fiscal and monetary policy support have boosted the medium-term outlook for growth. In its January Monetary Policy Report (MPR), the Bank projects global growth to average just over 5 percent per year in 2021 and 2022, before slowing to just under 4 percent in 2023. Global financial markets and commodity prices have reacted positively to improving economic prospects. A broad-based decline in the US exchange rate combined with stronger commodity prices have led to a further appreciation of the Canadian dollar.
Canada’s economy had strong momentum through to late 2020, but the resurgence of cases and the reintroduction of lockdown measures are a serious setback. Growth in the first quarter of 2021 is now expected to be negative. Assuming restrictions are lifted later in the first quarter, the Bank expects a strong second-quarter rebound. Consumption is forecast to gain strength as parts of the economy reopen and confidence improves, and exports and business investment will be buoyed by rising foreign demand. Beyond the near term, the outlook for Canada is now stronger and more secure than in the October projection, thanks to earlier-than-expected availability of vaccines and significant ongoing policy stimulus. After a decline in real GDP of 5 ½ percent in 2020, the Bank projects the economy will grow by 4 percent in 2021, almost 5 percent in 2022, and around 2 ½ percent in 2023.
CPI inflation has risen to the low end of the Bank’s 1-3 percent target range in recent months, while measures of core inflation are still below 2 percent. CPI inflation is forecast to rise temporarily to around 2 percent in the first half of the year, as the base-year effects of price declines at the pandemic’s outset — mostly gasoline — dissipate. Excess supply is expected to weigh on inflation throughout the projection period. As it is absorbed, inflation is expected to return sustainably to the 2 percent target in 2023.
In view of the weakness of near-term growth and the protracted nature of the recovery, the Canadian economy will continue to require extraordinary monetary policy support. The Governing Council will hold the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In our projection, this does not happen until into 2023. To reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve, the Bank will continue its QE program until the recovery is well underway.  As the Governing Council gains confidence in the strength of the recovery, the pace of net purchases of Government of Canada bonds will be adjusted as required. We remain committed to providing the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is March 10, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on April 21, 2021.
As announced, starting with this decision the target for the overnight rate will take effect on the business day following each rate announcement."
"Bank of Canada will maintain current level of policy rate until inflation objective is achieved, continues its quantitative easing program",2020-12-09,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance, reinforced and supplemented by its quantitative easing (QE) program, which continues at its current pace of at least $4 billion per week.
The rebound in the global and Canadian economies has unfolded largely as the Bank had anticipated in its October Monetary Policy Report (MPR). More recently, news on the development of effective vaccines is providing reassurance that the pandemic will end and more normal activities will resume, although the pace and breadth of the global rollout of vaccinations remain uncertain. Near term, new waves of infections are expected to set back recoveries in many parts of the world. Accommodative policy and financial conditions are continuing to provide support across most regions. Stronger demand is pushing up prices for most commodities, including oil. A broad-based decline in the US exchange rate has contributed to a further appreciation of the Canadian dollar.
In Canada, national accounts data for the third quarter were consistent with the Bank’s expectations of a sharp economic rebound following the precipitous decline in the second quarter. The labour market continues to recoup the jobs that were lost at the start of the pandemic, albeit at a slower pace. However, activity remains highly uneven across different sectors and groups of workers. Economic momentum heading into the fourth quarter appears to be stronger than was expected in October but, in recent weeks, record high cases of COVID-19 in many parts of Canada are forcing re-imposition of restrictions. This can be expected to weigh on growth in the first quarter of 2021 and contribute to a choppy trajectory until a vaccine is widely available. The federal government’s recently announced measures should help maintain business and household incomes during this second wave of the pandemic and support the recovery. 
CPI inflation in October picked up to 0.7 percent, largely reflecting higher prices for fresh fruits and vegetables. While this suggests a slightly firmer track for inflation in the fourth quarter, the outlook for inflation remains in line with the October MPR projection. Measures of core inflation are all below 2 percent, and considerable economic slack is expected to continue to weigh on inflation for some time. 
Canada’s economic recovery will continue to require extraordinary monetary policy support. The Governing Council will hold the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In our October projection, this does not happen until into 2023. To reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve, the Bank will continue its QE program until the recovery is well underway and will adjust it as required to help bring inflation back to target on a sustainable basis. We remain committed to providing the monetary policy stimulus needed to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.

Congratulations to:
With special mention to the runner up teams:
Governor Tiff Macklem congratulated the finalists and all the students and professors who took part. “Thanks to all the participants for their ideas, teamwork and interest in the competition, despite the unique challenges this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said. “I hope they will be encouraged by this experience to continue learning about the important policy-making role played by the Bank of Canada.”"
Reminder: Changes to legal tender status will take effect in 2021,2020-11-19,"This press release was originally posted on May 31, 2019.
In accordance with amendments to the Bank of Canada Act and the Currency Act approved by Parliament in 2018, the federal government recently decided to remove legal tender status from some older bank notes as of January 1, 2021. This change will affect the $1, $2, $25, $500 and $1,000 notes, which are no longer being produced. Essentially, this means that Canadians will no longer be able to use them in transactions.
Most Canadians will not be affected because the bank notes targeted by this announcement have not been produced in decades and are rarely used in transactions.
Importantly, these bank notes will not lose their value. Canadians can redeem them at face value or decide to keep them. Those who wish to redeem their bank notes can do so most easily at their financial institution. They can also send bank notes directly to the Bank of Canada.
The Bank of Canada supports this initiative, which helps ensure that the bank notes used by Canadians are current, in good condition, easy to use and difficult to counterfeit.  
The government has indicated there are currently no plans to remove legal tender status from any other bank notes."
Bank of Canada and OSFI launch pilot project on climate risk scenarios,2020-11-16,"The Bank of Canada and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) today announced plans for a pilot project to use climate-change scenarios to better understand the risks to the financial system related to a transition to a low-carbon economy. A small group of institutions from the banking and insurance sectors will participate voluntarily in the project.
Scenario analysis is a useful tool for identifying potential risks in an environment of considerable uncertainty. Climate-change scenarios related to a transition to a low-carbon economy explore different pathways for emissions reductions – driven by changes in policy, technology, and consumer and investor preferences – and their implications for the economy and financial system.
The project aims to:
“Climate change is a major challenge for the economy, and it is accelerating. We need to accelerate our work to understand the implications for the economy and the financial system,” said Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem. “This project will generate valuable lessons for assessing and managing climate risks. With the private sector’s help, we will be able to combine climate analysis with economic and financial data to ensure we have the best information possible to fulfill our mandate.”
“Everyone, including the financial sector, will have to adjust to the new reality of climate change. The shape of that new reality will depend on many complex issues and on much that remains uncertain,” said Jeremy Rudin, Superintendent of OSFI. “This pilot project will allow us to refine our focus on the prudential aspects of climate change.”
Building on previous work on climate-change scenarios for the global economy, the Bank and OSFI will first develop a set of climate-change scenarios that are relevant for Canada. Using these scenarios, participants will explore the potential risk exposures of their balance sheets. The Bank and OSFI will publish a report, planned for the end of 2021, sharing details on the specific scenarios, methodology, assumptions and key sensitivities.
This project is not intended to serve as an assessment of individual financial institutions’ exposure to climate-related risks or the broader financial sector’s resilience to transition risks. Further, the selection of project participants is not an endorsement of their current approaches to the management or disclosure of climate risks.
The following financial institutions will participate in the project:"

Governor Macklem thanked Ms. Wilkins for her service to Canadians as Senior Deputy Governor, and throughout her career at the Bank, “Carolyn has provided exceptional leadership as an economic policymaker these past six and a half years. As Senior Deputy Governor, she has also strengthened our research, enhanced our diversity, and expanded our digital capacity. While she will be sorely missed, her many contributions will be felt by all of us for many years to come. On behalf of her colleagues on Governing Council, the Board, and everyone at the Bank, we wish her the very best and know she will make her mark in whatever she chooses to do next.”"
"Bank of Canada will maintain current level of policy rate until inflation objective is achieved, recalibrates its quantitative easing program",2020-10-28,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance, reinforced and supplemented by its quantitative easing (QE) program. The Bank is recalibrating the QE program to shift purchases towards longer-term bonds, which have more direct influence on the borrowing rates that are most important for households and businesses. At the same time, total purchases will be gradually reduced to at least $4 billion a week. The Governing Council judges that, with these combined adjustments, the QE program is providing at least as much monetary stimulus as before.
The global and Canadian economic outlooks have evolved largely as anticipated in the July Monetary Policy Report (MPR), with rapid expansions as economies reopened giving way to slower growth, despite considerable remaining excess capacity. Looking ahead, rising COVID-19 infections are likely to weigh on the economic outlook in many countries, and growth will continue to rely heavily on policy support.
In the United States, GDP growth rebounded strongly but appears to be slowing considerably. China’s economic output is back to pre-pandemic levels and its recovery continues to broaden. Emerging-market economies have been hit harder, especially those with severe outbreaks. The recovery in Europe is slowing amid mounting lockdowns. Overall, global GDP is projected to contract by about 4 percent in 2020 before growing by just over 4 ½ percent, on average, in 2021–22.
Oil prices remain about 30 percent below pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, non-energy commodity prices, on average, have more than fully recovered. Despite continued low oil prices, the Canadian dollar has appreciated since July, largely reflecting a broad-based depreciation of the US dollar. 
In Canada, the rebound in employment and GDP was stronger than expected as the economy reopened through the summer. The economy is now transitioning to a more moderate recuperation phase. In the fourth quarter, growth is expected to slow markedly, due in part to rising COVID-19 case numbers. The economic effects of the pandemic are highly uneven across sectors and are particularly affecting low-income workers. Recognizing these challenges, governments have extended and modified business and income support programs.
After a decline of about 5 ½ percent in 2020, the Bank expects Canada’s economy to grow by almost 4 percent on average in 2021 and 2022. Growth will likely be choppy as domestic demand is influenced by the evolution of the virus and its impact on consumer and business confidence. Considering the likely long-lasting effects of the pandemic, the Bank has revised down its estimate of Canada’s potential growth over the projection horizon.
CPI inflation was at 0.5 percent in September and is expected to stay below the Bank’s target band of 1 to 3 percent until early 2021, largely due to low energy prices. Measures of core inflation are all below 2 percent, consistent with an economy where demand has fallen by more than supply. Inflation is expected to remain below target throughout the projection horizon.
As the economy recuperates, it will continue to require extraordinary monetary policy support. The Governing Council will hold the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In our current projection, this does not happen until into 2023. The Bank is continuing its QE program and recalibrating it as described above. The program will continue until the recovery is well underway. We are committed to providing the monetary policy stimulus needed to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is December 9, 2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on January 20, 2021."
Central banks and BIS publish first central bank digital currency (CBDC) report laying out key requirements,2020-10-09,"A group of seven central banks together with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) today published a report identifying the foundational principles necessary for any publicly available CBDCs to help central banks meet their public policy objectives.
The report, Central bank digital currencies: foundational principles and core features, was compiled by the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, Sveriges Riksbank, the Swiss National Bank and the BIS, and highlights three key principles for a CBDC:
The group of central banks will continue to work together on CBDCs, without prejudging any decision on whether or not to introduce CBDCs in their jurisdictions.
“This report is a real step forward for this group of central banks in agreeing the common principles and identifying the key features we believe would be needed for a workable CBDC system. As well as helping central banks to meet their public policy objectives, the report provides a useful framework for how central banks provide money and support payment systems in an ever-evolving digital world. This group of central banks has built a strong international consensus which will help light the way as we each explore the case and design for CBDCs in our own jurisdictions,” said working group co-chair Sir Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England and Chair of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures.
Based on these principles, the group has identified the core features of any future CBDC system, which must be:
“A design that delivers these features can promote more resilient, efficient, inclusive and innovative payments. Although there will be no ‘one size fits all’ CBDC due to national priorities and circumstances, our report provides a springboard for further development of workable CBDCs,” said working group co-chair Benoît Cœuré, Head of the BIS Innovation Hub.
Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said: “International cooperation is essential to improve the quality of CBDCs and to ensure that they also support efficient and low-cost cross-border payments. We still have a lot of work to do before deciding to issue a CBDC in Canada. As we investigate this, we welcome engagement from the private sector and civil society since our CBDC would have to meet the needs of all Canadians.”
Further development of CBDCs requires a commitment to practical policy analysis and applied technical experimentation. While this has already started, the speed of innovation in payments and money-related technologies requires the prioritisation of collaborative experimentation.
“While technology is changing the way we pay, central banks have a duty to safeguard people’s trust in our money. Central banks must complement their domestic efforts with close cooperation to guide the exploration of central bank digital currencies to identify reliable principles and encourage innovation. The present report is a convincing proof of this international cooperation,” said Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, who chairs the group of central bank governors responsible for the report.
Future activities will include exploring other open questions around CBDCs and the challenges of cross-border payments, as well as continuing outreach domestically and with other central banks to foster informed dialogue on key issues. Work by the BIS Innovation Hub, which serves the broader central banking community, will contribute to this objective."
Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn A. Wilkins will not seek second term,2020-09-17,"The Board of Directors of the Bank of Canada announced today that Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn A. Wilkins informed them that she will not seek a second term. Her current term runs to May 1, 2021. The Board will initiate a search process to select her successor. 
“It has been a great honour and privilege to serve Canadians in this role, and throughout my 20 years at the Bank,” Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins said. “My time at the Bank has been the most fulfilling period of my career – a testament to the many dedicated and talented colleagues, both at home and abroad, that I have been fortunate to work with.”
The Senior Deputy Governor thanked past and present members of the Bank’s Board of Directors, former Governor Stephen Poloz, and current Governor Tiff Macklem for the confidence that they have shown in her over the years.
“Building and carrying out a shared vision for the Bank with Governor Poloz has been a professional highlight. I’ve also enjoyed working closely again with Governor Macklem. The Bank is in good hands.”
The Board’s lead independent director, Claire Kennedy, said the Senior Deputy Governor has served the Bank and Canadians with distinction. “Through her leadership and innovative approach to the role of Senior Deputy Governor, Carolyn has made an invaluable contribution to the economic and financial welfare of all Canadians. Most recently, she led the development and implementation of the Bank’s asset purchase programs. These programs have helped Canadians bridge a very difficult period and are supporting the economic recovery.”
The following is the process to appoint a new Senior Deputy Governor:"
"Bank of Canada maintains commitment to current level of policy rate, continues program of quantitative easing",2020-09-09,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly ½ percent and the deposit rate is ¼ percent. The Bank is also continuing its quantitative easing (QE) program, with large-scale asset purchases of at least $5 billion per week of Government of Canada bonds.
Both the global and Canadian economies are evolving broadly in line with the scenario in the July Monetary Policy Report (MPR), with activity bouncing back as countries lift containment measures. The Bank continues to expect this strong reopening phase to be followed by a protracted and uneven recuperation phase, which will be heavily reliant on policy support. The pace of the recovery remains highly dependent on the path of the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolution of social distancing measures required to contain its spread.
The rebound in the United States has been stronger than expected, while economic performance among emerging markets has been more mixed. Global financial conditions have remained accommodative. Although prices for some commodities have firmed, oil prices remain weak.
In Canada, real GDP fell by 11.5 percent (39 percent annualized) in the second quarter, resulting in a decline of just over 13 percent in the first half of the year, largely in line with the Bank’s July MPR central scenario. All components of aggregate demand weakened, as expected.
As the economy reopens, the bounce-back in activity in the third quarter looks to be faster than anticipated in July. Economic activity has been supported by government programs to replace incomes and subsidize wages. Core funding markets are functioning well, and this has led to a decline in the use of the Bank’s short-term liquidity programs. Monetary policy is working to support household spending and business investment by making borrowing more affordable.
Household spending rebounded sharply over the summer, with stronger-than-expected goods consumption and housing activity largely reflecting pent-up demand. There has also been a large but uneven rebound in employment. Exports are recovering in response to strengthening foreign demand, but are still well below pre-pandemic levels. Business confidence and investment remain subdued. While recent data during the reopening phase is encouraging, the Bank continues to expect the recuperation phase to be slow and choppy as the economy copes with ongoing uncertainty and structural challenges.
CPI inflation is close to zero, with downward pressure from energy prices and travel services, and is expected to remain well below target in the near term. Measures of core inflation are between 1.3 percent and 1.9 percent, reflecting the large degree of economic slack, with the core measure most influenced by services prices showing the weakest growth.
As the economy moves from reopening to recuperation, it will continue to require extraordinary monetary policy support. The Governing Council will hold the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. To reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve, the Bank is continuing its large-scale asset purchase program at the current pace. This QE program will continue until the recovery is well underway and will be calibrated to provide the monetary policy stimulus needed to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is October 28, 2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."
Bank of Canada launches public consultation on inflation targeting,2020-08-24,
Bank of Canada designates Interac e‑Transfer as a prominent payment system,2020-08-10,"Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem has designated Interac e‑Transfer ® as a prominent payment system under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act, effective August 10, 2020. This brings Bank oversight to this payment system and ensures it remains a safe, viable and effective method of payment for Canadians.
The Bank regularly monitors the evolution of new and existing payment systems to determine whether they warrant oversight because of their potential to cause systemic or payment system risk. Designating Interac e‑Transfer as a prominent payment system means it must adhere to the Bank's risk management standards, including having risk controls in place to ensure continued resilience.
Interac e‑Transfer has become central to the Canadian payments system. In the 2019 fiscal year, the Interac system facilitated over 486 million transactions, totalling $169 billion. A disruption or failure of the Interac e‑Transfer system could cause a significant adverse effect on economic activity in Canada, potentially leading to a general loss of confidence in the overall Canadian payments system.
The Interac e‑Transfer system is operated by Interac Corp. Launched in 2003, Interac e‑Transfer enables individuals and businesses with a Canadian bank account at participating financial institutions to electronically send or receive payments within Canada—24 hours a day, 7 days a week."

"Bank of Canada will maintain current level of policy rate until inflation objective is achieved, continues program of quantitative easing",2020-07-15,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly ½ percent and the deposit rate is ¼ percent. The Bank is also continuing its quantitative easing (QE) program, with large-scale asset purchases of at least $5 billion per week of Government of Canada bonds. The Bank’s short-term liquidity programs announced since March to improve market functioning are having their intended effect and, with reduced market strains, their use has declined. The provincial and corporate bond purchase programs will continue as announced. The Bank stands ready to adjust its programs if market conditions warrant.
While economies are re-opening, the global and Canadian outlook is extremely uncertain, given the unpredictability of the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reflecting this, the Bank’s July Monetary Policy Report (MPR) presents a central scenario for global and Canadian growth rather than the usual economic projections. The central scenario is based on assumptions outlined in the MPR, including that there is no widespread second wave of the virus.
After a sharp drop in the first half of 2020, global economic activity is picking up. This return to growth reflects the relaxation of necessary containment measures put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus, combined with extraordinary fiscal and monetary policy support. As a result, financial conditions have improved. The prices of most commodities, including oil, have risen from very low levels. In the central scenario, the global economy overall shrinks by about 5 percent in 2020 and then grows by around 5 percent on average in 2021 and 2022. The timing and pace of the recovery varies among regions and could be hampered by a resurgence of infections and the limited capacity of some countries to contain the virus or support their economies.
The Canadian economy is starting to recover as it re-opens from the shutdowns needed to limit the virus spread. With economic activity in the second quarter estimated to have been 15 percent below its level at the end of 2019, this is the deepest decline in economic activity since the Great Depression, but considerably less severe than the worst scenarios presented in the April MPR. Decisive and necessary fiscal and monetary policy actions have supported incomes and kept credit flowing, cushioning the fall and laying the foundation for recovery. Since early June, the government has announced additional support programs, and extended others.
There are early signs that the reopening of businesses and pent-up demand are leading to an initial bounce-back in employment and output. In the central scenario, roughly 40 percent of the collapse in the first half of the year is made up in the third quarter. Subsequently, the Bank expects the economy’s recuperation to slow as the pandemic continues to affect confidence and consumer behaviour and as the economy works through structural challenges. As a result, in the central scenario, real GDP declines by 7.8 percent in 2020 and resumes with growth of 5.1 percent in 2021 and 3.7 percent in 2022. The Bank expects economic slack to persist as the recovery in demand lags that of supply, creating significant disinflationary pressures.
CPI inflation is close to zero, pulled down by sharp declines in components such as gasoline and travel services. The Bank’s core measures of inflation have drifted down, although by much less than the CPI, and are now between 1.4 and 1.9 percent. Inflation is expected to remain weak before gradually strengthening toward 2 percent as the drag from low gas prices and other temporary effects dissipates and demand recovers, reducing economic slack. 
As the economy moves from reopening to recuperation, it will continue to require extraordinary monetary policy support. The Governing Council will hold the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In addition, to reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve, the Bank is continuing its large-scale asset purchase program at a pace of at least $5 billion per week of Government of Canada bonds. This QE program is making borrowing more affordable for households and businesses and will continue until the recovery is well underway. To support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective, the Bank is prepared to provide further monetary stimulus as needed.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is September 9, 2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on October 28, 2020."
Bank of Canada partners with the Bank for International Settlements to launch innovation centre,2020-06-30,"The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Bank of Canada announced today they will be launching a BIS Innovation Hub centre to advance fintech innovation within the central banking community. The centre will open in Toronto within two years and is one of four locations scheduled to open in North America and Europe.
This partnership will advance the Bank’s understanding of the digital economy and the technological transformation of financial services. It builds on the Bank’s existing research and collaboration with partners in the central bank and technology communities on digital currencies and fintech.
“We’re proud to host a BIS innovation centre in Toronto and to strengthen our collaboration with other central banks and the private sector on digital technologies,” said Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem. “This partnership will allow the Bank to continue its work on behalf of Canadians to explore how technology will shape the future of our economy and financial system.”
 “Toronto is an ideal location for a regional BIS innovation centre,” said Eric Santor, Advisor to the Governor on Digitalization. “The centre will be well-placed to identify key technology trends and contribute to the development of innovative solutions to benefit and enhance the global financial system.”"
Bank of Canada becomes administrator of Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average,2020-06-15,"The Bank of Canada is now the administrator of the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) and will post today the first rate calculated using an improved methodology. The Bank publishes this important Canadian interest rate benchmark on its website at no cost and as a public good. The Bank is also committed to ensuring that CORRA is:
“The publication of CORRA by the Bank today is an important milestone in the collaborative efforts between the Canadian financial industry and the Bank to reform interest rate benchmarks and make financial markets even safer,” said Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Toni Gravelle. “We expect that over time CORRA will become the dominant Canadian benchmark used across a wide range of financial products.”
Information on the calculation methodology, publishing process, terms of use and governance structure for CORRA is available on the Bank website, along with a historical data series. CORRA is still available to users through various data distributors and existing infrastructure.
To prepare for this new role, the Bank worked closely with the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada, which provides the data that the Bank is using to calculate CORRA. The Bank also worked closely with industry participants through the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate Working Group and its subgroups.

"Bank of Canada maintains target for the overnight rate, scales back some market operations as financial conditions improve",2020-06-03,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly ½ percent and the deposit rate is ¼ percent.
Incoming data confirm the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy. This impact appears to have peaked, although uncertainty about how the recovery will unfold remains high. Massive policy responses in advanced economies have helped to replace lost income and cushion the effect of economic shutdowns. Financial conditions have improved, and commodity prices have risen in recent weeks after falling sharply earlier this year. Because different countries’ containment measures will be lifted at different times, the global recovery likely will be protracted and uneven.  
In Canada, the pandemic has led to historic losses in output and jobs. Still, the Canadian economy appears to have avoided the most severe scenario presented in the Bank’s April Monetary Policy Report (MPR). The level of real GDP in the first quarter was 2.1 percent lower than in the fourth quarter of 2019. This GDP reading is in the middle of the Bank’s April monitoring range and reflects the combined impact of falling oil prices and widespread shutdowns. The level of real GDP in the second quarter will likely show a further decline of 10-20 percent, as continued shutdowns and sharply lower investment in the energy sector take a further toll on output. Decisive and targeted fiscal actions, combined with lower interest rates, are buffering the impact of the shutdown on disposable income and helping to lay the foundation for economic recovery. While the outlook for the second half of 2020 and beyond remains heavily clouded, the Bank expects the economy to resume growth in the third quarter.
CPI inflation has decreased to near zero, as anticipated in the April MPR, mainly due to lower prices for gasoline. The Bank expects temporary factors to keep CPI inflation below the target band in the near term. The Bank’s core measures of inflation have drifted down, although by much less than the CPI, and are now between 1.6 and 2 percent.
The Bank’s programs to improve market function are having their intended effect. After significant strains in March, short-term funding conditions have improved. Therefore, the Bank is reducing the frequency of its term repo operations to once per week, and its program to purchase bankers’ acceptances to bi-weekly operations. The Bank stands ready to adjust these programs if market conditions warrant. Meanwhile, its other programs to purchase federal, provincial, and corporate debt are continuing at their present frequency and scope.
As market function improves and containment restrictions ease, the Bank’s focus will shift to supporting the resumption of growth in output and employment. The Bank maintains its commitment to continue large-scale asset purchases until the economic recovery is well underway. Any further policy actions would be calibrated to provide the necessary degree of monetary policy accommodation required to achieve the inflation target.
Tiff Macklem assumes his role as the Bank’s tenth Governor today. He participated as an observer in Governing Council’s deliberations for this policy interest rate decision and endorses the rate decision and measures announced in this press release.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is July 15, 2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."
Tiff Macklem Appointed Governor of the Bank of Canada,2020-05-01,"The Directors of the Bank of Canada, appointed under Section 9 of the Bank of Canada Act, today announced that they have appointed Tiff Macklem as Governor of the Bank of Canada for a seven-year term, effective 3 June 2020. Mr. Macklem will succeed Stephen S. Poloz, who is leaving the Bank of Canada on 2 June 2020.
""After pursuing an exhaustive domestic and international selection process for this crucial role, I'm delighted to say that Tiff Macklem has the exceptional qualities to fulfil this role,” said Claire Kennedy, Chair of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors. ""Tiff has deep knowledge of monetary policy and financial stability issues, a proven crisis management track record, and extensive senior leadership experience. We are confident Tiff will make an outstanding contribution to promoting the economic and financial welfare of Canada, and to upholding the Bank’s exemplary reputation as a leading central bank.”
A native of Montréal, Quebec, Mr. Macklem has been Dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto since July 2014. Prior to that, he served as the Senior Deputy Governor at the Bank of Canada between July 2010 and May 2014. Before his appointment as Senior Deputy Governor, Mr. Macklem was Associate Deputy Minister at the Department of Finance, serving as Canada's representative at the G7, G20 and Financial Stability Board. Mr. Macklem first joined the Bank in 1984 and occupied increasingly senior positions until he was appointed Advisor to the Governor in August 2003. In 2003-4, he was seconded to the Department of Finance, before returning to the Bank as Deputy Governor in December 2004. Mr. Macklem graduated from Queen's University in 1983 with a bachelor's degree in economics, and completed a master’s degree and a PhD in economics from the University of Western Ontario.
On behalf of the directors, Ms. Kennedy thanked Governor Poloz for his dedicated service and his leadership in promoting the economic and financial well being of Canada throughout his tenure. She also thanked him for the important contributions he has made to the global policy dialogue, which are being brought to bear in the current challenging circumstances. On behalf of Canadians, the Board expressed its appreciation for Governor Poloz's distinguished career at the Bank of Canada, the legacy of which will continue to serve our country well."
Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target and unveils new market operations,2020-04-15,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at ¼ percent, which the Bank considers its effective lower bound. The Bank Rate is correspondingly ½ percent and the deposit rate is ¼ percent. The Bank also announced new measures to provide additional support to Canada’s financial system.
The necessary efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic have caused a sudden and deep contraction in economic activity and employment worldwide. In financial markets, this has driven a flight to safety and a sharp repricing of a wide range of assets. It has also pushed down prices for commodities, especially oil. In this environment, the Canadian dollar has depreciated since January, although by less than many other currencies. The sudden halt in global activity will be followed by regional recoveries at different times, depending on the duration and severity of the outbreak in each region. This means that the global economic recovery, when it comes, could be protracted and uneven.
The Canadian economy was in a solid position ahead of the COVID-19 outbreak, but has since been hit by widespread shutdowns and lower oil prices. One early measure of the extent of the damage was an unprecedented drop in employment in March, with more than one million jobs lost across Canada. Many more workers reported shorter hours, and by early April some six million Canadians had applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.
The outlook is too uncertain at this point to provide a complete forecast. However, Bank analysis of alternative scenarios suggests the level of real activity was down 1-3 percent in the first quarter of 2020, and will be 15-30 percent lower in the second quarter than in fourth-quarter 2019. CPI inflation is expected to be close to 0 percent in the second quarter of 2020. This is primarily due to the transitory effects of lower gasoline prices.
The pandemic-driven contraction has prompted decisive policy action to support individuals and businesses and to lay the foundation for economic recovery once containment measures start to ease. Fiscal programs, designed to expand according to the magnitude of the shock, will help individuals and businesses weather this shutdown phase of the pandemic, and support incomes and confidence leading into the recovery. These programs have been complemented by actions taken by other federal agencies and provincial governments.
For its part, the Bank of Canada has taken measures to improve market function so that monetary policy actions have their intended effect on the economy. This helps ensure that households and businesses continue to have access to the credit they need to bridge this difficult time, and that lower interest rates find their way to ultimate borrowers. The Bank has lowered its target for the overnight rate 150 basis points over the last three weeks, to its effective lower bound. It has also conducted lending operations to financial institutions and asset purchases in core funding markets amounting to around $200 billion.
These actions have served to ease market dysfunction and help keep credit channels open, although they remain strained. The next challenge for markets will be managing increased demand for near-term financing by federal and provincial governments, and businesses and households. The situation calls for special actions by the central bank. To this end, the Bank is furthering its efforts with several important steps.
Under its previously-announced program, the Bank will continue to purchase at least $5 billion in Government of Canada securities per week in the secondary market, and will increase the level of purchases as required to maintain proper functioning of the government bond market. Also, the Bank is temporarily increasing the amount of Treasury Bills it acquires at auctions to up to 40 percent, effective immediately.
The Bank is also announcing today the development of a new Provincial Bond Purchase Program of up to $50 billion, to supplement its Provincial Money Market Purchase Program. Further, the Bank is announcing a new Corporate Bond Purchase Program, in which the Bank will acquire up to a total of $10 billion in investment grade corporate bonds in the secondary market. Both of these programs will be put in place in the coming weeks. Finally, the Bank is further enhancing its term repo facility to permit funding for up to 24 months.
These measures will work in combination to ease pressure on Canadian borrowers. As containment restrictions are eased and economic activity resumes, fiscal and monetary policy actions will help underpin confidence and stimulate spending by consumers and businesses to restore growth. The Bank’s Governing Council stands ready to adjust the scale or duration of its programs if necessary. All the Bank’s actions are aimed at helping to bridge the current period of containment and create the conditions for a sustainable recovery and achievement of the inflation target over time.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is June 3, 2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on July 15, 2020."
Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target to ¼ percent,2020-03-27,"The Bank of Canada today lowered its target for the overnight rate by 50 basis points to ¼ percent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly ½ percent and the deposit rate is ¼ percent. This unscheduled rate decision brings the policy rate to its effective lower bound and is intended to provide support to the Canadian financial system and the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The spread of COVID-19 is having serious consequences for Canadians and for the economy, as is the abrupt decline in world oil prices. The pandemic-driven contraction has prompted decisive fiscal policy action in Canada to support individuals and businesses and to minimize any permanent damage to the structure of the economy.
The Bank is playing an important complementary role in this effort. Its interest rate setting cushions the impact of the shocks by easing the cost of borrowing. Its efforts to maintain the functioning of the financial system are helping keep credit available to people and companies. The intent of our decision today is to support the financial system in its central role of providing credit in the economy, and to lay the foundation for the economy’s return to normalcy.
The Bank’s efforts have been primarily focused on ensuring the availability of credit by providing liquidity to help markets continue to function.  To promote credit availability, the Bank has expanded its various term repo facilities. To preserve market function, the Bank is conducting Government of Canada bond buybacks and switches, purchases of Canada Mortgage Bonds and banker’s acceptances, and purchases of provincial money market instruments. All these additional measures have been detailed on the Bank’s website and will be extended or augmented as needed.
Today, the Bank is launching two new programs.
First, the Commercial Paper Purchase Program (CPPP) will help to alleviate strains in short-term funding markets and thereby preserve a key source of funding for businesses. Details of the program will be available on the Bank’s web site.
Second, to address strains in the Government of Canada debt market and to enhance the effectiveness of all other actions taken so far, the Bank will begin acquiring Government of Canada securities in the secondary market. Purchases will begin with a minimum of $5 billion per week, across the yield curve. The program will be adjusted as conditions warrant, but will continue until the economic recovery is well underway. The Bank’s balance sheet will expand as a result of these purchases.
The Bank is closely monitoring economic and financial conditions, in coordination with other G7 central banks and fiscal authorities, and will update its outlook in mid-April. As the situation evolves, Governing Council stands ready to take further action as required to support the Canadian economy and financial system and to keep inflation on target.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is April 15, 2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."
Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target to ¾ percent,2020-03-13,"The Bank of Canada today lowered its target for the overnight rate by 50 basis points to ¾ percent, effective Monday, March 16, 2020. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 percent and the deposit rate is ½ percent. This unscheduled rate decision is a proactive measure taken in light of the negative shocks to Canada’s economy arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent sharp drop in oil prices.
It is clear that the spread of the coronavirus is having serious consequences for Canadian families, and for Canada’s economy. In addition, lower prices for oil, even since our last scheduled rate decision on March 4, will weigh heavily on the economy, particularly in energy intensive regions.
The Bank will provide a full update of its outlook for the Canadian and global economies on April 15. As the situation evolves, Governing Council stands ready to adjust monetary policy further if required to support economic growth and keep inflation on target.
The Bank has also taken steps to ensure that the Canadian financial system has sufficient liquidity. These additional measures have been announced in separate notices on the Bank’s website.

Bank of Canada announces members of Advisory Council for next $5 bank note,2020-03-09,
Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target to 1 ¼ percent,2020-03-04,"The Bank of Canada today lowered its target for the overnight rate by 50 basis points to 1 ¼ percent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 ½ percent and the deposit rate is 1 percent.
While Canada’s economy has been operating close to potential with inflation on target, the COVID-19 virus is a material negative shock to the Canadian and global outlooks, and monetary and fiscal authorities are responding.
Before the outbreak, the global economy was showing signs of stabilizing, as the Bank had projected in its January Monetary Policy Report (MPR). However, COVID-19 represents a significant health threat to people in a growing number of countries. In consequence, business activity in some regions has fallen sharply and supply chains have been disrupted. This has pulled down commodity prices and the Canadian dollar has depreciated. Global markets are reacting to the spread of the virus by repricing risk across a broad set of assets, making financial conditions less accommodative. It is likely that as the virus spreads, business and consumer confidence will deteriorate, further depressing activity.
In Canada, GDP growth slowed to 0.3 percent during the fourth quarter of 2019, in line with the Bank’s forecast, although its composition was different. Consumption was stronger than expected, supported by healthy labour income growth. Residential investment continued to grow, albeit at a more moderate pace than earlier in the year. Meanwhile, both business investment and exports weakened.
It is becoming clear that the first quarter of 2020 will be weaker than the Bank had expected. The drop in Canada’s terms of trade, if sustained, will weigh on income growth. Meanwhile, business investment does not appear to be recovering as was expected following positive trade policy developments. In addition, rail line blockades, strikes by Ontario teachers, and winter storms in some regions are dampening economic activity in the first quarter.
CPI inflation in January was stronger than expected, due to temporary factors. Core measures of inflation all remain around 2 percent, consistent with an economy that has been operating close to potential.
In light of all these developments, the outlook is clearly weaker now than it was in January. As the situation evolves, Governing Council stands ready to adjust monetary policy further if required to support economic growth and keep inflation on target. While markets continue to function well, the Bank will continue to ensure that the Canadian financial system has sufficient liquidity.
The Bank continues to closely monitor economic and financial conditions, in coordination with other G7 central banks and fiscal authorities.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is April 15, 2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."

Bank of Canada to begin publishing Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average in June,2020-02-18,"The Bank of Canada will take over the responsibility for publishing the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA), effective Monday, June 15, 2020.
Beginning on this date, the Bank will provide this key interest rate benchmark for financial markets, at no cost, and make it available on the Bank’s website as a public good.
CORRA for a given day will be published to the Bank’s website on the morning of the following business day. This means that the Bank’s first publication of CORRA on June 15 will be the rate for Friday, June 12, 2020.
As announced in July 2019, the Bank will become the administrator for CORRA, taking over from the current administrator, Refinitiv Benchmark Services (UK) Limited.

University of British Columbia crowned National Champion of The Governor’s Challenge,2020-02-10,"The University of British Columbia has won the Bank of Canada’s fifth annual Governor’s Challenge, a national student competition in which teams simulate the role of advisor to the Bank’s Governing Council. The winners were announced following the final round in Ottawa on Saturday, February 8.
Governor Stephen S. Poloz, who awarded the championship trophy, congratulated the University of British Columbia and encouraged all the participants to continue their studies in economics and see where they can make their contribution. He told the finalists, “Whether your career takes you to private industry or public service, remember that economics is, above all, about people. Working in a profession where you get the opportunity to help improve the lives of your fellow citizens is a noble calling.”
The Governor’s Challenge invites the next generation of Canadian economists to develop a deeper understanding of the Canadian economy and the Bank’s role in it. Since the first competition, over 30 participants have joined the Bank — proving the initiative’s value as an opportunity for young people to contribute to the economic well-being of Canadians.
Five teams competed in the final round, each one giving a presentation on the economic outlook for Canada and making a monetary policy recommendation to a panel of senior central bank officials.

Bank of Canada launches public consultation for new $5 bank note,2020-01-29,"Minister of Finance Bill Morneau and Governor Stephen S. Poloz today announced that the Bank of Canada is launching public consultations to select an iconic Canadian to appear on the next $5 bank note. Canadians can submit nominations by using the Bank of Canada’s submission form by March 11, 2020.
This call for nominations is similar to the Bank’s 2016 campaign that resulted in the selection of Viola Desmond, a defender of human rights and social justice, as the portrait subject of the vertical $10 bank note. The redesigned $10 bill won the Bank Note of the Year Award from the International Bank Note Society.
""When we launched the last round of consultations, we never could have anticipated the enthusiasm of Canadians, both for the process or for the historic bank note that featured a Canadian woman for the first time, civil rights pioneer Viola Desmond,” said Minister of Finance Bill Morneau. “We’re excited to see who the public will nominate for the $5 bank note and look forward to celebrating another incredible Canadian.”
Governor Poloz encouraged Canadians from all parts of the country to nominate people who have inspired them and to talk about their achievements.
“This open call for nominations is another great opportunity to highlight the many stories of heroes, sometimes unsung ones, who have helped shape the Canada we live in today,” he noted. “I hope this process sparks conversations and encourages us all to learn more about our great country and its remarkable people.”
An independent advisory council composed of eminent people from academia, the cultural sector and civil society will review all nominations who meet the criteria outlined below. With the support of historical and public opinion research, the advisory council will develop a short list of candidates for submission to the Minister of Finance. The Minister will announce his decision on the portrait subject of the new $5 bank note later this year. The Bank of Canada will then begin the design process for the new bank note.
Nominees must meet all the following criteria:"
Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1 ¾ percent,2019-07-10,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1 ¾ percent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 2 percent and the deposit rate is 1 ½ percent.
Evidence has been accumulating that ongoing trade tensions are having a material effect on the global economic outlook. The Bank had already incorporated such negative effects in previous Monetary Policy Reports (MPR) and in this forecast has made further adjustments in light of weaker sentiment and activity in major economies. Trade conflicts between the United States and China, in particular, are curbing manufacturing activity and business investment and pushing down commodity prices.
Policy is responding to the slowdown: central banks in the US and Europe have signalled their readiness to provide more accommodative monetary policy and further policy stimulus has been implemented in China. In this context, global financial conditions have eased substantially. The Bank now expects global GDP to grow by 3 percent in 2019 and to strengthen to around 3 ¼ percent in 2020 and 2021, with the US slowing to a pace near its potential. Escalation of trade conflicts remains the biggest downside risk to the global and Canadian outlooks.
Following temporary weakness in late 2018 and early 2019, Canada’s economy is returning to growth around potential, as expected. Growth in the second quarter appears to be stronger than predicted due to some temporary factors, including the reversal of weather-related slowdowns in the first quarter and a surge in oil production. Consumption is being supported by a healthy labour market. At the national level, the housing market is stabilizing, although there are still significant adjustments underway in some regions. A material decline in longer-term mortgage rates is supporting housing activity. Exports rebounded in the second quarter and will grow moderately as foreign demand continues to expand. However, ongoing trade conflicts and competitiveness challenges are dampening the outlook for trade and investment. The Bank projects real GDP growth to average 1.3 percent in 2019 and about 2 percent in 2020 and 2021.
Inflation remains around the 2 percent target, with some recent upward pressure from higher food and automobile prices. Core measures of inflation are also close to 2 percent. CPI inflation will likely dip this year because of the dynamics of gasoline prices and some other temporary factors. As slack in the economy is absorbed and these temporary effects wane, inflation is expected to return sustainably to 2 percent by mid-2020.
Recent data show the Canadian economy is returning to potential growth. However, the outlook is clouded by persistent trade tensions. Taken together, the degree of accommodation being provided by the current policy interest rate remains appropriate. As Governing Council continues to monitor incoming data, it will pay particular attention to developments in the energy sector and the impact of trade conflicts on the prospects for Canadian growth and inflation.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is September 4, 2019. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on October 30, 2019."

Bank of Canada announces Deputy Governor  and Special Advisor appointments,2019-09-19,"The Board of Directors of the Bank of Canada today announced the appointment of Toni Gravelle as Deputy Governor, effective October 1, 2019. Mr. Gravelle’s appointment fills the vacancy created by the retirement of Lynn Patterson in July 2019.
As Deputy Governor, Mr. Gravelle will join the Bank’s Governing Council, which sets the strategic direction of the Bank and is its policy-making body. Mr. Gravelle will share responsibility for overseeing the Bank’s financial system activities with Deputy Governor Paul Beaudry.
“We are delighted to welcome Toni Gravelle to Governing Council.

Mr. Gravelle was born in North Bay, Ontario, and holds a bachelor’s degree and a PhD in Economics from Western University.
The Bank also today announced that Mark Hardisty will join the Bank as Special Advisor to the Governor for a two-year term beginning November 6, 2019. As the senior representative for financial markets at the Bank’s Toronto Regional Office, Mr. Hardisty will lead a team that is responsible for maintaining strong relationships with the Toronto financial community and contributing to the Bank’s analysis of financial markets, institutions, products and regulations.
“Mark Hardisty is a superb addition to the Bank’s leadership team,” said Governor Poloz. “Mark’s broad experience and extensive network will help us interpret capital market developments and communicate our views and policies to market participants.

Bank of Canada to become the administrator of key interest rate benchmark,2019-07-16,"The Bank of Canada today announced its intention to become the administrator of the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA), a key interest rate benchmark for financial markets. The Bank will take over this role from the current administrator, Refinitiv, when enhancements to CORRA take effect next year. The Bank will provide the rate as a public good, at no cost. This is in line with developments in other major economies.
In Canada, close to $12 trillion dollars of financial instruments are linked to benchmark interest rates, including CORRA. Today’s announcement is part of Canada’s contribution to a global reform effort to promote the use of risk-free rate benchmarks that are robust, reliable and resilient to market stress.
To that end, the Bank has worked closely with industry participants through the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate Working Group (CARR) to improve the methodology for calculating CORRA. CORRA will be based on a wider set of transaction data provided by the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada. The result will be a highly credible benchmark that is more representative of the Canadian market for repurchase agreements (repos) and consistent with global best practices. The target date for implementing the enhanced methodology is the second quarter of 2020.
“The Bank expects that, over time, CORRA will be further adopted across a wide range of financial products and could potentially become the dominant Canadian interest rate benchmark, particularly in derivatives markets,” said Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Lynn Patterson. “It is very gratifying to see representatives of the public and private sectors come together to make real progress on our shared goal of making Canadian financial markets more resilient and efficient.”
CARR will work with stakeholders in the coming months to ensure preparedness and to confirm the timeline for implementation. It will also form a new subgroup that will develop a publishing process for CORRA and a comprehensive governance structure, including regular reviews of the methodology. The Bank is committed to ensuring CORRA is consistent with the Principles for Financial Benchmarks set out by the International Organization of Securities Commissions.
Market participants interested in participating in the efforts to help the financial system transition to CORRA should reach out to the CARR secretariat.

Bank of Canada announces partnership to improve resilience in financial sector,2019-06-27,"The Bank of Canada today announced the launch of a public-private partnership to strengthen the resilience of Canada’s financial sector in the face of risks to business operations, including cyber incidents. The Canadian Financial Sector Resiliency Group (CFRG) will be responsible for coordinating a sector-wide response to systemic-level operational incidents. CFRG will also support ongoing resiliency initiatives, such as regular crisis simulation and benchmarking exercises. These efforts will reduce risk and help ensure a robust recovery in the event of an incident. The CFRG will start its work in August 2019.
Led by the Bank of Canada, this initiative brings together the following organizations:
While the increased interconnectedness of the financial sector brings many benefits, it also means that an incident in one institution may spread to others and be amplified. Should an incident, such as a major cyber attack, threaten the operations of the financial sector’s critical infrastructure, the CFRG will coordinate the national response. Each member organization’s highest officials will be involved in crisis coordination.
“We need strong controls within each institution. And we need partnerships between public agencies and the private sector to bridge any gaps in coordination, especially when it comes to cyber risks,” said Bank of Canada Governor Stephen S. Poloz. “The CFRG brings together many of our trusted partners to work with us making our financial system safe and resilient.”
“Operational risks—including cyber attacks—are real, and they pose a threat to the payments system and in fact the entire financial system,” said Brian Porter, Chief Executive Officer of Scotiabank. “We look forward to working with the Bank of Canada and organizations across the sector to build a more resilient, more robust financial system that better protects our customers against new threats.”"
Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1 ¾ per cent,2018-12-05,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1 ¾ per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1 ½ per cent.
The global economic expansion is moderating largely as expected, but signs are emerging that trade conflicts are weighing more heavily on global demand. Recent encouraging developments at the G20 meetings are a reminder that there are upside as well as downside risks around trade policy. Growth in major advanced economies has slowed, although activity in the United States remains above potential.
Oil prices have fallen sharply since the October Monetary Policy Report (MPR), reflecting a combination of geopolitical developments, uncertainty about global growth prospects, and expansion of U.S. shale oil production. Benchmarks for western Canadian oil – both heavy and, more recently, light – have been pulled down even further by transportation constraints and a buildup of inventories. In light of these developments and associated cutbacks in production, activity in Canada’s energy sector will likely be materially weaker than expected.
The Canadian economy as a whole grew in line with the Bank’s projection in the third quarter, although data suggest less momentum going into the fourth quarter. Business investment fell in the third quarter, in large part due to heightened trade uncertainty during the summer. Business investment outside the energy sector is expected to strengthen with the signing of the USMCA, new federal government tax measures, and ongoing capacity constraints. Along with strong foreign demand, this increase in productive capacity should support continued growth in exports.
Household credit and regional housing markets appear to be stabilizing following a significant slowdown in recent quarters. The Bank continues to monitor the impact on both builders and buyers of tighter mortgage rules, regional housing policy changes, and higher interest rates.
Inflation has been evolving as expected and the Bank’s core measures are all tracking 2 per cent, consistent with an economy that has been operating close to its capacity. CPI inflation, at 2.4 per cent in October, is just above target but is expected to ease in coming months by more than the Bank had previously forecast, due to lower gasoline prices. Downward historical revisions by Statistics Canada to GDP, together with recent macroeconomic developments, indicate there may be additional room for non-inflationary growth. The Bank will reassess all of these factors in its new projection for the January MPR.
Weighing all of these developments, Governing Council continues to judge that the policy interest rate will need to rise into a neutral range to achieve the inflation target. The appropriate pace of rate increases will depend on a number of factors. These include the effect of higher interest rates on consumption and housing, and global trade policy developments. The persistence of the oil price shock, the evolution of business investment, and the Bank’s assessment of the economy’s capacity will also factor importantly into our decisions about the future stance of monetary policy. 
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is January 9, 2019. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."

Bank of Canada Announces Deputy Governor Appointment,2016-02-23,"The Board of Directors of the Bank of Canada today announced the appointment of Sylvain Leduc as Deputy Governor, effective 2 May 2016. Mr. Leduc’s appointment, which is the result of an open search process, fills the vacancy created by the retirement of Agathe Côté in January.
As Deputy Governor, Mr. Leduc will join the Bank’s Governing Council, which is the policy-making body of the Bank. The Governing Council is responsible for decisions with respect to monetary policy and financial system stability and for setting the strategic direction of the Bank.
“Sylvain Leduc’s central banking experience and deep understanding of the international monetary system make him an exceptional addition to the Bank’s Governing Council,” said Governor Stephen S. Poloz. “His expertise in economic modelling and policy will complement the skills and experience of his fellow Deputy Governors. My colleagues and I warmly welcome Sylvain to the Bank.”
A renowned and prolific researcher, Mr. Leduc is currently Vice President, Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Research at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. He has worked at the San Francisco Fed since 2008 and before that occupied increasingly senior positions at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, D.C.
Born in Montréal, Quebec, Mr. Leduc received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in economics from McGill University and obtained a PhD in economics from the University of Rochester. He has served as Editorial Advisor for the Canadian Journal of Economics.
With today’s appointment, Governor Poloz and Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins also announced a reallocation of responsibilities among the Deputy Governors. Mr. Leduc will share responsibility with Deputy Governor Lynn Patterson for overseeing the Bank’s financial system activities, while Deputy Governors Tim Lane and Larry Schembri share responsibility for overseeing the Bank’s analysis of international and domestic economic developments in support of monetary policy decisions."
New exhibition on Viola Desmond opens at Bank of Canada Museum,2018-11-29,"The Bank of Canada Museum is inviting Canadians of all ages to visit the new exhibition A Noteworthy Woman, which depicts the life of Viola Desmond, an icon of the human rights and social justice movement in Canada and the first Canadian woman to appear on a regular bank note. The exhibition opens to the public on November 30 and will feature rare and never-before-displayed artifacts from Viola Desmond’s life. The exhibition also explores the imagery on the newly circulating $10 bank note.
“Soon, many Canadians will carry a Viola Desmond note with them in their wallets. But the lessons of her life must continue to be told,” said Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn A. Wilkins at an event marking the launch of the new exhibition. “That’s why I’m glad that, through this exhibition, people will be able to learn more about her history, and Canada’s history.”
Desmond, a successful black Nova Scotia businesswoman, defiantly refused to leave a whites-only area of a movie theatre in 1946 and was subsequently jailed, convicted and fined. Her case is one of the first known legal challenges against racial segregation brought forth by a black woman in Canada. Highlights of the exhibition include the following:
""The new banknote featuring Viola Desmond recognizes the impact of this trailblazing woman, whose strength, courage and conviction in the face of racism brought her to the forefront of equal rights in Canada,"" said Minister of Status of Women Maryam Monsef. ""This bill, and the Canadian Museum of Human Rights which is featured on its back, ensures we keep these stories top of mind. We will always stand up for human rights at home and abroad, and on behalf of our government, I am proud to open this important exhibition that shares the story behind the design of the note, and the choice of Viola Desmond for this well-deserved honour.""
Museum visitors will have the opportunity to buy new vertical $10 bank notes featuring Viola Desmond on December 1 and 2. The exhibition will run until May 12, 2019."
Bank of Canada announces finalists for the fourth annual Governor’s Challenge,2018-11-26,"The Bank of Canada today announced the five finalist teams in the 2018–19 edition of The Governor’s Challenge, a competition where university students simulate the role of advisor to the Bank’s Governing Council.
Congratulations to:
With special mention to the runner-up teams:
Governor Stephen S. Poloz thanked all the students for participating and the professors for coaching their teams through to this stage. “I see the students competing in the Governor’s Challenge as among those who could shape the future of economics and finance,” he said. “With the skills they develop—analysis, ingenuity and imagination—and inspiration from their teachers, I look forward to seeing what they do next.”"
Bank of Canada launches digital hub for promoting a stable and efficient financial system,2018-11-14,"Today the Bank of Canada launched the Financial System Hub, a dedicated space on the Bank’s website for timely analysis and research on financial stability issues. The digital format gives the Bank flexibility to discuss new financial system developments as they arise and present its work in more accessible and engaging ways. In addition to regular publication of analysis and research, the Hub will include shorter posts, visuals and multimedia content.
A digital edition of the June 2018 Financial System Review and some posts that explain key financial system concepts in simple terms accompany three new items published for the first time today on the Hub:
Also accessible through the Hub is the new Financial System Research Centre, which showcases the Bank’s deeper research into financial system topics and encourages partnerships with external researchers.
With current analysis posted regularly, interested readers can subscribe to our email alerts for instant updates.
Speaking to journalists ahead of the launch, Senior Deputy Governor of Carolyn A. Wilkins made the following remarks:
“The launch of the Hub is a step forward to increasing the transparency and timeliness of our research and analysis of the Canadian financial system, and it gives this core function of the Bank’s mandate the greater visibility it deserves.”
“The changes to mortgage lending guidelines are driving a steady improvement in the quality of new loans, while the quantity has decreased. We believe both higher mortgage interest rates and stricter mortgage criteria are playing a role.”
“This scenario analysis shows the financial system remains highly resilient to a house price correction centered in our two largest markets.”"
Bank of Canada publishes staff economic projections for the first time,2018-11-01,"Today the Bank of Canada launched a digital database with more than 30 years of past staff economic projections of the Canadian economy. These projections serve as a key starting point for Governing Council’s quarterly Monetary Policy Report (MPR) forecasts and their policy interest rate decisions.
“By making this data available, the Bank is taking another step in its open data and transparency efforts, and providing an important source of information for researchers,” said Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn A. Wilkins.
Each quarter, our staff conduct an in-depth analysis of the Canadian and international economies and present it to Governing Council. The projections combine real-time data and forecasts for key macroeconomic indicators, such as real GDP and its components, consumer price inflation, the output gap, the unemployment rate and the implied policy rate path running through the staff projection. Governing Council take these projections, apply their own judgment and adjust them, and ultimately develop their own consensus forecast for the Canadian and global economies, as depicted in the MPR.
The series in this database are published with a five-year lag, with annual updates to follow. The date range available as of today covers some important economic milestones, including the Bank’s move to inﬂation targeting in 1991 and several severe recessions. To learn more about the staff economic projections data, read the staff working paper.
Ms. Wilkins made this announcement at the Bank’s Annual Economic Conference, which brings together academics, policy-makers, private sector economists and representatives from policy think tanks. This year’s theme is inflation targeting and select sessions will be webcast on the Bank’s website this afternoon."
Bank of Canada increases overnight rate target to 1 ¾ per cent,2018-10-24,"The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 1 ¾ per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1 ½ per cent.
The global economic outlook remains solid. The US economy is especially robust and is expected to moderate over the projection horizon, as forecast in the Bank’s July Monetary Policy Report (MPR). The new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will reduce trade policy uncertainty in North America, which has been an important curb on business confidence and investment. However, trade conflict, particularly between the United States and China, is weighing on global growth and commodity prices. Financial market volatility has resurfaced and some emerging markets are under stress but, overall, global financial conditions remain accommodative.
The Canadian economy continues to operate close to its potential and the composition of growth is more balanced. Despite some quarterly fluctuations, growth is expected to average about 2 per cent over the second half of 2018. Real GDP is projected to grow by 2.1 per cent this year and next before slowing to 1.9 per cent in 2020.
The projections for business investment and exports have been revised up, reflecting the USMCA and the recently-approved liquid natural gas project in British Columbia. Still, investment and exports will be dampened by the recent decline in commodity prices, as well as ongoing competitiveness challenges and limited transportation capacity. The Bank will be monitoring the extent to which the USMCA leads to more confidence and business investment in Canada.
Household spending is expected to continue growing at a healthy pace, underpinned by solid employment income growth. Households are adjusting their spending as expected in response to higher interest rates and housing market policies. In this context, household credit growth continues to moderate and housing activity across Canada is stabilizing. As a result, household vulnerabilities are edging lower in a number of respects, although they remain elevated.  
CPI inflation dropped to 2.2 per cent in September, in large part because the summer spike in airfares was reversed. Other temporary factors pushing up inflation, such as past increases in gasoline prices and minimum wages, should fade in early 2019. Inflation is then expected to remain close to the 2 per cent target through the end of 2020. The Bank’s core measures of inflation all remain around 2 per cent, consistent with an economy that is operating at capacity. Wage growth remains moderate, although it is projected to pick up in the coming quarters, consistent with the Bank’s latest Business Outlook Survey.
Given all of these factors, Governing Council agrees that the policy interest rate will need to rise to a neutral stance to achieve the inflation target. In determining the appropriate pace of rate increases, Governing Council will continue to take into account how the economy is adjusting to higher interest rates, given the elevated level of household debt. In addition, we will pay close attention to global trade policy developments and their implications for the inflation outlook.   
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is December 5, 2018. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on January 9, 2019."
Bank of Canada launches new program to foster collaboration with innovators,2018-10-10,"The Bank of Canada is looking for partners in the private sector and academia to experiment with digital tools and technology, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. The Partnerships in Innovation and Technology (PIVOT) program is part of the Bank’s efforts to fast-track innovation in its economic analysis and research, as well as in its day-to-day operations.
This new program builds on a commitment in the Bank’s Medium-Term Plan to deepen its knowledge of leading-edge technologies and its engagement with innovators in Canada and globally. It complements the Bank’s other innovation initiatives, including its partnership with the Creative Destruction Lab.
“We’re always working to enhance our economic and financial analysis and operations. Teaming up with entrepreneurs and experts to explore new technology is a great way to do that,” said Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn A. Wilkins. “The PIVOT program will help us remain innovative in our mission to promote the economic and financial welfare of Canadians.”
By working with external partners on short-term experiments, PIVOT aims to identify and solve unique business challenges that may not have a readily available commercial solution. It will also allow Bank staff to keep pace with emerging technologies and their applications, and broaden relationships with the innovation and technology communities.
The following challenges are open for applications:
The Bank will periodically issue additional challenges. Innovators and entrepreneurs can subscribe for instant updates. Details on how to apply are available on the Bank’s website."
Bank of Canada partners with Canadian Foundation for Economic Education to launch new website,2018-10-04,"Today, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen S. Poloz welcomed students and teachers to the Bank of Canada Museum for the launch of Money and Monetary Policy in Canada. This online resource for educators was authored by the Canadian Foundation for Economic Education (CFEE) in close collaboration with Bank staff. Using simple language and relatable examples, it explains topics such as the use and history of money, how the financial system works, the role of the central bank, and how interest rates are set.
“This is another important investment the Bank has made to encourage economic education in Canada,” Governor Poloz said. “As with last week’s launch of The Economy, Plain and Simple, we hope this resource will make economics more accessible and meaningful to students, educators and the general public.”
The new website is structured in a modular format so that educators can select the topics that fit best with their curriculum and course work. The content is bilingual, and teachers’ guides accompany each module.
Beginning in 2019, the Bank of Canada Museum will deliver educational programs for elementary and secondary school students to complement the tours already provided as part of school visits. This work has greatly benefited from the Bank’s long-standing relationship with CFEE.   
“It is an honour to partner with the Bank on a resource that will help Canadians—especially youth—be better prepared for the economic challenges and opportunities they will encounter in life,” said Gary Rabbior, President of CFEE. “Our organization believes good economic policy benefits from Canadians understanding the rationale for policy decisions, recognizing appropriate policy measures once taken and—through their own actions—enabling good policy to run its course.”
A previous printed edition of Money and Monetary Policy in Canada is currently used in high schools and post-secondary institutions. The materials on www.moneyandmonetarypolicyincanada.com are free."
"Bank of Canada launches The Economy, Plain and Simple",2018-09-28,"Today, the Bank of Canada launched a new digital publication to help Canadians better understand the economy. The Economy, Plain and Simple will feature regular blog-like educational articles about current economic issues, using plain language and engaging visuals to explain concepts in simple terms. It will also cover topics related to the Bank of Canada’s main functions.
“This initiative is the latest of many important steps the Bank has taken to communicate more clearly with Canadians,” said Governor Stephen S. Poloz. “Along with our outstanding Museum and website, the new publication helps Canadians better understand the economy and the Bank’s role. Ultimately, this understanding helps people make more-informed financial decisions and makes our own policies more effective.”

Bank of Canada calls for nominations for the 2019 Fellowship Program awards,2018-09-10,"The Bank of Canada is inviting Canadian universities to nominate exceptional academics for its 2019 Fellowship and Governor’s awards. Presented annually, these awards distinguish and support the work of academics who are making exemplary contributions to economic and financial research in Canada.
Because issues related to central banking extend beyond traditional monetary policy theory, the Fellowship Program is designed to foster research excellence in a broad range of fields related to the Bank’s core functions: monetary policy, financial system, currency and funds management. The program also supports collaboration between Bank staff and leading academics at Canadian post-secondary institutions.
There are two types of awards under the Fellowship Program:
The deadline for nominations is Friday, November 9, 2018. For more information on the Program, award requirements and the nomination process, please visit the Bank’s website. A list of past recipients is available here."
Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1 ½ per cent,2018-09-05,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1 ½ per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 ¾ per cent and the deposit rate is 1 ¼ per cent.
CPI inflation moved up to 3 per cent in July. This was higher than expected, in large part because of a jump in the airfare component of the consumer price index. The Bank expects CPI inflation to move back towards 2 per cent in early 2019, as the effects of past increases in gasoline prices dissipate. The Bank’s core measures of inflation remain firmly around 2 per cent, consistent with an economy that has been operating near capacity for some time. Wage growth remains moderate.     
Recent data on the global economy have been consistent with the Bank’s July Monetary Policy Report (MPR) projections. The US economy is particularly robust, with strong consumer spending and business investment. Elevated trade tensions remain a key risk to the global outlook and are pulling some commodity prices lower. Meanwhile, financial stresses have intensified in certain emerging market economies, but with limited spillovers to other countries.
The Canadian economy is evolving closely in line with the Bank’s July projection for growth to average near potential. Following growth of 1.4 per cent in the first quarter, GDP rebounded by 2.9 per cent in the second quarter, as the Bank had forecast. GDP growth is expected to slow temporarily in the third quarter, mainly because of further fluctuations in energy production and exports.
While uncertainty about trade policies continues to weigh on businesses, the rotation of demand towards business investment and exports is proceeding. Despite choppiness in the data, both business investment and exports have been growing solidly for several quarters. Meanwhile, activity in the housing market is beginning to stabilize as households adjust to higher interest rates and changes in housing policies. Continuing gains in employment and labour income are helping to support consumption. As past interest rate increases work their way through the economy, credit growth has moderated and the household debt-to-income ratio is beginning to edge down.
Recent data reinforce Governing Council’s assessment that higher interest rates will be warranted to achieve the inflation target. We will continue to take a gradual approach, guided by incoming data. In particular, the Bank continues to gauge the economy’s reaction to higher interest rates. The Bank is also monitoring closely the course of NAFTA negotiations and other trade policy developments, and their impact on the inflation outlook.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is October 24, 2018. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."
"Bank of Canada publishes its 2019 schedule for policy interest rate announcements, the release of the Monetary Policy Report, the Business Outlook Survey and the Senior Loan Officer Survey",2018-07-31,"The Bank of Canada today published its 2019 schedule for policy interest rate announcements and the release of the quarterly Monetary Policy Report, and reconfirmed the scheduled interest rate announcement dates for the remainder of this year.
It also published its schedule for the release of the Winter through Fall issues of the Business Outlook Survey and the Senior Loan Officer Survey.

All survey releases will take place at 10:30 (ET). The Business Outlook Survey and the Senior Loan Officer Survey are released concurrently."
Bank of Canada raises overnight rate target to 1 ½ per cent,2018-07-11,"The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 1 ½ per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 ¾ per cent and the deposit rate is 1 ¼ per cent.
The Bank expects the global economy to grow by about 3 ¾ per cent in 2018 and 3 ½ per cent in 2019, in line with the April Monetary Policy Report (MPR). The US economy is proving stronger than expected, reinforcing market expectations of higher policy rates and pushing up the US dollar. This is contributing to financial stresses in some emerging market economies. Meanwhile, oil prices have risen. Yet, the Canadian dollar is lower, reflecting broad-based US dollar strength and concerns about trade actions. The possibility of more trade protectionism is the most important threat to global prospects.
Canada’s economy continues to operate close to its capacity and the composition of growth is shifting. Temporary factors are causing volatility in quarterly growth rates: the Bank projects a pick-up to 2.8 per cent in the second quarter and a moderation to 1.5 per cent in the third. Household spending is being dampened by higher interest rates and tighter mortgage lending guidelines. Recent data suggest housing markets are beginning to stabilize following a weak start to 2018. Meanwhile, exports are being buoyed by strong global demand and higher commodity prices. Business investment is growing in response to solid demand growth and capacity pressures, although trade tensions are weighing on investment in some sectors. Overall, the Bank still expects average growth of close to 2 per cent over 2018-2020.
CPI and the Bank’s core measures of inflation remain near 2 per cent, consistent with an economy operating close to capacity. CPI inflation is expected to edge up further to about 2.5 per cent before settling back to 2 per cent by the second half of 2019. The Bank estimates that underlying wage growth is running at about 2.3 per cent, slower than would be expected in a labour market with no slack.
As in April, the projection incorporates an estimate of the impact of trade uncertainty on Canadian investment and exports. This effect is now judged to be larger, given mounting trade tensions.
The July projection also incorporates the estimated impact of tariffs on steel and aluminum recently imposed by the United States, as well as the countermeasures enacted by Canada. Although there will be difficult adjustments for some industries and their workers, the effect of these measures on Canadian growth and inflation is expected to be modest.
Governing Council expects that higher interest rates will be warranted to keep inflation near target and will continue to take a gradual approach, guided by incoming data. In particular, the Bank is monitoring the economy’s adjustment to higher interest rates and the evolution of capacity and wage pressures, as well as the response of companies and consumers to trade actions. 
 The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is September 5, 2018. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on October 24, 2018."
Bank of Canada partners with Creative Destruction Lab to deepen knowledge of new technologies,2018-06-13,"The Bank of Canada announced today that it will partner with the Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) to deepen its knowledge of leading technologies.
This partnership is motivated by the Bank’s 2019–21 Medium-Term Plan, which focuses on better understanding the digital economy and the technological transformation of financial services and on strengthening innovation in its own operations as a central bank.
In particular, the Bank’s partnership agreement with CDL will enable it to stay abreast of developments in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, crypto-asset technologies and quantum computing. The Bank of Canada will be an AI Stream partner and participate in both the CDL-Toronto and CDL-Montreal programs for a three-year period. The partnership will allow Bank staff to better understand these technologies and their applications. In addition, the Bank plans to leverage the CDL program by inviting participating experts to share their knowledge with staff.
“The Bank is delighted to collaborate with the world-class experts at CDL as part of our digital economy agenda,” said Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins. “This partnership aligns perfectly with our core goals of leveraging technology to enhance the quality and breadth of our research and analysis and increasing the efficiency of the Bank’s operations.”
“While a collaboration between a central bank and a high-tech university start-up program may seem counterintuitive, we are convinced that the skills and assets each of us bring will result in a highly productive partnership that will enhance Canadian competitiveness,” says Sonia Sennik, Executive Director of the CDL.
The Creative Destruction Lab is a seed-stage program for massively scalable, science-based companies that works with world-class entrepreneurs, scientists and investors as well as university students to bring the best ideas in the technology field to market. Launched in 2012 in Toronto at the Rotman School of Management, the CDL program has since expanded to Vancouver, Calgary, Montréal, Halifax and New York City. The nine-month program employs an objectives-based mentoring process with the goal of maximizing equity-value creation. The CDL is particularly suited to early-stage companies with links to university research labs."
Deputy Governor Sylvain Leduc to leave the Bank of Canada,2018-06-13,"The Bank of Canada announced today that Deputy Governor Sylvain Leduc will leave the Bank in late July 2018. Mr. Leduc will return to San Francisco with his family to resume working at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
Mr. Leduc was appointed Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada in May 2016 and has been one of two deputy governors responsible for overseeing the Bank’s analysis and activities in promoting a stable and efficient financial system. Before his appointment to the Bank of Canada, Mr. Leduc served as Vice President, Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Research at the San Francisco Fed—a position he had held since 2013.
Governor Stephen S. Poloz thanked Mr. Leduc for his important contribution to the Bank’s policy and its research during his time at the Bank of Canada.
“Sylvain has been a wonderful addition to Governing Council. We have benefitted from his policy expertise and his strong sense of teamwork,” Governor Poloz said, “Sylvain’s motivation and leadership has had a powerful impact on our researchers and on the Bank’s capacity as a research institution. While we are sorry to say good-bye to this brilliant Canadian, we wish him every success in his future career in central banking.”
The process to appoint a new Deputy Governor will begin immediately. The Board of Directors will form a selection committee to conduct the search and selection process, with the assistance of global executive recruiting firm Boyden. Public advertisements for the Deputy Governor position will be published on the Bank's web site, as well as in major media outlets."
Canada’s financial system remains resilient as vulnerabilities show further signs of easing,2018-06-07,"High household indebtedness and housing market imbalances remain the most important vulnerabilities identified by the Bank of Canada in its Financial System Review (FSR), published today. While these vulnerabilities remain elevated, policy measures continue to improve the resilience of the financial system.
The vulnerability related to high household indebtedness has begun to ease. Incomes continue to rise and household credit growth has slowed due to higher interest rates and policy measures aimed at mortgage financing and housing. Because of the sheer size of the stock of debt, however, this vulnerability will persist for some time.
House price growth has also slowed, led by a decline in the Greater Toronto Area. The condominium markets in the Toronto and Vancouver areas remain strong, with some evidence of speculative activity. Overall, the vulnerability associated with housing market imbalances has shown signs of lessening but remains elevated.
“The two main vulnerabilities we have been watching closely are showing continued signs of easing, which is encouraging,” said Governor Stephen S. Poloz. “Combined, the impact of higher interest rates and the changes to the mortgage guidelines have reduced credit growth and improved the quality of new lending.”
The third main vulnerability highlighted in the FSR concerns cyber threats to an interconnected financial system. The Bank has been working with the major banks and Payments Canada to ensure Canada’s key payment systems are able to recover quickly should a cyber attack be successful. “Continued collaboration and a greater pooling of resources are needed to increase the overall resilience of the financial system,” said the Governor.
The key risk scenarios that apply to these vulnerabilities are similar to those in the November 2017 FSR, as is the level of risk that any of these scenarios might materialize. The most important risk is a severe nationwide recession leading to a rise in financial stress. Other key risks are a house price correction in overheated markets and a sharp increase in long-term interest rates driven by higher global risk premiums.
The Bank is also modernizing the way it communicates and engages with Canadians on financial stability issues. “This autumn, we will launch a new financial system hub on our website, where we will publish timely and accessible research and analysis throughout the year,” said Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn A. Wilkins. As well, a member of Governing Council will deliver a speech each autumn to provide an update on the Bank’s assessment of the vulnerabilities and risks to the financial system. The FSR will now be published once a year, in June, and the quarterly Monetary Policy Report will include more in-depth discussion of relevant financial system issues, as warranted.
This issue of the FSR also features three reports written by Bank of Canada staff:"
Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1¼ per cent,2018-05-30,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1¼ per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1½ per cent and the deposit rate is 1 per cent.
Global economic activity remains broadly on track with the Bank’s April Monetary Policy Report (MPR) forecast. Recent data point to some upside to the outlook for the US economy. At the same time, ongoing uncertainty about trade policies is dampening global business investment and stresses are developing in some emerging market economies. Global oil prices have been higher than assumed in April, in part reflecting geopolitical developments.
Inflation in Canada has been close to the 2 per cent target and will likely be a bit higher in the near term than forecast in April, largely because of recent increases in gasoline prices. Core measures of inflation remain near 2 per cent, consistent with an economy operating close to potential. As usual, the Bank will look through the transitory impact of fluctuations in gasoline prices.
In Canada, economic data since the April MPR have, on balance, supported the Bank’s outlook for growth around 2 per cent in the first half of 2018. Activity in the first quarter appears to have been a little stronger than projected.  Exports of goods were more robust than forecast, and data on imports of machinery and equipment suggest continued recovery in investment. Housing resale activity has remained soft into the second quarter, as the housing market continues to adjust to new mortgage guidelines and higher borrowing rates. Going forward, solid labour income growth supports the expectation that housing activity will pick up and consumption will continue to contribute importantly to growth in 2018.
Overall, developments since April further reinforce Governing Council’s view that higher interest rates will be warranted to keep inflation near target. Governing Council will take a gradual approach to policy adjustments, guided by incoming data. In particular, the Bank will continue to assess the economy’s sensitivity to interest rate movements and the evolution of economic capacity.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is July 11, 2018. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."
Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1 ¼ per cent,2018-04-18,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1 ¼ per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 ½ per cent and the deposit rate is 1 per cent.
Inflation in Canada is close to 2 per cent as temporary factors that have been weighing on inflation have largely dissipated, as expected. Consistent with an economy operating with little slack, core measures of inflation have continued to edge up and are all now close to 2 per cent. The transitory impact of higher gasoline prices and recent minimum wage increases will likely cause inflation in 2018 to be modestly higher than the Bank expected in its January Monetary Policy Report (MPR), returning to the 2 per cent target for the rest of the projection horizon.
The global economy is on a modestly stronger track than forecast in January, with upward revisions to growth and potential output in a number of major advanced economies. The outlook for the U.S. economy has been further boosted by new government spending plans. However, escalating geopolitical and trade conflicts risk undermining the global expansion.
In Canada, GDP growth in the first quarter was weaker than the Bank had expected, but should rebound in the second quarter, resulting in 2 per cent average growth in the first half of 2018. The economy is projected to operate slightly above its potential over the next three years, with real GDP growth of about 2 per cent in both 2018 and 2019, and 1.8 per cent in 2020. This stronger profile for GDP incorporates new provincial and federal fiscal measures announced since January. It also reflects upward revisions to estimates of potential output growth, which suggest the Canadian economy has made some progress in building capacity.
Slower economic growth in the first quarter primarily reflects weakness in two areas. Housing markets responded to new mortgage guidelines and other policy measures by pulling forward transactions to late 2017. Exports also faltered, partly owing to transportation bottlenecks. Some of the weakness in housing and exports is expected to be unwound as 2018 progresses.
The Bank anticipates that Canadian exports will strengthen as foreign demand increases, but not sufficiently to recover the ground lost during recent quarters. Export growth is being increasingly limited by capacity constraints in some sectors. Continued gains in business investment should build additional capacity in those sectors and in the economy more generally. However, both exports and investment are being held back by ongoing competitiveness challenges and uncertainty about trade policies.
Growth in consumption remains robust, supported by strong labour income growth. Wages have continued to pick up as expected, even after factoring out recent minimum wage increases in Ontario and Alberta. The Bank will continue to assess labour market data for signs of remaining slack.
Some progress has been made on the key issues being watched closely by Governing Council, particularly the dynamics of inflation and wage growth. This progress reinforces Governing Council’s view that higher interest rates will be warranted over time, although some monetary policy accommodation will still be needed to keep inflation on target. The Bank will also continue to monitor the economy’s sensitivity to interest rate movements and the evolution of economic capacity. In this context, Governing Council will remain cautious with respect to future policy adjustments, guided by incoming data.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is May 30, 2018. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on July 11, 2018."
The Bank of Canada releases its Annual Report for 2017,2018-03-26,"The Bank of Canada’s Annual Report for 2017 was tabled in the House of Commons today. The Report will be available at 12:00 (ET) on the Bank’s website.

Bank of Canada announces recipients of  2018 Fellowship and Governor’s awards,2018-03-23,"The Bank of Canada is pleased to announce that Stephen D. Williamson of Western University and Peter F. Christoffersen of the University of Toronto are the 2018 recipients of the Bank’s Fellowship Award.
Professor Williamson is an expert in macroeconomics and monetary policy. He holds Western’s Stephen A. Jarislowsky Chair in Central Banking, which aims to support work in the area of monetary policy. His most recent research is focused on better understanding conventional and unconventional monetary policy, how monetary policy should be conducted in a low interest rate environment and re-examining the relationship between monetary and fiscal policy.
“The Bank of Canada is proud to recognize Professor Stephen D. Williamson, this year’s Fellowship Award recipient, for his outstanding contributions to research in all four of the Bank’s core functions,” said Governor Stephen S. Poloz. “His work is helping to expand knowledge in these fields. Moreover, his commitment to mentoring students and emerging researchers is fostering a new generation of thought leaders in central banking—not just in Canada, but around the world.”
In addition to this year’s new fellow, the Bank announced the renewal of the fellowship awarded in 2013 to Peter F. Christoffersen, Professor of Finance at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. Professor Christoffersen’s research examines the impact and potential applications of new technologies, such as machine learning and big data, in the financial industry.
“The Bank is pleased to renew its support for Professor Christoffersen’s work, which is highly relevant to our own research agenda in digitalization. He is helping to shed light on some of the most important issues facing Canada’s financial industry,"" said Governor Poloz.
The Bank also announced that Markus Poschke, Associate Professor and William Dawson Scholar at McGill University, was selected as the recipient of this year’s Governor’s Award. Professor Poschke is an increasingly prominent member of the Canadian economics community. His research, which focuses on inequality and economic growth, has been published in some of the top journals in macroeconomics.
“Rising inequality and stagnant growth in many advanced economies have proven to be some of the key challenges of our times,” said Governor Poloz. “We are proud to support Professor Poschke’s work, which combines frontier methods in macroeconomics and new approaches for analyzing microeconomic data, to better understand the root causes of these challenges and the effects of public policies.”
Key facts:"
Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1 1/4 per cent,2018-03-07,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1 per cent.
Global growth remains solid and broad-based. In the United States, new government spending and previously-announced tax cuts are anticipated to boost growth in 2018 and 2019. However, trade policy developments are an important and growing source of uncertainty for the global and Canadian outlooks.
In Canada, the national accounts data show that the economy grew by 3 per cent in 2017, bringing the level of real GDP in line with the projection in the Bank’s January Monetary Policy Report (MPR). In the fourth quarter, GDP growth was slower than expected, largely due to higher imports, while exports made only a partial recovery from their third-quarter decline. The gain in imports mainly reflected stronger business investment, which adds to the economy’s capacity.
Strong housing data in late 2017, and softer data at the beginning of this year, indicate some pulling forward of demand ahead of new mortgage guidelines and other policy measures. It will take some time to fully assess the impact of these, as well as recently announced provincial measures, on housing demand and prices. More broadly, the Bank continues to monitor the economy’s sensitivity to higher interest rates. Notably, household credit growth has decelerated for three consecutive months. The implications of the recent federal budget for the outlook for growth and inflation will be incorporated in the Bank’s April projection.
Inflation is running close to the 2 per cent target and the Bank’s core measures of inflation have edged up, consistent with an economy operating near capacity. Wage growth has firmed, but remains lower than would be typical in an economy with no labour market slack. Inflation is fluctuating because of temporary factors related to gasoline, electricity, and minimum wages.
In this context, Governing Council maintained the target for the overnight rate at 1 1/4 per cent. While the economic outlook is expected to warrant higher interest rates over time, some continued monetary policy accommodation will likely be needed to keep the economy operating close to potential and inflation on target. Governing Council will remain cautious in considering future policy adjustments, guided by incoming data in assessing the economy’s sensitivity to interest rates, the evolution of economic capacity, and the dynamics of both wage growth and inflation.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is April 18, 2018. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."
Inaugural recipients of Master’s Scholarship Award for Women  in Economics and Finance announced,2018-03-05,"The Bank of Canada is pleased to announce the first ever recipients of its Master’s Scholarship Award for Women in Economics and Finance. This award, announced in September 2017, is designed to attract and advance women in the core areas of the Bank’s work, where they are under-represented. A $10,000 scholarship is combined with an offer of permanent employment at the Bank upon successful completion of a master’s degree by a recipient.
The three successful applicants in 2017–18 are as follows:
“It is with great pleasure that I congratulate these outstanding women,” said Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn A. Wilkins. “Having a diverse work place and advancing more talented women in the fields of economics and finance is a priority for the Bank of Canada. We hope that our scholarship programs will continue to encourage more people from many different backgrounds and perspectives to consider these careers and to work with us.”"
Background information on the  bank note legal tender initiative in Budget 2018,2018-02-27,"The Bank of Canada today published additional information on the federal government’s 2018 budget initiative to seek the authority to remove legal tender status from Canadian bank notes.
Having the authority to remove legal tender status from bank notes would match the authority the government currently has for coins issued by the Royal Canadian Mint. The Bank of Canada supports this initiative because it can help the Bank ensure that bank notes used by Canadians are current, in good condition, easy to use and difficult to counterfeit. 
As stated in Budget 2018, if this power is granted by Parliament, the government’s intention is to remove legal tender status from the $1, $2, $25, $500 and $1,000 bank notes. Removing legal tender status from these older notes is expected to have little impact on most Canadians, as these denominations have not been produced in decades and are rarely used in transactions. Importantly, removal of legal tender status does not mean these notes will lose their face value; the Bank of Canada will continue to honour them.
If the government is granted this power, the Bank of Canada will provide clear information to Canadians on how to redeem the affected bank notes. This will involve a period during which the notes can be redeemed through financial institutions—as Canadians can do today. After this period, the notes can be redeemed directly through the Bank of Canada.
There are currently no plans to remove legal tender status from any other bank notes."
Wilfrid Laurier University crowned National Champion of The Governor’s Challenge,2018-02-12,"Wilfrid Laurier University has won the Bank of Canada’s third annual Governor’s Challenge, a national student competition in which teams simulate the role of advisor to the Bank’s Governing Council. The winners were announced following the final round in Ottawa on Saturday, February 10.
Governor Stephen S. Poloz, who watched the final round of presentations and awarded the championship trophy, congratulated Laurier and encouraged all participants to keep up their interest in the monetary policy-making process. “The economic analysis, understanding of monetary policy and appreciation of the Canadian economy demonstrated by these young people are highly relevant to the work we do at the Bank of Canada,” he said. “I hope they consider a career in central banking as they pursue their education and professional goals.”
Five teams competed in the final round, each one giving a presentation on the economic outlook for Canada and making a monetary policy recommendation to a panel of senior executives from the Bank and the private sector.
“Monetary policy in Canada is made by consensus and I was particularly impressed by the evidence of strong teamwork across all five teams,” said Deputy Governor Sylvain Leduc, who judged the final round alongside Jing Yang, Deputy Managing Director of the Bank’s Canadian Economic Analysis Department, and Martin Eichenbaum, Professor of Economics at Northwestern University and Co-Director of the Center for International Macroeconomics.

Bank of Canada increases overnight rate target to 1 1/4 per cent,2018-01-17,"The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 1 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1 per cent. Recent data have been strong, inflation is close to target, and the economy is operating roughly at capacity. However, uncertainty surrounding the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is clouding the economic outlook.
The global economy continues to strengthen, with growth expected to average 3 1/2 per cent over the projection horizon. Growth in advanced economies is projected to be stronger than in the Bank’s October Monetary Policy Report (MPR). In particular, there are signs of increasing momentum in the US economy, which will be boosted further by recent tax changes. Global commodity prices are higher, although the benefits to Canada are being diluted by wider spreads between benchmark world and Canadian oil prices.
In Canada, real GDP growth is expected to slow to 2.2 per cent in 2018 and 1.6 per cent in 2019, following an estimated 3.0 per cent in 2017. Growth is expected to remain above potential through the first quarter of 2018 and then slow to a rate close to potential for the rest of the projection horizon.
Consumption and residential investment have been stronger than anticipated, reflecting strong employment growth. Business investment has been increasing at a solid pace, and investment intentions remain positive. Exports have been weaker than expected although, apart from cross-border shifts in automotive production, there have been positive signs in most other categories.
Looking forward, consumption and residential investment are expected to contribute less to growth, given higher interest rates and new mortgage guidelines, while business investment and exports are expected to contribute more. The Bank’s outlook takes into account a small benefit to Canada’s economy from stronger US demand arising from recent tax changes. However, as uncertainty about the future of NAFTA is weighing increasingly on the outlook, the Bank has incorporated into its projection additional negative judgement on business investment and trade.
The Bank continues to monitor the extent to which strong demand is boosting potential, creating room for more non-inflationary expansion. In this respect, capital investment, firm creation, labour force participation, and hours worked are all showing promising signs. Recent data show that labour market slack is being absorbed more quickly than anticipated. Wages have picked up but are rising by less than would be typical in the absence of labour market slack.
In this context, inflation is close to 2 per cent and core measures of inflation have edged up, consistent with diminishing slack in the economy. The Bank expects CPI inflation to fluctuate in the months ahead as various temporary factors (including gasoline and electricity prices) unwind. Looking through these temporary factors, inflation is expected to remain close to 2 per cent over the projection horizon.
While the economic outlook is expected to warrant higher interest rates over time, some continued monetary policy accommodation will likely be needed to keep the economy operating close to potential and inflation on target. Governing Council will remain cautious in considering future policy adjustments, guided by incoming data in assessing the economy’s sensitivity to interest rates, the evolution of economic capacity, and the dynamics of both wage growth and inflation.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is March 7, 2018. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on April 18, 2018."

Notes for editors:"
Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1 per cent,2010-10-19,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent.
The global economic recovery is entering a new phase. In advanced economies, temporary factors supporting growth in 2010 - such as the inventory cycle and pent-up demand - have largely run their course and fiscal stimulus will shift to fiscal consolidation over the projection horizon. While the Bank expects that private demand in advanced economies will become sufficiently entrenched to sustain the recovery, the combination of difficult labour market dynamics and ongoing deleveraging in many advanced economies is expected to moderate the pace of growth relative to prior expectations. These factors will contribute to a weaker-than-projected recovery in the United States in particular. Growth in emerging-market economies is expected to ease to a more sustainable pace as fiscal and monetary policies are tightened. Heightened tensions in currency markets and related risks associated with global imbalances could result in a more protracted and difficult global recovery.
The economic outlook for Canada has changed. The Bank expects the economic recovery to be more gradual than it had projected in its July Monetary Policy Report, with growth of 3.0 per cent in 2010, 2.3 per cent in 2011, and 2.6 per cent in 2012. This more modest growth profile reflects a more gradual global recovery and a more subdued profile for household spending. With housing activity declining markedly as anticipated and household debt considerations becoming more important, the Bank expects household expenditures to decelerate to a pace closer to the rate of income growth over the projection horizon. Overall, the composition of demand in Canada is expected to shift away from government and household expenditures towards business investment and net exports. The strength of net exports will be sensitive to currency movements, the expected recovery in productivity growth, and the prospects for external demand.
Inflation in Canada has been slightly below the Bank’s July projection. The recent moderation in core inflation is consistent with the persistence of significant excess supply and a deceleration in the growth of unit labour costs. The Bank judges that the output gap is slightly larger and that the economy will return to full capacity by the end of 2012 rather than the beginning of that year, as had been anticipated in July. The inflation outlook has been revised down and both total CPI and core inflation are now expected to converge to 2 per cent by the end of 2012, as excess supply in the economy is gradually absorbed and inflation expectations remain well-anchored.
Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. This leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in an environment of significant excess supply in Canada.
At this time of transition in the global recovery, with a weaker U.S. outlook, constraints beginning to moderate growth in emerging-market economies, and domestic considerations that are expected to slow consumption and housing activity in Canada, any further reduction in monetary policy stimulus would need to be carefully considered.
A full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on 20 October 2010. The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 7 December 2010."

Notes for editors:"
"Vulnerabilities in the Canadian financial system remain elevated, but elements for improvement are emerging",2017-11-28,"The high level of household indebtedness and housing market imbalances remain the most important vulnerabilities identified by the Bank of Canada in its Financial System Review (FSR), published today. While these vulnerabilities are still elevated, improving economic conditions and recent changes to housing policy should support an easing of these vulnerabilities over time.
“Our financial system continues to be resilient, and is being bolstered by stronger growth and job creation, but we need to continue to watch financial vulnerabilities closely,” said Governor Stephen S. Poloz.
While household debt relative to income continues to rise, there have been notable shifts in mortgage activity over the past year, including an improvement in the quality of new high-ratio mortgages (those with a down payment of less than 20 per cent).
At the same time, some indicators suggest increasing risks associated with new low-ratio mortgages, such as a greater proportion of these mortgages being issued to highly indebted households. Recent changes to guidelines for low-ratio mortgages will take effect in January 2018 and are expected to mitigate some of these risks over time.
The Bank of Canada continues to monitor housing market imbalances closely, particularly for signs of extrapolative expectations. In both the Greater Toronto Area and the Greater Vancouver Area, economic fundamentals, combined with limited supply, continue to support house price growth. However, housing policy measures, together with higher mortgage rates, are expected to weigh on housing activity.
A third vulnerability highlighted in the FSR concerns cyber threats and the interconnectedness of the financial system. Through the Bank’s oversight of critical financial market infrastructures, it imposes high standards for risk resilience. In this context, the Bank is working with industry and public sector partners to reinforce the resilience of core payment systems and to ensure that key financial system participants can recover quickly in the event of a cyberattack.
The risk scenarios summarized in this FSR are the same as in June.
The November issue also features two reports written by Bank of Canada staff:"
Bank of Canada and Bank of Korea sign currency swap agreement,2017-11-15,"The Bank of Canada and the Bank of Korea today announced a standing bilateral liquidity swap arrangement, effective immediately. The arrangement allows for the provision of liquidity in each jurisdiction to support domestic financial stability should market conditions warrant. This effectively enables the Bank of Canada to provide Canadian dollars to the Bank of Korea, and to provide liquidity in Korean Won to financial institutions in Canada, should the need arise. Likewise, the Bank of Korea can provide Korean Won to the Bank of Canada, as well as provide liquidity in Canadian dollars to financial institutions in Korea.
Governor Stephen S. Poloz and Governor Juyeol Lee signed the agreement establishing the swap arrangement at a ceremony at the Bank of Canada’s head office in Ottawa, Canada.
This announcement is also available on the Bank of Korea website."
Statement on the Nomination of a New Federal Reserve Chair,2017-11-03,"The Bank of Canada congratulates Jerome Powell on his nomination as the new Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Bank has worked with Mr. Powell in his capacity as a member of the Federal Reserve Board and we look forward to continuing the close working relationship enjoyed by our two institutions.
The Bank has been honoured to work with Chair Janet Yellen. We are grateful for her many years of service to the Board, and her consistent demonstration of leadership, integrity and collaboration among the international policy-making community."
Bank of Canada calls for nominations for the 2018 Fellowship Program awards,2017-09-08,"The Bank of Canada is inviting Canadian universities to nominate exceptional academics for its 2018 Fellowship and Governor’s awards. Presented annually, these awards distinguish and support the work of academics who are making exemplary contributions to economic and financial research in Canada.
Because issues related to central banking extend beyond traditional monetary policy theory, the Fellowship Program is designed to foster research excellence in a broad range of fields related to the Bank’s core functions: monetary policy, financial system, currency and funds management. The program also supports collaboration between Bank staff and leading academics at Canadian post-secondary institutions.
There are two types of awards under the Fellowship Program:

Bank of Canada increases overnight rate target to 1 per cent,2010-09-08,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent.
The global economic recovery is proceeding but remains uneven, balancing strong activity in emerging market economies with weak growth in some advanced economies. In the United States, the recovery in private demand is being held back by high unemployment and recent indicators suggest a more muted recovery in the near term.
Economic activity in Canada was slightly softer in the second quarter than the Bank had expected, although consumption and investment have evolved largely as anticipated.  Going forward, consumption growth is expected to remain solid and business investment to rise strongly. Both are being supported by accommodative credit conditions, which have eased in recent weeks mainly owing to sharp declines in global bond yields.
The Bank now expects the economic recovery in Canada to be slightly more gradual than it had projected in its July Monetary Policy Report (MPR), largely reflecting a weaker profile for U.S. activity. Inflation in Canada has been broadly in line with the Bank's expectations and its dynamics are essentially unchanged.
Against this backdrop, the Bank decided to increase its target for the overnight rate to 1 per cent. As a result of monetary policy measures taken since April, financial conditions in Canada have tightened modestly but remain exceptionally stimulative. This is consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in an environment of significant excess supply in Canada.
Any further reduction in monetary policy stimulus would need to be carefully considered in light of the unusual uncertainty surrounding the outlook.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 19 October 2010. A full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on 20 October 2010."
Bank of Canada publishes its 2018 schedule for policy interest rate announcements and the release of the Monetary Policy Report,2017-07-26,"The Bank of Canada today published its 2018 schedule for policy interest rate announcements and the release of the quarterly Monetary Policy Report. It also reconfirmed the scheduled announcement dates for the remainder of this year.
The scheduled announcement dates from September 2017 through December 2017 are reconfirmed as follows:
The scheduled announcement dates for 2018 are as follows:
*Monetary Policy Report published
All rate announcements will be made at 10:00 (ET), and the Monetary Policy Report will be published concurrently with the January, April, July and October rate announcements."
Bank of Canada increases overnight rate target to 3/4 per cent,2010-07-20,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 3/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/2 per cent.
The global economic recovery is proceeding but is not yet self-sustaining. Greater emphasis on balance sheet repair by households, banks, and governments in a number of advanced economies is expected to temper the pace of global growth relative to the Bank's outlook in its April Monetary Policy Report (MPR). While the policy response to the European sovereign debt crisis has reduced the risk of an adverse outcome and increased the prospect of sustainable long term growth, it is expected to slow the global recovery over the projection horizon. In the United States, private demand is picking up but remains uneven.
Economic activity in Canada is unfolding largely as expected, led by government and consumer spending. Housing activity is declining markedly from high levels, consistent with the Bank's view that policy stimulus resulted in household expenditures being brought forward into late 2009 and early 2010. While employment growth has resumed, business investment appears to be held back by global uncertainties and has yet to recover from its sharp contraction during the recession.
The Bank expects the economic recovery in Canada to be more gradual than it had projected in its April MPR, with growth of 3.5 per cent in 2010, 2.9 per cent in 2011, and 2.2 per cent in 2012. This revision reflects a slightly weaker profile for global economic growth and more modest consumption growth in Canada. The Bank anticipates that business investment and net exports will make a relatively larger contribution to growth.
Inflation in Canada has been broadly in line with the Bank's April projection. While the Bank now expects the economy to return to full capacity at the end of 2011, two quarters later than had been anticipated in April, the underlying dynamics for inflation are little changed. Both total CPI and core inflation are expected to remain near 2 per cent throughout the projection period. The Bank will look through the transitory effects on inflation of changes to provincial indirect taxes.
Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to raise the target for the overnight rate to 3/4 per cent. This decision leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in light of the significant excess supply in Canada, the strength of domestic spending, and the uneven global recovery.
Given the considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook, any further reduction of monetary stimulus would have to be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic developments.
A full update of the Bank's outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on 22 July 2010. The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 8 September 2010."
"Governor Poloz unveils new Bank of Canada Museum ahead of public opening on July 1, 2017",2017-06-20,"Governor Stephen S. Poloz today welcomed special guests from the government, business and the tourism sectors for a preview of the Bank of Canada Museum, which is opening soon. Located at the corner of Bank and Wellington, in the Bank’s head office complex in downtown Ottawa, the re-designed Museum will help visitors learn about the economy and the role of the central bank in fun, interactive ways.
“I am so proud of this new Museum. It immerses Canadians in the economy and the work of the Bank of Canada in ways that people of all ages can understand and enjoy,” Governor Poloz said.
After a four-year closure, and a complete re-imagining, the Museum will open to the public on July 1, with free admission year-round.
To help visitors of all ages understand the important role they play in the economy, they are placed at the centre of the Museum experience. They begin their visit by creating a digital character, or avatar, to represent them in interactive exhibits that demonstrate how their spending and saving habits ultimately contribute to the Canadian economy. Other highlights include a video game that simulates flying a rocket ship through a galaxy of inflationary and deflationary forces and designing a personalized bank note.  
Visitors will also discover Canada’s monetary heritage, as interpreted through a careful selection of 1,400 artifacts from the National Currency Collection. Examples of international currency and trade items from throughout human history will be on display, as will every bank note series issued by the Bank of Canada since 1935, including the new $10 commemorative note issued to mark the 150th anniversary of Confederation.
Notes to editors:
The opening of the Bank of Canada Museum marks the final phase of a large-scale renewal project undertaken by the Bank of Canada to bring its head office facility up to modern safety, security and structural standards.
The 2016 renewal preserved the cultural and historical significance of the building while addressing 21st century business needs."
"Household vulnerabilities have moved higher, but the financial system remains resilient",2017-06-08,"Household indebtedness and housing market imbalances—the most important vulnerabilities for the Canadian financial system—have moved higher over the past six months, the Bank of Canada said today in its Financial System Review (FSR). However, “the financial system remains resilient, and macroeconomic conditions continue to improve,” said Governor Stephen S. Poloz.
Household indebtedness has continued to rise in Canada, driven in large part by growth in mortgage lending in the Toronto and Vancouver areas. Recent federal government measures are improving credit quality in the insured mortgage market. At the same time, the share of uninsured mortgages is increasing, especially in markets with high house prices, with some mortgages showing riskier characteristics.
Imbalances in the Canadian housing market have also grown since December, mainly due to an acceleration in prices in Toronto and surrounding areas. While strong fundamentals are supporting price growth in both the Toronto and Vancouver areas, extrapolative expectations are also playing an important role. Macroprudential and housing policy measures are, however, expected to help mitigate this vulnerability over time.
In this FSR, the Bank assesses two separate risk scenarios related to these vulnerabilities.
The first risk scenario focuses on the financial stability implications of an externally generated severe recession, where a nationwide correction in house prices is only one of the channels through which the economy and the financial system are affected. A rise in unemployment and a decline in household income would impair the ability of some households to service their debts, potentially generating broad financial system and economic stress. This risk has a low probability of materializing, but would have a severe impact should it occur. Improving macroeconomic conditions have reduced the probability of this risk occurring.
The second risk scenario looks more narrowly at a significant house price correction in Toronto, Vancouver and their surrounding areas. A decline in house prices in these areas would be unlikely to generate the kind of widespread rise in unemployment and fall in business profitability assumed in the first risk scenario. As a result, while the likelihood of this second risk scenario materializing is higher than that of the first, its impact would be less severe.
Other risks highlighted in the FSR are a sharp increase in long-term interest rates driven by higher global risk premiums and stress emanating from China or other emerging-market economies. The risk of prolonged weakness in commodity prices, which was rated as low in the December 2016 FSR, has now been removed. The economy’s adjustment to lower oil prices is largely complete, and the financial system has been able to manage the negative effects on households and businesses in commodity-producing regions.
The June issue also features three reports written by Bank of Canada staff:
* first published on 25 May 2017"
Bank of Canada issues commemorative $10 bank note to mark the 150th anniversary of Confederation,2017-06-01,"The Bank of Canada today began circulating the $10 commemorative bank note that celebrates the 150th anniversary of Confederation. Canadians can now obtain this special note at financial institutions. Only 40 million notes are being issued—roughly one for every Canadian.
Governor Stephen S. Poloz was among the first to spend a commemorative note at a store in downtown Ottawa this morning. “This bank note reflects the pride we feel about our country’s accomplishments and the hope we have for our future,” said Governor Poloz. “But it also underpins the confidence Canadians can have in their bank notes.  The new security features of this $10 note make it the most secure Canadian bank note to date.”
The new security features include a colour-shifting image of an arch found in the Memorial Chamber on Parliament Hill, as well as three-dimensional maple leaves. Like the security features of all polymer bank notes, they are easy to verify and difficult to counterfeit.
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Ginette Petitpas Taylor, said she hoped the bank note would inspire Canadians. “This year, Canadians will have the opportunity to reflect on our history and celebrate our heritage. With this note to commemorate 150 years of Confederation, we are reminded of our strengths: our rich diversity and our enduring hope for a brighter tomorrow,” she said.
The Canada 150 bank note celebrates Canada’s history, land and culture, as the country marks this important milestone.
Four Canadians who played significant roles in the country’s parliamentary history are portrayed on the front of the note: Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada’s first prime minister; Sir George-Étienne Cartier, a principal architect of Canadian federalism; Agnes Macphail, the first woman elected to the Canadian House of Commons; and James Gladstone, or Akay-na-muka (his Blackfoot name), Canada’s first senator of First Nations origin.
The design also incorporates other cultural elements: a reproduction of the artwork Owl’s Bouquet by world-renowned Inuit artist Kenojuak Ashevak and the distinctive arrow sash pattern, an important symbol of the Métis nation that also pays homage to the French-Canadian voyageurs of the 18th century.
The reverse of the note features the rugged splendour of Canada’s lands and landscapes: the Lions/Twin Sisters (Western Canada), a wheat field (Prairie provinces), the Canadian Shield (Central Canada), Cape Bonavista (Eastern Canada) and the northern lights (Northern Canada).
Beginning today, the commemorative bank note will be available over the counter at financial institutions across the country. While the commemorative $10 note does not replace the current Polymer series $10 note, which continues to circulate, it is of equal value and can be used in transactions.

Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1/2 per cent,2015-09-09,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent.
Inflation has evolved in line with the outlook in the Bank’s July Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Total CPI inflation remains near the bottom of the target range, reflecting year-over-year price declines for consumer energy products. Core inflation has been close to 2 per cent, with disinflationary pressures from economic slack being offset by transitory effects of the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar and some sector-specific factors. The dynamics of GDP growth in Canada outlined in July’s MPR also remain intact. The stimulative effects of previous monetary policy actions are working their way through the Canadian economy.
Canada’s resource sector continues to adjust to lower prices for oil and other commodities, with some spillover to the rest of the economy. These adjustments are complex and are expected to take considerable time. Economic activity continues to be underpinned by solid household spending and a firm recovery in the United States, with particular strength in the sectors of the U.S. economy that are important for Canadian exports.
Increasing uncertainty about growth prospects for China and other emerging-market economies, in contrast, is raising questions about the pace of the global recovery. This has contributed to heightened financial market volatility and lower commodity prices. Movements in the Canadian dollar are helping to absorb some of the impact of lower commodity prices and are facilitating the adjustments taking place in Canada’s economy. While the overall export picture is still uncertain, the latest data confirm that exchange rate-sensitive exports are regaining momentum.
Meanwhile, risks to financial stability are evolving as expected. Taking all of these developments into consideration, the Bank judges that the risks to the outlook for inflation remain within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate. Therefore, the target for the overnight rate remains at 1/2 per cent.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 21 October 2015. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."
Bank of Canada unveils commemorative bank note to celebrate Canada’s 150th anniversary of Confederation,2017-04-07,"Bank of Canada Governor Stephen S. Poloz and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance Ginette Petitpas Taylor today unveiled a commemorative $10 bank note celebrating the 150th anniversary of Confederation. This special note—showcasing our history, land and culture—was revealed during a ceremony at the Bank’s head office in Ottawa. It will enter into circulation on 1 June.
“This bank note is intended to captivate our imagination and instill pride in what we, as a nation, have accomplished,” said Governor Poloz. “It celebrates the natural beauty and majesty of our land and some of the important parliamentarians who helped shape our great country.”
The intricately designed note is unique in many ways. For the first time, four individuals are portrayed on the front of a Canadian bank note: Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir George-Étienne Cartier, Agnes Macphail and James Gladstone or Akay-na-muka—his Blackfoot name. With Parliament’s Hall of Honour in the background, these four parliamentarians remind us that Canada has been shaped by the vision, courage and effort of people of different backgrounds.
Upon circulation, the commemorative note will mark the first time that a Canadian woman and an Indigenous Canadian are depicted as portrait subjects on a Bank of Canada bank note. The design also incorporates Inuit and Metis cultural elements: a colourful reproduction of the artwork Owl’s Bouquet by world-renowned Inuit artist Kenojuak Ashevak; and the distinctive arrow sash pattern, an important symbol of the Métis nation.
“Canada’s diversity is our greatest strength,” said Ms. Petitpas Taylor. “As we celebrate Canada 150 we are reminded of what makes us who we are—from our shared history, to our cultures and languages to the breathtaking natural beauty that is instantly recognized around the world. On behalf of the Government of Canada I thank Governor Poloz and the Bank of Canada for their contribution to this truly national celebration.”
The Canada 150 note also showcases Canada’s natural beauty and unique landscapes. Five different landscapes representing the various regions of Canada are featured on the other side of the note: the Lions/Twin Sisters (Western Canada), a wheat field (Prairie provinces), the Canadian Shield (Central Canada), Cape Bonavista (Eastern Canada) and the Northern lights (Northern Canada).
The commemorative $10 note also has new security features, including a colour-shifting arch depicting an arch found in the Memorial Chamber on Parliament Hill, as well as three-dimensional maple leaves.
A comprehensive consultation process was undertaken by the Bank to ensure that this commemorative bank note reflects the input of Canadians. The ideas and suggestions received through public opinion research, consultation and focus groups influenced the note’s content and have been carefully incorporated into the design.
Starting in June, the Bank of Canada will issue 40 million of these commemorative bank notes and distribute them through financial institutions to be broadly available across Canada by 1 July.
The Canada 150 note will circulate alongside the current Polymer series $10 note, but it does not replace it. Both the current $10 note and the commemorative $10 note are of equal value and can be used interchangeably in transactions.
As announced in December, human rights and freedoms icon Viola Desmond will be featured on a new $10 note, which will mark another historic first: Desmond will become the first Canadian woman to be featured on a regularly circulating Bank of Canada bank note, expected in late 2018.

Bank of Canada begins publishing new foreign exchange rate data,2017-03-01,"The Bank of Canada today began publishing new data on the foreign exchange (FX) rate for 26 currencies, intended for statistical, analytical and informational purposes only. As previously announced, these new FX rates will be published once a day, by 16:30 Eastern time (ET), in the form of a single indicative rate per currency pair, which represents a daily average rate for that currency against the Canadian dollar.
To allow time for users of the Bank’s FX rates to make any necessary adjustments, the Bank will continue to publish existing FX rates alongside these new FX rates from 1 March to 28 April 2017. This means that, during this period, the following will continue to be posted at their usual times: noon and closing exchange rates, high and low FX rates for a given period, and all forward exchange rates and forward points.
To accommodate the new rates, the Exchange Rate section of the Bank’s website will be reformatted, and some data will be relocated. The URLs of the existing FX tools will, however, remain the same.
As of 1 May 2017, the Bank will publish the new exchange rate data, as described above, for the 26 currencies only. At that time, it will cease publishing new data for all other existing exchange rates, including noon and closing, high and low, and all forward exchange rates and forward points. The Bank will continue to publish monthly and annual averages for the new FX rates as well as for the Canadian-dollar effective exchange rate index (CERI). Past exchange rate data under the old methodology will remain archived on the Bank’s website.

Bank of Canada announces winners of the second edition of The Governor’s Challenge,2017-02-06,"The Bank of Canada today announced that the team from McGill University won the second annual Governor’s Challenge, a student competition in which teams simulate the role of advisor to the Bank’s policy-makers.
The final round of the monetary policy competition was held at the Bank’s head office in Ottawa on Saturday, 4 February. Governor Stephen S. Poloz awarded the trophy to the winners.
The Governor congratulated all participants and said he hoped the contest would inspire them to work at the Bank of Canada or elsewhere in the public service. “I strongly believe that working to improve your country is a noble calling, and I encourage as many of you as possible to consider it in your career.”
The teams were evaluated on their economic analysis, the quality of their presentations and on evidence of strong teamwork.
The Governor’s Challenge promotes greater awareness of the Canadian economy and of the role of the monetary policy of the Bank of Canada. Undergraduate students in economics and finance give a presentation on the economic outlook and make a monetary policy recommendation to the Bank’s Governing Council, represented by a panel made up of senior executives from the Bank and the private sector.
The judges for the final round were Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri; former Deputy Governor Pierre Duguay; Jing Yang, Deputy Chief of the Bank’s Canadian Economic Analysis Department; and William Robson, President and Chief Executive Officer of the C.D. Howe Institute.
“It was fascinating for us to watch you sitting in our boardroom trying to understand and interpret the data, using macroeconomic theory and considering appropriate policy options,” said Deputy Governor Schembri.
McGill University also won the inaugural competition in 2015–16.
For the 2016–17 edition, 24 universities from across the country participated in the preliminary round of presentations held in November. Five teams were selected for the final round, representing Wilfrid Laurier University, McGill University, the Université de Sherbrooke, the University of Toronto (St. George Campus) and the University of Waterloo.

"Risks to financial stability largely unchanged, household vulnerabilities remain key concern",2016-12-15,"The overall level of risk to Canada’s financial system remains largely unchanged from six months ago, the Bank of Canada said today in the Financial System Review (FSR). The Bank continues to highlight two key vulnerabilities related to Canadian households: high levels of indebtedness and housing market imbalances. A third ongoing vulnerability is the potential for fragility in fixed-income market liquidity.
Nonetheless, the Canadian financial system remains resilient as the nation’s economy improves and financial reforms in Canada and worldwide progress.
Since June, the proportion of highly indebted households has continued to rise in many cities, notably in the Greater Toronto Area. Nationally, house prices continue to increase relative to income, although significant regional divergences persist. Imbalances in some regional housing markets make it more likely that adverse economic shocks could cause large declines in prices.
This buildup of vulnerabilities will be mitigated over time by new federal housing finance rules and other housing sector policies, which will dampen activity in the sector and improve the quality of new mortgages. While the impact of these measures will be concentrated in regions where house prices are the highest relative to income, such as Vancouver, Toronto and Calgary, they will also have important effects at a national level.
“These macroprudential policies will raise the underlying quality of household indebtedness over time, as well as financial institutions’ capital requirements and pricing criteria, which will make them more resilient to future shocks,” Governor Stephen S. Poloz said. “Accordingly, these policies will help mitigate financial stability risks over time.”
In view of the household vulnerabilities identified in the FSR, the most important risk remains household financial stress and a sharp correction in house prices, triggered by a large and persistent nationwide rise in unemployment. The likelihood of this risk materializing, however, remains low.
Other key risks are a sharp increase in long-term interest rates driven by higher global risk premiums, stress emanating from China and emerging-market economies, and prolonged weakness in commodity prices.
The December issue also features three reports written by Bank of Canada staff:"
Bank of Canada announces details of forthcoming changes to its published foreign exchange rate data,2016-12-01,"The Bank of Canada today announced a final list of the 26 foreign currency exchange rates that it will continue to publish after 1 March 2017. The Bank also released the new calculation methodology that will be used for these rates.
The 26 currencies to be published effective 1 March are: (in alphabetical order):
This list of currencies captures the vast majority of foreign exchange transactions conducted against the Canadian dollar and reflects the combination of the top 20 currencies by trading volume (based on the Bank for International Settlements Triennial FX Turnover Survey) and those of Canada’s top 20 trading partners (based on Statistics Canada’s International Merchandise Trade data). This list will be reviewed and adjusted, if required, every three years.
These new FX rates will be published once a day, by 16:30 ET, in the form of a single indicative rate per currency pair, which represents a daily average rate for that currency against the Canadian dollar.  
To allow time for users of the Bank’s FX rates to make any necessary adjustments, the Bank plans to publish these new FX rates alongside our existing FX rates between 1 March and 28 April 2017.
As of 1 May 2017, the Bank will publish exchange rate data as described above for only these 26 currencies.

"#bankNOTEable Canadian woman will be revealed on 8 December, Bank of Canada publishes short list of five",2016-11-24,"On Thursday, 8 December 2016, the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Bank of Canada will reveal which iconic Canadian woman will be featured on the next regularly circulating bank note, expected in 2018.
In advance of that announcement, the Bank today published the short list from which the #bankNOTEable woman will be chosen.
An independent Advisory Council short-listed these five iconic Canadian women earlier this year for consideration by the Minister of Finance.
They are (in alphabetical order):
The women were selected from 461 eligible nominees submitted by Canadians during an open call for nominations, launched by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on International Women’s Day, 8 March 2016.
More than 26,300 submissions were received from Canadians over a five-week period. The Advisory Council initially reduced these nominations to a long list of 12 women, guided by the following principles: Canada is comprised of many different communities; the women who appear on the long list should resonate with Canadians and reflect the diversity of Canada; and their achievements must be seen in the context of the time in which they lived.
In compiling their short list, Advisory Council members agreed that these five women best articulated the Council’s ultimate selection criteria: that nominees should have broken or overcome barriers, made a significant change, left a lasting legacy, and be inspirational.
“The Advisory Council had the difficult task of selecting only five outstanding Canadian women from a vast field of strong choices, and I commend the members for their excellent work,” said Governor Stephen S. Poloz. “I am also delighted that this entire process encouraged a meaningful conversation among Canadians about the many exceptional women who have shaped our country.”
“Canadian women made our country what it is today, and they deserve a place on our currency,” said Minister of Finance Bill Morneau. “Thanks to the work of the Council members and to the thousands who participated in the conversation, a new generation of young women and girls will be inspired by the stories of those who contributed so much to our society, our values and our history. And, in 2018, we will all have a constant reminder of these exceptional accomplishments to carry around with us wherever we go.”"
Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target,2006-11-23,"The primary objective of Canada's monetary policy is to enhance the  well-being of Canadians by contributing to sustained economic growth, rising  levels of employment and improved living standards. Experience has clearly shown  that the best way monetary policy can achieve this goal is by giving Canadian  households and businesses confidence in the value of their money.
It has been 15 years since Canada adopted an inflation-targeting framework to  guide its monetary policy. During this time, Consumer Price Index (CPI)  inflation has been reduced to a low, stable and predictable level of close to 2  per cent, real output has expanded at an average rate of 3 per cent per year and  the unemployment rate has fallen to 30-year lows. Although a generally  supportive international environment, coupled with significant domestic economic  reforms and a prudent fiscal policy track, has played an important role in these  positive developments, a key contributor has been Canada's monetary policy under  the inflation-targeting framework. The joint commitment of the Government of  Canada and the Bank of Canada to the inflation targets has helped anchor  inflation expectations. It has also provided a more stable and certain economic  environment in which Canadians can make their investment and spending  decisions.
Based on this positive experience, the Government of Canada and the Bank of  Canada agree to renew the inflation target on the following basis:
The Bank will continue its ongoing research into potential improvements in  the monetary policy framework. Before the end of 2011, the Government and the  Bank will review the experience over the period and the results of the research,  and determine the appropriate target for the years ahead.
The commitment by the Government and the Bank to this inflation-control  target will ensure that Canadians continue to derive the economic and social  benefits from low, stable and predictable inflation and will underpin confidence  in Canada's economic prospects in the coming years.

Bank of Canada Calls for Nominations for the 2017 Fellowship and Governor’s Awards,2016-09-28,"The Bank of Canada is calling for nominations under its Fellowship Program for 2017. This program provides monetary awards to foster excellence in economic and financial research in Canada, and supports the Bank’s development of partnerships with leading experts.
Canadian universities are invited to nominate exceptional academics for one or both of the two prestigious research awards available through this program: the Fellowship Award and the Governor’s Award.
The Bank of Canada promotes the economic and financial welfare of Canada through its activities in four main areas: monetary policy, currency, the financial system and funds management. The financial crisis and its aftermath have shown that issues related to central banking go beyond traditional monetary policy theory. The Bank therefore wishes to encourage applications from candidates across a broad range of fields.
The Fellowship Award provides financial support to leading academics who are widely recognized for their expertise and excellence in areas important to the Bank’s mandate, and whose innovative research contributes to the development of knowledge and research capabilities in those areas. The award is for a term of up to five years and recipients must be professors in tenure or tenure-track positions at a Canadian university.
The Governor’s Award provides funding for a term of up to two years to exceptional assistant, associate and full professors at Canadian universities who have demonstrated the potential to make exemplary research contributions in fields supporting the Bank’s mandate. Candidates must have obtained a PhD within the past 10 years.

Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity in Canada during April 2016,2016-09-01,"During the month of April, the Bank of Canada and 51 other central banks and monetary authorities conducted the latest survey of turnover activity in the foreign exchange and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets in their respective countries. This worldwide effort was coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and is undertaken every three years.
The purpose of the survey is to obtain global, comprehensive, and consistent information on the size and structure of the foreign exchange and OTC derivatives markets. The data are collected to increase market transparency and to help central banks, market participants, and others better understand and monitor patterns of activity in global financial markets.
The Bank of Canada is releasing the summary results of its survey today, as are many other participating central banks. As well, the BIS is issuing a press release that summarizes highlights of the aggregated global turnover.1 Canada has participated in this survey since 1983, and summary results of earlier surveys are shown in Tables 1 through 4 and 7.
Almost all dealers in Canada that are active in the wholesale foreign exchange and derivatives markets were surveyed. These 14 financial institutions are estimated to be involved in approximately 98 per cent of the transactions executed in Canada.2 With respect to foreign exchange, the survey covered spot transactions, outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps, currency swaps,3 and OTC options. The interest rate products covered were forward-rate agreements, interest rate swaps, and OTC options. Participants were also asked to identify transactions by currency and type of counterparty, and, in the case of foreign exchange, they were asked to identify the execution method for each transaction.
The turnover part of the triennial survey is conducted on the basis of residence or location. In particular, the basis for reporting is the country in which the sales desk of a trade is located.4 Where no sales desk is involved in a deal, the trading desk is used to determine the location. Although there was some variation in their individual qualitative assessments, on average, reporting dealers in Canada indicated that turnover activity during the month of April was normal and that activity was steady to increasing compared to the previous six months.
Additional tables on the results of the Canadian survey, including detailed tables on amounts outstanding, will be made available on the FX Volumes and Rates of the Canadian Foreign Exchange Committee’s (CFEC’s) website (<www.cfec.ca>) later this year. These will be published after the release of the final comprehensive global report of the BIS on the 2016 survey. CFEC’s website will contain a direct link to that report once it is available."
Bank of Canada recognizes Saskatoon Police Service with Counterfeit Deterrence award,2016-08-16,"The Bank of Canada today presented three members of the Saskatoon Police Service (SPS) Economic Crime Section with the 2016 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence.
This award, which has been presented since 2004, recognizes the outstanding achievements of criminal justice professionals and educators involved in the prevention and deterrence of bank note counterfeiting in Canada.
This year’s recipients exemplified collaborative policing. Through teamwork, sound investigative techniques and diligent intelligence gathering, the police officers were able to quickly secure evidence, lay a number of charges and obtain a successful conviction against an individual responsible for producing and passing counterfeit currency throughout Saskatoon.
In presenting the award, Richard Wall, Chief of the Bank’s Currency Department, remarked, “While not particularly large by national or international standards, this investigation of a local counterfeiting operation was worthy of merit since it involved exemplary police work. Strong co-operation among police officers and an appreciation of the potential impact this type of crime has on victims emerged as the hallmarks of this successful investigation.” 
Sgt. Dave Kozicki, Sgt. Lisa Nowosad and Cst. Mike Scanlan were honoured in the presence of their peers at the annual Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police Conference in Ottawa, Ontario.

"Overall risks to financial stability are largely unchanged, but household vulnerabilities have moved higher",2016-06-09,"The overall level of risk to Canada’s financial system is largely unchanged from six months ago, the Bank of Canada said today in its biannual Financial System Review (FSR). While household vulnerabilities have moved higher, the ongoing economic recovery in Canada means that the overall risk remains the same. The Canadian financial system is resilient and functioning effectively.
The Bank continues to highlight two vulnerabilities related to Canadian households: the elevated level of household indebtedness and imbalances in some regional housing markets. A third vulnerability identified is the fragility of fixed-income market liquidity.
Strong regional divergences persist among housing markets. Job losses have increased financial stress for some highly indebted households in the regions most affected by low commodity prices. Meanwhile, in the greater Vancouver and Toronto areas, rapidly rising house prices and strong mortgage credit growth are increasing the share of highly indebted households. In these two markets, it is unlikely that economic fundamentals will justify continued strong price increases.
“This suggests that prospective homebuyers and their lenders should not extrapolate recent real estate performance into the future when contemplating a transaction,” said Governor Stephen S. Poloz.
The vulnerabilities described in the FSR could propagate shocks throughout the financial system if a major event were to trigger one of the identified risks. The most important continues to be a severe recession and an ensuing sharp increase in unemployment that impairs debt service and leads to a broad-based correction in house prices. The probability remains low as the economy continues to grow, supported by continued expansion in the United States, and accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus in Canada.
Other key risks identified are a sharp increase in interest rates due to higher global risk premiums, stress emanating from China and other emerging-market economies, and a prolonged weakness in commodity prices.
Published twice a year, the FSR is intended to raise early awareness of the key vulnerabilities and risks to the Canadian financial system. It focuses on downside risks, rather than the most likely future path for the financial system.
The June issue of the FSR also features two reports written by Bank of Canada staff:"
"Monetary/fiscal policy mix has implications for debt and financial stability, Governor Poloz says",2016-06-04,"The mix of monetary and fiscal policies in an economy has important implications for debt levels and financial stability over the medium term, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen S. Poloz said today.
In the Doug Purvis Memorial Lecture given at the Canadian Economics Association’s annual conference, Governor Poloz used the Bank’s main policy model to construct three “counterfactual” scenarios of events from the past 30 years that show how different policy mixes can influence the amount of debt taken on by the private and public sectors.
Tight monetary policy with easy fiscal policy may lead to the same growth and inflation results as easy monetary policy paired with tight fiscal policy in a given situation, the Governor explained. However, the consequences for government and private sector debt levels would be quite different.
Recent experience in Canada and elsewhere shows that debt levels—whether public or private—can provoke financial stability concerns, said Governor Poloz. The insight about policy mix is important as authorities worldwide work to incorporate financial stability issues into the conduct of monetary policy, he added.
The Governor stressed that the counterfactuals are intended to illustrate the impact of the policy mix on debt levels; they aren’t meant to be taken as an opinion about what the best policy mix was in the past or is now.
“Hindsight is always 20:20 and such a discussion would have little meaning,” Governor Poloz said. “The best mix of monetary and fiscal policy will depend on the economic situation.”
There should be a degree of coordination between the monetary and fiscal authorities that allows both to be adequately informed of each other’s policies and consider their implications on debt levels over the medium term, the Governor said. In Canada’s case, the central bank operates under an explicit inflation-targeting agreement with the federal government that enshrines its operational independence, while allowing for both parties to share information and judgment, Poloz said. This framework represents “a simple yet elegant form” of policy coordination, he noted.
The lecture honours Doug Purvis, a Canadian macroeconomist and Queen’s University professor. In 1985, Purvis delivered the Harold Innis Lecture, in which he argued that rising government debt levels would eventually compromise the ability of authorities to implement stabilization policies. Governor Poloz said his lecture today is meant to build on Purvis’ initial insights by bringing more advanced macroeconomic models to bear on the topic, and linking them to the topical issue of financial stability."

Bank of Canada designates Automated Clearing Settlement System under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act,2016-05-02,"The Governor of the Bank of Canada has designated, effective 2 May 2016, the Automated Clearing Settlement System (ACSS) for oversight under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act (PCSA) as a clearing and settlement system that has the potential to pose payments system risk. The ACSS is owned and operated by the Canadian Payments Association (CPA), an organization established by the Canadian Payments Act to operate national payment systems.
The ACSS is being designated following the expansion of the Bank’s oversight responsibilities in December 2014 to include systems that have the potential to pose payments system risk (referred to as Prominent Payment Systems). A disruption or failure of a Prominent Payment System could cause a significant adverse effect on economic activity in Canada, potentially leading to a general loss of confidence in the overall Canadian payments system.
Each day the ACSS clears the majority of non-cash retail payments in Canada, or almost 27 million transactions with a value of $24.7 billion, on average. Given the variety of payments cleared, several without immediate substitutes, and the importance of those payments for a broad range of economic activity, it is considered to be central to the Canadian payments system.1
Designation brings the system under the formal oversight of the Bank of Canada, which requires compliance with Risk Management Standards for Prominent Payment Systems. These are based on the CPMI-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI); amended to reflect the different risks posed by Prominent Payment Systems compared to systems designated as systemically important. Designation also provides the system with legal protections that are important to the finality of payments.
The Minister of Finance has confirmed that he is of the opinion that designation of the ACSS is in the public interest.
Under the PCSA, the Bank of Canada has formal responsibility for the designation and oversight of clearing and settlement systems that have the potential to pose systemic, or payments system risk.
Since the PCSA was adopted in 1996, five financial market infrastructures have been previously designated by the Bank as having the potential to pose systemic risk: the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS), which clears and settles large-value Canadian-dollar payments; CDSX, which clears and settles securities transactions; CLS Bank, a global system for the settlement of foreign exchange transactions; SwapClear, the dominant global system for centrally clearing over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps (IRS); and the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Service, which centrally clears fixed-income and derivatives contracts.
In 2014, the federal government amended the act to give the Bank of Canada the additional responsibility to oversee payment systems that, while not systemically important, have the potential to pose payments system risk. The ACSS is the only system to have received this designation by the Bank.

Bank of Canada announces recipients of 2016 Fellowship and Governor’s awards,2016-04-15,"The Bank of Canada is pleased to announce Professor Daniel Trefler from the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto and Professor Francesco Trebbi from the University of British Columbia’s Vancouver School of Economics as the 2016 recipients of the Bank’s Fellowship Award. The Bank of Canada is also pleased to present this year’s Governor’s Award to Associate Professor Liyan Yang, also of the Rotman School of Management.
Professor Trefler is an internationally respected trade economist, known for his contributions to public policy formation in Canada. His current research focuses on the domestic and international levers for promoting Canadian competitiveness.
Professor Trebbi’s research interests are in political economy and macroeconomics, with emphasis on monetary and fiscal policy. He is the first recipient of both awards offered through the Bank’s Fellowship Program, having previously won the Governor’s Award in 2012.
Professor Yang’s primary research interests are in asset pricing, behavioural finance and information economics. His current agenda focuses on information transmission and production in financial markets and related regulation issues.
On the award recipients, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen S. Poloz said,
“The Bank of Canada is delighted to present the Fellowship Award to two exceptional economists with remarkable records of path-breaking research.

Bank of Canada launches public consultation to select Canadian woman to be on next series bank note,2016-03-08,"As announced today by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Minister of Finance Bill Morneau, the Bank of Canada is undertaking a broad public consultation to select an iconic Canadian woman to be featured on the first bank note of its next series. This new note will be issued in 2018.
“In our country's nearly 150 year history, women, with the notable exception of the Queen, have largely been unrepresented on our bank notes,” said Minister Morneau. “In 2018, we will bring real change to a new generation of women who will carry with them constant reminders that they are not only Canada’s future, but a celebrated part of our history.”

Bank of Canada Announces Future Changes to its Published Foreign Exchange Rate Data,2016-02-16,"The Bank of Canada today announced that, effective 1 March 2017, it will make a series of changes to the number, frequency and calculation methodology of its published foreign exchange (FX) rates.
Although these changes will not come into effect until 2017, the Bank is notifying the public now to allow ample time for users of these rates to make any adjustments that may be required.
The changes are:
These changes reinforce the distinction between FX rate fixings used as benchmarks for transactional purposes and Bank of Canada exchange rates that are provided as a public good – for statistical, analytical and informational purposes only.
They are being implemented after broad public consultation (including almost 17,000 responses to a 2014 Bank of Canada survey), and are being undertaken in the context of broader international official sector work on the design of foreign exchange reference rates.
They take into account the ongoing international work on financial benchmarks, including recommendations from the Financial Stability Board (FSB) on foreign exchange benchmarks and the Principles for Financial Benchmarks published by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).

Bank of Canada announces winners of The Governor’s Challenge student competition,2016-02-16,"The Bank of Canada today announced the winners of The Governor’s Challenge, a new student competition in which teams simulate the role of advisor to the Bank’s Governing Council.
The team from McGill University earned the title of national champion for their performance in the final round of the competition at the Bank’s head office in Ottawa on Saturday, 13 February.
In awarding The Governor’s Challenge trophy to the winners, Governor Stephen S. Poloz told the finalists, “This inaugural competition has been a tremendous success. It’s clear from the great set of presentations that you’ve developed a deeper understanding of the Canadian economy and of the Bank of Canada’s role in it and have acquired invaluable skills that will serve you well in the future. Congratulations to McGill University and to all those who participated.”
The Governor said he hoped the Bank’s increased engagement with students through the Challenge and other initiatives would inspire them to pursue careers in the public service. “I encourage you to consider applying your skills and knowledge to the betterment of Canada.”
The competition, which requires students to give a presentation on the economic outlook and a monetary policy recommendation to the Bank’s Governing Council, is designed to promote greater awareness of the Canadian economy and the role of the central bank and monetary policy. It is targeted at third- and fourth-year undergraduate students enrolled in Canadian post-secondary institutions and faculty members who act as coaches.
For the 2015–16 school year, 22 universities from across the country participated in the first round of presentations held in November. Five teams were selected for the final, national round. They were the University of Saskatchewan, Wilfrid Laurier University, University of Toronto (St. George campus), McGill University and St. Francis Xavier University.
The judges for the final round were Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri; Michael Ehrmann, Chief of Economic and Financial Research at the Bank; and William Robson, president and CEO of the C.D. Howe Institute. They evaluated the teams on the substance of their economic analysis, the quality of their presentation and evidence of strong teamwork.
Deputy Governor Schembri closed the competition by congratulating the students and coaches on the quality of their presentations. “You should be proud of your achievements,” he said. “I hope you enjoyed the experience as much as I did. I look forward to future successful years of The Governor’s Challenge.”

"Expect policy divergence as economies adjust to shocks, Governor Poloz says",2016-01-07,"Diverging monetary policies are the natural consequence of large declines in resource prices and should be expected, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen S. Poloz said in a speech today at the Mayor’s Breakfast Series in Ottawa.
Last month’s interest rate increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve is the first step in a long process toward normalizing monetary policy in the United States, the Governor said. While this will have implications for Canada and its financial markets, the Bank of Canada is well equipped to respond. “We have a number of tools at our disposal—both conventional and unconventional—to mitigate risks to our inflation target or to our financial system, should they arise,” he said.
The drop in resource prices has meant large declines in the terms of trade for resource-producing countries such as Canada, Governor Poloz explained. This shock is reversing trends established in Canada over the past decade, and policy-makers should facilitate the necessary economic adjustments. “The forces that have been set in motion simply must work themselves out,” the Governor said.
“This is exactly why countries choose to have flexible exchange rates,” Governor Poloz explained. The currency depreciation is operating through three channels. First, it is offsetting part of the drop in commodity prices. Second, it is helping promote growth in non-resource sectors through stronger exports. Third, and less desirably, it is spreading the impact of the loss of income across the entire economy, he said.
Still, “a flexible exchange rate is not a policy panacea,” Governor Poloz said. Other policies can also serve as buffers “while still encouraging the necessary longer-term adjustments, including fiscal policies and policies that make labour markets more flexible,” he said.
“We’ve been in this situation before,” the Governor concluded. “The Bank of Canada will continue to run an independent monetary policy, anchored by our inflation target, and we will use our tools to manage risks along the way.”"
"Bank of Canada says housing vulnerabilities have edged higher, but financial system remains resilient",2015-12-15,"Vulnerabilities in the housing sector have edged higher, the Bank of Canada said today in its Financial System Review (FSR), while the overall level of risk to Canada’s financial system has remained roughly unchanged since June.
The Bank continues to identify two key vulnerabilities related to the Canadian household sector: the elevated level of household indebtedness, and imbalances in the housing market. A third vulnerability relates to uncertain market liquidity in fixed-income markets.
Nonetheless, the Bank believes that the Canadian financial system is resilient and that the global financial system has been made safer through the implementation of recent reforms, most notably larger capital and liquidity buffers at major financial institutions.
The Bank’s base-case scenario continues to predict a constructive evolution of housing imbalances, said Governor Stephen S. Poloz. “Housing activity should stabilize in line with economic growth, as the driver of growth in the economy switches from household spending to non-resource exports. Certain vulnerabilities are still edging higher, but recent changes by Canadian authorities to the rules for mortgage financing will help to mitigate these risks as we move into 2016.”
Household vulnerabilities could be exacerbated by a severe recession that is accompanied by a widespread and prolonged rise in unemployment. This could reduce the ability of households to service their debt and cause serious and broad-based declines in house prices.This is the most important risk outlined in the FSR, but its probability of occurring remains low. The drop in commodity prices in 2015 has reduced Canadian incomes and wealth, but to date there is no evidence of a significant increase in loan delinquency rates.
The other key risks identified in the FSR are a sudden increase in global risk premiums which would lead to higher borrowing rates; stress emanating from China and other emerging-market economies; and prolonged weakness in commodity prices.
The FSR, published twice a year, is intended to raise early awareness of vulnerabilities and potential triggers that could turn them into a risk to the Canadian financial system. It focuses on downside risks and is not a prediction of the most likely outcomes.
The December FSR includes two reports that further refine the Bank’s analysis of the housing sector:"

Working in teams, students analyze and forecast developments in the Canadian economy and develop a monetary policy recommendation. They present their work and recommendation to a panel of Bank of Canada judges, who evaluate the teams on the substance of their analysis, the quality of their presentation and evidence of strong teamwork.
The competition takes place in two parts. It began on 27 November 2015 with a first round of presentations via video conference. From among the competitors, the judges selected five finalists, representing the following universities:
On 13 February 2016, these five teams will compete against each other at the Bank’s head office in Ottawa to earn the title of The Governor’s Challenge national champion.

Deputy Governor Agathe Côté to retire from the Bank of Canada,2015-10-26,"The Bank of Canada announced today that Deputy Governor Agathe Côté will retire at the end of January 2016.
Agathe Côté was appointed Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada in July 2010, with responsibility for overseeing the Bank’s analysis of domestic economic developments in support of monetary policy decisions. As a member of the Bank’s Governing Council, she has shared responsibility for decisions with respect to monetary policy and financial system stability, and for setting the strategic direction of the Bank.
Ms. Côté joined the Bank in 1982 as an economist in the International Department and, later, in the Department of Monetary and Financial Analysis. During her career at the Bank, she served as Deputy Chief of Monetary and Financial Analysis as well as Financial Markets, and as Chief of the Bank’s Research Department (now Canadian Economic Analysis). In 2008, Ms. Côté was appointed Secretary to the Governing Council for Monetary Policy and Adviser to the Governor, with responsibilities for domestic and international monetary policy issues. Ms. Côté has also been a member of Statistics Canada’s Advisory Committee on National Accounts.
Governor Stephen S. Poloz thanked Ms. Côté for her important influence on the Bank’s policy and its research during her 33 years of service.
“I first met Agathe when she interviewed at the Bank over thirty years ago,” Governor Poloz said. “I suspected then what we all know today - that Agathe's contribution to the Bank would prove to be extraordinary, and lasting.”
The process to appoint a new Deputy Governor will begin before the end of this year."
Bank of Canada Calls for Nominations for the 2016 Fellowship and Governor’s Awards,2015-09-25,"The Bank of Canada is calling for nominations under its Fellowship Program for 2016. This program fosters excellence in economic and financial research in Canada, and develops partnerships with experts outside of the Bank.
Canadian universities are invited to nominate exceptional academics for the two prestigious research awards available through this program: the Fellowship Award and the Governor’s Award.
The Bank of Canada promotes the economic and financial welfare of Canada through its activities in four main areas: monetary policy, currency, the financial system and funds management.   The recent experience of the financial crisis and its aftermath has shown that issues related to central banking go beyond traditional monetary policy theory. The Bank therefore wishes to encourage applications from candidates across a broad range of fields.
The Fellowship Award provides financial support to academics who are widely recognized for their expertise and excellence in areas important to the Bank’s mandate, and whose leading-edge research contributes to the development of knowledge and research capabilities in those areas. The award is for a term of up to five years and recipients must be professors in tenure or tenure-track positions at a Canadian university.
The Governor’s Award provides funding for a term of up to two years to exceptional assistant, associate and full professors at Canadian universities who have demonstrated the potential to make exemplary research contributions in fields supporting the Bank’s mandate. Candidates must have obtained a PhD within the ten years preceding their nomination for the award.
Nominations for these awards must be submitted by Friday, 13 November 2015. For more information on the Fellowship Program, award requirements and the nomination process, please visit the Bank’s website or call 613 782-8888."
Bank of Canada Unveils and Issues Commemorative $20 Bank Note,2015-09-09,"At an official ceremony at Rideau Hall, the Bank of Canada today unveiled and issued a special commemorative $20 bank note honouring Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. As of this day, Elizabeth II’s reign exceeds that of her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, making Her Majesty the longest-reigning sovereign in Canada’s modern era.
The commemorative bank note is a variation of the existing $20 polymer bank note that already features a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. The new note is identical to the current $20 note, with one distinct difference: its large window contains a range of special design elements, including a portrait of Her Majesty wearing a crown (tiara) for the first time on a Canadian bank note. The portrait is based on a 1951 image by renowned Canadian photographer Yousuf Karsh – the same photograph that inspired the portrait engraving of the Queen, without the crown, for the 1954 Canadian Landscape series of bank notes and the 1967 commemorative note celebrating Confederation. Since her accession to the throne in 1952, an image of Her Majesty has appeared on every series of Canadian bank notes.
The Bank of Canada’s Chief of Currency, Richard Wall, unveiled the commemorative note, together with the Governor General of Canada, His Excellency the Right Honourable David Johnston.
“This is a unique milestone in the history of the monarchy in our country, and the Bank of Canada is honoured to mark the occasion in this special way. Over Her Majesty’s reign, the technology behind our bank notes has continually evolved – to the state-of-the-art polymer notes we have today. It is therefore fitting that we are commemorating this historic occasion by using one of the most advanced security features of our current notes – the large holographic window,” said Mr. Wall.
The Bank of Canada will issue 40 million commemorative notes, the first of which will start to be available at financial institutions across Canada tomorrow. They will circulate alongside the existing $20 note, which will continue to be issued and will comprise the vast majority of $20 notes in circulation.

Bank of Canada Publishes 2016 Schedule for Policy Interest Rate Announcements and Release of the Monetary Policy Report,2015-07-27,"The Bank of Canada today published its 2016 schedule of the key dates for policy interest rate announcements and release of the quarterly Monetary Policy Report, and it reconfirmed the scheduled announcement dates for the remainder of this year.
The scheduled announcement dates from September 2015 through December 2015 are reconfirmed as follows:
The scheduled announcement dates for 2016 are the following:
*Monetary Policy Report published
All rate announcements will be made at 10:00 (ET), and the Monetary Policy Report will continue to be published concurrently with the January, April, July and October rate announcements."
Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target to 1/2 per cent,2015-07-15,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent.
Total CPI inflation in Canada has been around 1 per cent in recent months, reflecting year-over-year price declines for consumer energy products. Core inflation has been close to 2 per cent, with disinflationary pressures from economic slack being offset by transitory effects of the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar and some sector-specific factors. Setting aside these transitory effects, the Bank judges that the underlying trend in inflation is about 1.5 to 1.7 per cent.
Global growth faltered in early 2015, principally in the United States and China.  Recent indicators suggest a rebound in the U.S. economy in the second half of this year, and growth is expected to be solid through the projection. In contrast, China is slowing amid an ongoing process of rebalancing to a more sustainable growth path. This has pulled down prices of certain commodities that are important to Canada’s exports. Financial conditions in major economies remain very accommodative and continue to provide much-needed support to economic activity. Global growth is expected to strengthen over the second half of 2015, averaging about 3 per cent for the year, and accelerate to around 3 1/2 per cent in 2016 and 2017.
The Bank’s estimate of growth in Canada in 2015 has been marked down considerably from its April projection. The downward revision reflects further downgrades of business investment plans in the energy sector, as well as weaker-than-expected exports of non-energy commodities and non-commodities.  Real GDP is now projected to have contracted modestly in the first half of the year, resulting in higher excess capacity and additional downward pressure on inflation.
The Bank expects growth to resume in the third quarter and begin to exceed potential again in the fourth quarter, led by the non-resource sectors of Canada’s economy. Outside the energy-producing regions, consumer confidence remains high and labour markets continue to improve. This will support consumption, which will also receive a fiscal boost. Recent evidence suggests a pickup in activity and rising capacity pressures among manufacturers, particularly those exporters that are most sensitive to movements in the Canadian dollar. Financial conditions for households and businesses remain very stimulative.
The Bank now projects Canada’s real GDP will grow by just over 1 per cent in 2015 and about 2 1/2 per cent in 2016 and 2017. With this revised growth profile, the output gap is significantly larger than was expected in April, and closes somewhat later. The Bank anticipates that the economy will return to full capacity and inflation to 2 per cent on a sustained basis in the first half of 2017.
The lower outlook for Canadian growth has increased the downside risks to inflation. While vulnerabilities associated with household imbalances remain elevated and could edge higher, Canada’s economy is undergoing a significant and complex adjustment. Additional monetary stimulus is required at this time to help return the economy to full capacity and inflation sustainably to target.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 9 September 2015. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the Monetary Policy Report on 21 October 2015."
"Bank of Canada says risk to financial stability is slightly higher, but system is more resilient",2015-06-11,"The overall risk to financial stability in Canada has risen in the face of lower oil prices, but the resilience of the system continues to improve, the Bank of Canada said today as it released its biannualFinancial System Review (FSR).
The FSR is intended to raise awareness of the key vulnerabilities, possible triggers and risks to the financial system. The Bank’s assessment is that there is a low probability that the risks identified in the FSR will materialize. Policies and regulations are in place to promote the strength and soundness of the Canadian financial system.
Elevated household indebtedness remains an important vulnerability in the financial system, as it was at the time of the December FSR. Imbalances in the housing market, which are closely related to the state of household finances, are another key concern highlighted in the report.
“We judge that the vulnerability associated with household indebtedness is edging higher, and the overall risk to financial stability in Canada is slightly higher than it was at the time of our December FSR,” said Governor Stephen S. Poloz.
The vulnerabilities described in the FSR could amplify and propagate shocks throughout the system if an event were to trigger any of the four major risks to financial stability. The most important domestic risk is a broad-based decline in employment and incomes that would significantly reduce the ability of households to service their debt, leading to a widespread correction in house prices.
The oil price shock has increased the risk to financial stability, the FSR states, by delaying improvements to incomes and economic growth and impacting the housing markets of oil-producing regions. However, the decline in oil prices alone is unlikely to trigger a material risk to the system as a whole. The Bank continues to expect the imbalances in the household sector and housing market to ease as the economy improves.
The other key risks identified in the FSR are sharply higher long-term interest rates, globally and in Canada; stress emanating from China and other emerging-market economies; and financial stress from the euro area.
Governor Poloz said significant reforms under way in the global and domestic financial systems are designed to reduce the likelihood and impact of future turmoil. “There is no question the global financial system is now more resilient, thanks to these reforms,” he said. “So, while risks may have edged higher, safeguards to protect the financial system are stronger than they were before.”
The June 2015 FSR includes two reports summarizing recent work by Bank of Canada staff on specific financial sector policies:"
Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 3/4 per cent,2015-03-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 3/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/2 per cent.
Total CPI inflation in Canada has fallen as expected, reflecting the significant drop in oil prices. Core inflation remains close to 2 per cent and continues to be temporarily boosted by the pass-through effects of the lower Canadian dollar, as well as sector-specific factors.
The global economy is evolving broadly in line with projections in the Bank’s January Monetary Policy Report (MPR). The United States remains the main source of momentum in the global economy, while headwinds to growth linger in many regions. In this context, a growing number of central banks have taken actions to ease monetary conditions. Crude oil prices are close to the Bank’s MPR assumptions.
Canadian economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 was consistent with the Bank’s expectations. The oil price shock had a modest early impact on aggregate demand, and a larger effect on income. The Bank continues to expect that most of the negative impact from lower oil prices will appear in the first half of 2015, although it may be even more front-loaded than projected in January. Nevertheless, data for 2014 as a whole suggest the anticipated rotation into stronger growth in non-energy exports and investment is well underway.
Financial conditions in Canada have eased materially since January, in response to the Bank’s recent monetary policy action and to global financial developments. This easing is reflected across the yield curve and in a wide range of asset prices, including the Canadian dollar. These conditions will mitigate the negative effects of the oil price shock, further boosting growth through stronger non-energy exports and investment.
In light of these developments, the risks around the inflation profile are now more balanced and financial stability risks are evolving as expected in January. At present, we judge that the current degree of monetary policy stimulus is still appropriate and the target for the overnight rate remains at 3/4 per cent.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 15 April 2015. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."
Bank of Canada Announces Recipient of 2015 Governor’s Award,2015-03-30,"The Bank of Canada today announced that Professor Matilde Bombardini of the University of British Columbia’s Vancouver School of Economics is the recipient of the Governor’s Award for 2015.
Professor Bombardini is widely recognized as one of the best young trade economists in Canada, with research interests that include the fields of international trade and political economy. Her current research explores the impact of international free trade on the efficient matching of workers to firms, and investigates the relationship between Canadian importing firms and their foreign suppliers for implications on productivity. She is also conducting ongoing empirical work related to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.
“The Bank of Canada is pleased to present the Governor’s Award to Professor Bombardini, a dynamic young economist with a truly impressive research record,” said Stephen S. Poloz, Governor of the Bank of Canada. “In an era when prosperity depends critically on a country’s capacity to compete globally, her substantial contributions to the modern theory of international trade are of real interest to the Bank and the Canadian economy as a whole.”
Awarded through the Bank of Canada’s Fellowship Program, the Governor’s Award recognizes outstanding academics who are at a relatively early stage in their careers and who are working at Canadian universities in areas of research relevant to the Bank. The award, which provides an annual research grant of $25,000, is granted for a non-renewable term of up to two years, subject to a review and confirmation by the Bank’s Governing Council in the last quarter of the first year.
The Fellowship Program includes the Governor’s Award and the Fellowship Award, the latter of which was not conferred in 2015. The Program is designed to encourage leading-edge research and the development of expertise in Canada in a number of areas critical to the Bank’s mandate: macroeconomics, monetary economics and international finance, as well as the economics of financial markets and institutions, including their financial stability.

"Economy Has Room to Grow, Says Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins",2015-02-10,"The Canadian economy still has room to grow, and the sharp drop in oil prices is a setback, Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said in Ottawa today, adding that monetary policy will support the needed adjustments.
As the Bank assesses the underlying inflation pressures in the Canadian economy, it is critical that it consider a broad range of indicators, including those that go beyond the headline unemployment rate, Ms. Wilkins said. Given the destructive recession Canada experienced, measures of economic slack that focus on the labour market show greater unused capacity than broader measures do.
“Understanding the degree of slack in the economy helps us avoid making policy  decisions that could trigger inflationary or disinflationary pressures,” Ms. Wilkins told members of the Ottawa Economics Association. “We don’t want to inadvertently stifle the rebuilding phase of an economy that will need to adjust to a lower price of oil.”
As a net exporter of energy, Canada is now feeling the negative effects of the oil-price shock, which increased the downside risks to inflation. There will be some offsets from a stronger U.S. economy and a weaker Canadian dollar, although these are uncertain and will take longer to materialize.
If low oil prices persist, they will spur a significant reallocation of workers across sectors and regions, as the energy sector cools and non-energy exports take on the mantle of growth.
The labour market and the output gaps will close over time as the economy grows, firm creation and business investment pick up, and as capacity is rebuilt. It is possible that the two gaps will not close simultaneously, as would likely be the case in a more typical business cycle. “An economy pushing up against the limits of its capacity may be just what is required to signal the need for additional investments and to draw workers back into the labour force,” Ms. Wilkins said.
By providing an environment of low and stable inflation, monetary policy is supporting the adjustments needed to return the economy to sustained and balanced growth, Ms. Wilkins concluded. “We’ll get there and it will be a very good thing for Canada.”"
Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target to 3/4 per cent,2015-01-21,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 3/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/2 per cent. This decision is in response to the recent sharp drop in oil prices, which will be negative for growth and underlying inflation in Canada.
Inflation has remained close to the 2 per cent target in recent quarters. Core inflation has been temporarily boosted by sector-specific factors and the pass-through effects of the lower Canadian dollar, which are offsetting disinflationary pressures from slack in the economy and competition in the retail sector. Total CPI inflation is starting to reflect the fall in oil prices.
Oil’s sharp decline in the past six months is expected to boost global economic growth, especially in the United States, while widening the divergences among economies. Persistent headwinds from deleveraging and lingering uncertainty will influence the extent to which some oil-importing countries benefit from lower prices. The Bank’s base-case projection assumes oil prices around US$60 per barrel. Prices are currently lower but our belief is that prices over the medium term are likely to be higher.
The oil price shock is occurring against a backdrop of solid and more broadly-based growth in Canada in recent quarters. Outside the energy sector, we are beginning to see the anticipated sequence of increased foreign demand, stronger exports, improved business confidence and investment, and employment growth. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the speed with which this sequence will evolve and how it will be affected by the drop in oil prices. Business investment in the energy-producing sector will decline. Canada’s weaker terms of trade will have an adverse impact on incomes and wealth, reducing domestic demand growth.
Although there is considerable uncertainty around the outlook, the Bank is projecting real GDP growth will slow to about 1 1/2 per cent and the output gap to widen in the first half of 2015. The negative impact of lower oil prices will gradually be mitigated by a stronger U.S. economy, a weaker Canadian dollar, and the Bank’s monetary policy response. The Bank expects Canada’s economy to gradually strengthen in the second half of this year, with real GDP growth averaging 2.1 per cent in 2015 and 2.4 per cent in 2016. The economy is expected to return to full capacity around the end of 2016, a little later than was expected in October.
Weaker oil prices will pull down the inflation profile. Total CPI inflation is projected to be temporarily below the inflation-control range during 2015, moving back up to target the following year. Underlying inflation will ease in the near term but then return gradually to 2 per cent over the projection horizon.
The oil price shock increases both downside risks to the inflation profile and financial stability risks. The Bank’s policy action is intended to provide insurance against these risks, support the sectoral adjustment needed to strengthen investment and growth, and bring the Canadian economy back to full capacity and inflation to target within the projection horizon.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 4 March 2015. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the Monetary Policy Report on 15 April 2015."
Bank of Canada publishes results of consultation on bank note design principles,2014-12-16,"The Bank of Canada today published a summary of the comments it received in an online consultation on the principles guiding the design of the country’s bank notes.
The consultation, which took place from 8 October to 10 November, offered Canadians an unprecedented opportunity to participate in the design of future bank note series by sharing their views on the Bank’s Principles for Bank Note Design. The summary of comments, which was prepared by Pollara Strategic Insights, is available on the Bank’s website.
Of the nearly 2,000 Canadians who participated, about 80 per cent said they support the principles the Bank put forward. There was considerable interest in how bank notes reflect Canada and many respondents said greater emphasis should be put on representing gender equality, multiculturalism and aboriginal culture. Others said bank notes should show iconic Canadian activities and achievements, landscapes and famous Canadians.
The Bank wishes to thank all those who contributed their ideas. The Bank will carefully consider the results of this consultation when it begins work on future series of bank notes.
The Bank is committed to including input from Canadians at every stage of the bank note design process. It recently invited Canadians to propose ideas until 8 January for a commemorative bank note marking the 150th anniversary of Confederation."
Bank of Canada says household imbalances remain most important risk to financial stability,2014-12-10,"Risks to Canada’s financial system have not increased in the past six months, but high consumer debt loads and imbalances in the housing market remain a concern, the Bank of Canada said today in itsbiannual Financial System Review (FSR).
“We judge that the probability of an adverse shock has eased since our June FSR,” said Governor Stephen S. Poloz. “This mitigates our observation that some financial vulnerabilities appear to be edging higher, leaving our overall assessment of financial stability risk roughly the same as in June.”
While the FSR highlights risks, it is important to remember that global regulatory reform continues to enhance financial resilience in Canada and around the world. Further progress has been made in the past year.
The FSR discusses three important vulnerabilities in the financial system:
The FSR framework also identifies important risks to financial stability that could expose these vulnerabilities should the risks materialize. The most important risk is the inability of stretched households to service their debt should they face a sharp decline in their incomes or a sharp rise in interest rates, which could trigger a correction in house prices. The probability of this happening is low, but if it did, the effect on the economy would be severe. The Bank maintains its assessment of this risk as elevated, but continues to expect a soft landing in the housing market as the global economy gathers strength and interest rates normalize.
Another risk identified in the FSR is that a sudden shift in market expectations about U.S. monetary policy leads to a spike in global term premiums and long-term interest rates that would be transmitted to Canada through financial markets. In addition, a significant stress event in the euro area could trigger a financial crisis that feeds back to the real economy. Finally, there could be a serious financial disruption in China that causes Chinese and global economic growth to slow significantly. These four key risks to the Canadian financial system are the same as those outlined in June, as is the level of severity assigned to them.
“We are also monitoring other emerging vulnerabilities and risks to the global economic outlook, including the continued weakness in oil and other commodity prices that could cause financial stress in some economies,” Governor Poloz said.
The Bank of Canada actively fosters a stable and efficient financial system as part of its commitment to promote the economic and financial welfare of Canada. Economic stability and financial stability are interrelated, and the Bank considers the risks to both in an integrated fashion.
The Bank’s risk-assessment framework is not intended to predict the most likely outcomes for the financial system, but to help Canadians better understand the forces at work in the economy. The framework focuses explicitly on the vulnerabilities in the Canadian financial system and how they are evolving. The vulnerabilities, and their interactions, determine the severity of the impact in the event that a particular risk is triggered. The main financial stability risks are then assessed according to their probability and potential impact.
The December 2014 FSR also contains two reports summarizing recent work by Bank of Canada staff on specific financial sector policies:"
Bank of Canada invites Canadians to propose design ideas for a bank note marking Canada’s 150th anniversary,2014-12-05,"The Bank of Canada is inviting Canadians to propose ideas for the design of a new bank note to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Confederation in 2017.
As announced earlier by Minister of Finance Joe Oliver, the commemorative bank note will be broadly available by 1 July 2017. Details on the denomination, the number of notes that will circulate and the means to obtain them will be made public closer to the issue date.
Canadians can contribute to this special anniversary project by visiting a dedicated webpage and providing ideas about what would best represent Canada’s 150th as well as how these can best be depicted in images on a commemorative bank note. The survey will run until 8 January.
The Bank will be consulting the public and various stakeholders over the coming months in order to ensure that a full range of options are considered prior to submitting the bank note design concepts to the Minister of Finance for approval.
Since it was founded, the Bank of Canada has issued two commemorative bank notes: a special $1 note celebrated Canada’s 100th anniversary in 1967 and a commemorative $25 note was issued in 1935 in honour of the Silver Jubilee of King George V."
Bank of Canada announces signing of reciprocal 3-year Canadian- dollar/renminbi bilateral swap arrangement,2014-11-08,"As part of the initiative announced today by the Government of Canada to promote increased trade and investment between Canada and China, as well as to support domestic financial stability should market conditions warrant, Governor Stephen S. Poloz and Governor Zhou Xiaochuan of the People’s Bank of China have signed an agreement establishing a reciprocal 3-year, Canadian-dollar (Can$)/renminbi (RMB) currency swap line.
The maximum value of the swap is RMB 200 billion, with a reciprocal maximum value of Can$30 billon. 
The Bank of Canada has also signed a memorandum of understanding with the People’s Bank of China to establish a regular dialogue on the conduct of renminbi business and on renminbi liquidity conditions in Canada, and to support the establishment of a renminbi clearing bank in Canada."
Bank of Canada invites Canadians to comment  on bank note design principles,2014-10-08,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is inviting Canadians to comment on the principles that guide the design of the country’s bank notes.
The consultation, which will take place until 10 November, is a way for Canadians to contribute in an unprecedented way to the design of future bank note series. Canadians can participate in an online survey by visiting our Principles for Bank Note Design web page. The Bank will publish a summary of the comments received before the end of the year.
The consultation stems from a review the Bank conducted for the process used to select, develop and design the visual content for the Polymer series of bank notes. The review concluded that Canadians should have increased participation in the design process for the next series.
The Bank wants to include Canadians’ input at every stage of the design process. This consultation seeks to solidify the foundation upon which the visual content - theme, subject matter and images - will be developed in the future.
The Bank will also benefit from Canadians’ ideas on how images can respect these principles.
When the Bank begins work on the next series, it will again seek input from Canadians."
Bank of Canada Calls for Nominations for the 2015 Fellowship and Governor’s Awards,2014-09-19,"The Bank of Canada is calling for nominations under its Fellowship Program for 2015. This program fosters excellence in research in Canada, and develops partnerships with experts outside of the Bank.
Canadian universities are invited to nominate exceptional academics for the two prestigious research awards available through this program: the Fellowship Award and the Governor’s Award.
The Bank of Canada promotes the economic and financial welfare of Canada through its activities in four main areas: monetary policy, currency, the financial system and funds management.  The recent experience of the financial crisis and its aftermath has shown that issues related to central banking go beyond traditional monetary policy theory. The Bank therefore wishes to encourage applications from candidates across a broad range of fields.
The Fellowship Award provides financial support for a term of up to five years to professors in tenure or tenure-track positions at a Canadian university who are widely recognized for their expertise and excellence in areas important to the Bank’s mandate, and whose leading-edge research contributes to the development of knowledge and research capabilities in those areas.
The Governor’s Award provides funding for a term of up to two years to exceptional assistant and associate professors at a Canadian university who have demonstrated the potential to make exemplary research contributions in fields supporting the Bank’s mandate. Candidates must have obtained a PhD within ten years of applying for the award.
Nominations for these awards must be submitted by Friday, 14 November 2014. For more information on the Fellowship Program, award requirements and the nomination process, please visit the Bank’s website or call 613 782-8888."
Bank of Canada Announces the Recipient of its 2014 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence,2014-08-26,"The Bank of Canada is pleased to announce the recipient of its 2014 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence.
This award was established in 2004 to recognize the work of Canadians in the field of law enforcement in deterring and preventing the counterfeiting of Canada’s bank notes.
This year, the Bank is honouring Mr. Bruce Macdonald for his remarkable personal initiative in developing and delivering an effective anti-counterfeiting prevention program for criminal justice students. 
As an instructor at the Lethbridge College’s School of Justice Studies program, Mr. Macdonald provides a strong foundation to students from across the country seeking a career in law enforcement. To date, more than a thousand students have taken part in his program.
This is the first time that the award has been given to someone who is not an employee of an accredited police service, underscoring the value the Bank places on education and the importance of a multi-faceted approach to counterfeit deterrence.
“Bruce’s passion for the counterfeit deterrence program and his devotion to his students make him stand out,” said Richard Wall, Chief of the Currency Department. “The Bank of Canada wishes to highlight the important contribution he has made toward ensuring the safety of Canada’s currency.”
Mr. Macdonald was honoured during the annual conference of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police in Victoria, B.C.

Bank of Canada Publishes 2015 Schedule for Policy Interest Rate Announcements and Release of the Monetary Policy Report,2014-07-29,"The Bank of Canada today published its 2015 schedule of the key dates for policy interest rate announcements and release of the quarterly Monetary Policy Report, and reconfirmed the scheduled announcement dates for the remainder of this year.
The scheduled announcement dates from September 2014 through December 2014 are reconfirmed as:
The scheduled announcement dates for 2015 are:
*Monetary Policy Report published
All rate announcements will be made at 10:00 (ET), and the Monetary Policy Report will continue to be published concurrently with the January, April, July and October rate announcements."
"Bank of Canada’s enhanced financial stability framework shows system is robust, housing vulnerabilities remain",2014-06-12,"The Bank of Canada today unveiled an enhanced framework to gauge the evolving risks to financial stability in its semi-annual Financial System Review (FSR), finding that the Canadian financial system is robust but still faces significant vulnerabilities.
“After weighing the risks to financial stability through our improved framework, our level of comfort as policy makers remains roughly what it was six months ago,” said Governor Stephen S. Poloz. “Our analysis shows that household imbalances remain the most important vulnerability and could amplify the impact of external shocks.”
The new FSR framework identifies important vulnerabilities to the financial system. While the Bank continues to see a constructive evolution in housing market imbalances and household credit, valuations are stretched, there is overbuilding in some parts of the housing market, and household indebtedness remains high. The financial system is also exposed to potential external shocks through the country’s economic and financial links with the rest of the world.
In light of these vulnerabilities, the Bank judges that the level of risk associated with a sharp correction in house prices remains elevated. The probability of this risk is low given signs that the housing market is still headed for a soft landing, but the impact on the economy and financial system would be severe should it materialize.
The Bank sees that the risk of financial stress emanating from China and other emerging-market economies has increased since December, while the risk of a renewed euro-area crisis has diminished. A sharp increase in global long term interest rates is the fourth risk highlighted by the Bank.
The Bank of Canada actively fosters a stable and efficient financial system as part of its commitment to promote the economic and financial welfare of Canada. Economic stability and financial stability are interrelated, and the Bank considers the risks to both in an integrated fashion.
The new risk assessment framework is intended to help Canadians better understand the forces at work in the economy. The framework focuses explicitly on the vulnerabilities in the Canadian financial system and how they are evolving. The vulnerabilities, and their interactions, determine the severity of the impact in the event that a particular risk is triggered. The main financial stability risks are then assessed according to their probability and potential impact.
The June FSR also contains three articles summarizing recent work by Bank of Canada staff on specific financial sector policies:"
Bank of Canada announces appointment of Lynn Patterson as Deputy Governor,2014-04-30,"The Board of Directors of the Bank of Canada today announced the appointment of Lynn K. Patterson as Deputy Governor effective 5 May 2014. Ms. Patterson’s appointment fills the vacancy created by the retirement in May of Deputy Governor John Murray.

Together with Governor Poloz and incoming Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins, the four Deputy Governors share responsibility for decisions with respect to monetary policy and financial system stability, and for setting the strategic direction of the Bank."
Bank of Canada announces appointment of Carolyn Wilkins as Senior Deputy Governor,2014-04-11,"The Board of Directors of the Bank of Canada today announced that Carolyn Wilkins has been appointed Senior Deputy Governor for a term of seven years beginning 2 May 2014. The selection was made by the independent members of the Bank’s Board and was approved by the federal Cabinet.  Ms. Wilkins, who joined the Bank in 2001, is currently Adviser to Governor Stephen S. Poloz. In this capacity, she is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s policy and research work on the Canadian economy, its interaction with the financial system, and monetary policy. She also serves as Secretary to the Bank’s Governing Council, and leads the preparation of the Bank’s quarterly Monetary Policy Reports. Ms. Wilkins replaces Tiff Macklem, who will resign from the Bank on 1 May to become Dean of University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management.  Governor Poloz warmly welcomed Ms. Wilkins to the new role. “I am absolutely delighted with this appointment. Carolyn brings to this role a rich and varied background in monetary policy research, economic forecasting, financial markets and regulatory analysis, and truly exceptional leadership skills. Carolyn will make a tremendous Senior Deputy Governor, and I am thrilled to be working more closely with her,” said Governor Poloz.
As Senior Deputy Governor, Ms. Wilkins will oversee the Bank’s strategic planning and operations and share responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy as a member of the Bank’s Governing Council. She will also be a member of the Bank’s Board of Directors.
“The Board of Directors is proud to appoint Carolyn Wilkins as our new Senior Deputy Governor.

Ms. Wilkins, who was born in Peterborough, Ontario, holds an Honours BA in Economics from Wilfrid Laurier University and an MA in Economics from the University of Western Ontario.
In addition to her roles at the Bank, Ms. Wilkins represents Canada on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and chairs the BCBS Working Group on Liquidity. From 2011 until her appointment as Adviser in 2013, Ms. Wilkins was Chief of the Bank’s Financial Stability Department. Ms. Wilkins also has held a broad range of senior analytical roles at the federal Department of Finance and the Privy Council Office."
Bank of Canada announces appointment of Filipe Dinis as Chief Operating Officer,2014-04-07,"The Bank of Canada today announced that Filipe Dinis has been appointed Chief Operating Officer (COO), effective 5 May 2014.
As the Bank’s first COO, Mr. Dinis will be responsible for managing all of the Bank’s administrative functions. This will include oversight of its corporate administration departments and operational planning.
Mr. Dinis joins the Bank from the federal Privy Council Office, where he is Assistant Secretary to the Cabinet and provides strategic advice and analysis to the Clerk of the Privy Council on Business Transformation and Public Service Renewal. He also serves as Secretary to the Prime Minister’s Advisory Committee on the Public Service. Prior to that position, he served as Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Commissioner at the Canada Revenue Agency.
“We’re very pleased to have Filipe join us in this important role, a new one for the Bank,” said Governor Stephen S. Poloz. “Filipe brings years of experience in strategic planning, managing change, and developing and administering operational plans, all of which will be vital for the Bank as we continue to fulfill our mandate to promote the economic and financial welfare of Canadians.”
The position of COO was created in early 2014 to oversee the Bank’s strategic planning, administrative functions and operations - tasks that previously had been the responsibility of the Senior Deputy Governor. Separating these responsibilities into a COO role will enable the next Senior Deputy Governor to focus more on the conduct of monetary policy as a member of the Bank’s Governing Council, and on fulfilling the Bank's responsibilities for promoting financial stability."
Bank of Canada Announces Recipients of 2014 Fellowship and Governor’s Awards,2014-03-28,"The Bank of Canada today announced that Professor Thomas Lemieux of the University of British Columbia’s Vancouver School of Economics is the recipient of the Bank’s Fellowship Award for 2014.
Professor Lemieux is recognized internationally as an influential labour economist. His current research focuses on exploiting regional variation within countries to answer a number of important questions connected to unemployment and the evolution of wage inequality.
“The Bank of Canada is delighted to present the Fellowship Award to Professor Lemieux, a truly creative researcher and a world leader in the study of labour markets and wage inequality,” said Stephen S. Poloz, Governor of the Bank of Canada. “His name is already a fixture in labour economics textbooks, and his current research agenda will continue to address some of today’s most important and topical issues in economics and public policy.”
The Bank of Canada’s Fellowship Program is designed to encourage leading-edge research and the development of expertise in Canada in a number of areas critical to the Bank’s mandate: macroeconomics, monetary economics and international finance, as well as the economics of financial markets and institutions, including their financial stability.
Each Fellowship Award is for a term of up to five years, subject to an annual review and confirmation by the Bank’s Governing Council. Recipients of this award may apply for a second term.
The Bank of Canada also announced today that Professor Amy Hongfei Sun of Queen’s University is this year’s recipient of the Governor’s Award.
Professor Sun’s primary research interests are in the fields of macroeconomics, monetary and financial economics, and contract theory. Her current research agenda aims to extend and apply broad theoretical frameworks that provide a serious microfoundation for the notion of endogenous liquidity, and therefore allow for the analysis of real-nominal linkages in an internally consistent fashion. She plans to use these frameworks to study real-world issues associated with monetary policy, asset distributions and wealth inequality.
“The Bank is proud to support the work of Professor Sun, whose ability to make exemplary research contributions in the areas of both macro- and microeconomics would be valued by any central bank,” said Governor Poloz. “The issues she is planning on studying clearly match those at the heart of the Bank’s mandate and are of central concern to us.”
The Governor’s Award recognizes outstanding academics at a relatively early stage in their careers who are working at Canadian universities in areas of research critical to the Bank’s mandate. The award is granted for a non-renewable term of up to two years, subject to a review and confirmation by the Bank’s Governing Council in the last quarter of the first year. 
The application deadline for both the 2015 Fellowship and Governor’s awards is 14 November 2014. For more information on the Bank’s Fellowship Program, please visit our website or call 613 782-8888."

Deputy Governor John Murray to Retire from the Bank of Canada,2013-12-23,"The Bank of Canada announced today that Deputy Governor John Murray will retire on 30 April 2014.
John Murray joined the Bank in 1980 and was appointed Deputy Governor in January 2008. In this capacity, he is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s analysis of domestic and international economic developments and, with his colleagues on the Bank's Governing Council, for the conduct of monetary policy. During his career at the Bank, Mr. Murray played a significant role in establishing the theoretical foundations of inflation targeting and helping to refine the way in which it is implemented. He also has been instrumental in forming the Bank’s views on international issues and communicating them in forums such as the G7, the G20, the International Monetary Fund, the Bank for International Settlements, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, forums at which his expertise is highly regarded. Most recently, he has chaired both the OECD’s Working Party 3 and the International Journal of Central Banking. 
Governor Stephen S. Poloz thanked Mr. Murray for his dedication and for all the work accomplished during his tenure at the Bank. “John has provided unwavering, top-notch intellectual leadership to the Bank and its staff - myself included - for more than 30 years,” Governor Poloz said. “His work has had a significant impact on central banking, not only in Canada but at the global level, as his colleagues around the world will readily attest.”
The process to appoint a new Deputy Governor will be undertaken in early 2014."
Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem will leave the Bank in May 2014,2013-12-05,"Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem has announced that he will resign from the Bank of Canada next spring to become Dean of University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management.
Mr. Macklem, who began his career at the Bank in 1984, was appointed Senior Deputy Governor in July 2010, for a term of seven years. He will leave the Bank on 1 May 2014 and assume his new role at Rotman on 1 July for a term of five years.
As Senior Deputy Governor, Mr. Macklem is the Bank's Chief Operating Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of the Bank. The Senior Deputy Governor oversees the Bank’s strategic planning and operations and shares responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy as a member of the Bank’s Governing Council.
“I am very excited by the opportunity to lead this outstanding school of management. I look forward to working with Rotman’s exceptional faculty to shape a new generation of business and public policy leaders and to promote excellent research on the most pressing economic and business issues of our time,” Mr. Macklem said. “I will miss the Bank a great deal. I am extremely proud of the work we have done to promote the economic and financial well-being of Canadians, and I am confident that the Bank’s first-rate research and policy formulation will continue to protect and strengthen Canada’s economy. Governor Poloz, my colleagues on Governing Council, and the Bank’s staff are the most dedicated and talented professionals with whom I’ve had the pleasure to work. Canada’s economy is in good hands.”
Governor Poloz saluted the outstanding contribution that Mr. Macklem has made to the Bank.
""Tiff has dedicated nearly 30 years to the Bank and to Canada, and his influence can be seen in every aspect of our work and in central banking worldwide. I want to thank him for making the Bank better, and especially for his support and mentorship during my first six months as Governor, and I look forward to our continuing close collaboration during the months leading up to his departure.”
The Senior Deputy Governor is appointed by the Directors of the Bank with the approval of the Governor-in-Council (federal Cabinet). A Special Committee of Directors will be formed to launch the selection process for the next Senior Deputy Governor."
Bank of Canada Issues $5 and $10 Polymer Bank Notes,2013-11-07,"The Bank of Canada has announced the entry into circulation of the new $5 and $10 polymer bank notes. Starting today, these final two notes in the new polymer Frontiers series will be available at financial institutions across Canada.
Bank of Canada Governor Stephen S. Poloz launched the $5 note at the Canadian Space Agency in Saint-Hubert, Quebec. He was joined by Chris Hadfield, retired Canadian astronaut and former Commander of the International Space Station. The $10 note was launched at an event held simultaneously at Vancouver’s train station by Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem and VIA Rail Canada President and Chief Executive Officer Marc Laliberté.
“With the introduction of the $5 and $10, we complete the rollout of a series that is at the frontier of bank note technology and sets a global benchmark for bank note security,” said Governor Poloz. “These leading-edge notes are not only hard to counterfeit, but they are also designed to be easy to check. All five denominations in the Frontiers series carry the same security features that help Canadians verify them with ease and ensure that counterfeiting levels in Canada remain very low.”
For the first time since the 1954 series, the Bank of Canada is issuing two notes on the same day. This helps manufacturers, owners and operators of bank note equipment upgrade their machines at a lower cost. The Bank of Canada has been working closely with Canada’s financial sector and the cash-handling industry since 2009 and throughout the launch of this series to support a successful transition to polymer notes.
“Not only are these notes safer, they are also cheaper and greener than the previous series,” said Senior Deputy Governor Macklem. “They last longer than paper notes, which will save millions of dollars, since fewer polymer notes will have to be printed. Fewer notes produced means fewer notes transported and this means a reduced impact on the Canadian environment. Plus, polymer notes will be recycled.”
Chris Hadfield spoke of the significance of featuring Canadian robotics innovations on the new $5 note. “The Canadarm2 and Dextre images on the $5 bank note remind me of the determination, ingenuity and dedication of so many people at the Canadian Space Agency, in the space industry and academia across the country. As Canadians use the new $5 note and see these space symbols, I know they will be reminded of these qualities,” he said.
Marc Laliberté added that VIA Rail is proud that the new $10 note features the Canadian train. “Today is the 128th anniversary of the driving of the last spike that completed the construction of Canada’s railway, and linked the country from sea to sea. So it is only fitting that this new $10 bank note should celebrate the pioneering spirit, and the true grit and determination of Canadians who helped unite our country, with the promise of an even better future.”
The themes of the denominations are:
$100 Medical Innovation - celebrates Canadian innovations in the field of medicine (Portrait: Sir Robert Borden)
$50 CCGS Amundsen, Research Icebreaker - reflects Canada’s commitment to Arctic research and the development and support of northern communities (Portrait: William Lyon Mackenzie King)
$20 The Canadian National Vimy Memorial - evokes the contributions and sacrifices of Canadians in conflicts throughout our history (Portrait: HM Queen Elizabeth II)
$10 The Canadian train - represents Canada’s great engineering feat of linking its eastern and western frontiers by what was, at the time, the longest railway ever built (Portrait: Sir John A. Macdonald)
$5 Canadarm2 and Dextre - symbolizes Canada’s continuing contribution to the international space station program through robotics innovation (Portrait: Sir Wilfrid Laurier)

Bank of Canada Calls for Nominations for the 2014 Fellowship and Governor’s Awards,2013-09-27,"The Bank of Canada is calling for nominations under its Fellowship Program for 2014. This Program fosters excellence in research and analysis in Canada, and develops partnerships with experts outside of the Bank.
Canadian universities are invited to nominate exceptional academics for the two prestigious research awards available through this Program: the Fellowship Award and the Governor’s Award.
The Bank of Canada promotes the economic and financial welfare of Canada through its activities in four main areas: monetary policy, currency, financial system stability and funds management.   The recent experience of the financial crisis and its aftermath has shown that issues related to central banking go beyond traditional monetary policy theory. The Bank therefore wishes to encourage applications from candidates across a broad range of fields.
The Fellowship Award provides financial support for a five-year term to professors in tenure or tenure-track positions at a Canadian university who are widely recognized for their expertise and excellence in areas important to the Bank’s mandate, and whose leading-edge research contributes to the development of knowledge and research capabilities in those areas.
The Governor’s Award provides funding for a two-year term to exceptional assistant and associate professors at a Canadian university who have demonstrated the potential to make exemplary research contributions in fields supporting the Bank’s mandate.  Candidates must have obtained a PhD within ten years of applying for the award.
Nominations for these awards must be submitted by Friday, 15 November 2013. For more information on the Fellowship Program, award requirements and the nomination process, please visit the Bank’s website or call 613 782-8888."
Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity in Canada during April 2013,2013-09-05,"During the month of April, the Bank of Canada and 52 other central banks and monetary authorities conducted a survey of turnover activity in the foreign exchange and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets in their respective countries. This worldwide effort was coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and is undertaken every three years.
The purpose of the survey is to obtain global, comprehensive, and consistent information on the size and structure of the foreign exchange and OTC derivatives markets. The data are collected to increase market transparency and to help central banks, market participants, and others better understand and monitor patterns of activity in global financial markets.
The Bank of Canada is releasing the summary results of its survey today, as are many other participating central banks. As well, the BIS is issuing a press release that summarizes highlights of the aggregated global turnover. 1 Canada has participated in this survey since 1983, and summary results of earlier surveys are shown in Tables 1 through 4 and 7.
Almost all financial institutions in Canada that are active in the wholesale foreign exchange and derivatives markets were surveyed. They consisted of 15 financial institutions, estimated to represent approximately 98 per cent of these markets in Canada. 2 With respect to foreign exchange, the survey covered spot transactions, outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps, currency swaps, 3 and OTC options. The interest rate products covered were forward-rate agreements, interest rate swaps, and OTC options. Participants were also asked to identify transactions by currency and type of counterparty, and, in the case of foreign exchange, they were asked to identify the execution method for each transaction.
The turnover part of the triennial survey is conducted on the basis of residence or location. In particular, the basis for reporting is the country in which the sales desk of a trade is located. 4 Where no sales desk is involved in a deal, the trading desk is used to determine the location. Although there was variation in their individual qualitative assessments, on average, reporting dealers in Canada indicated that turnover activity during the month of April was normal and that activity was increasing compared to the previous six months.
Note:  Additional tables on the results of the Canadian survey, including detailed tables on amounts outstanding, will be made available on the FX Volumes and Rates of the Canadian Foreign Exchange Committee’s (CFEC’s) website later this year.  These will be published after the release of the final comprehensive BIS 2013 Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity report expected before the end of the year. The CFEC’s website will contain a direct link to that report once it is available."
Bank of Canada Announces the Recipients of its 2013 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence,2013-08-20,"The Bank of Canada is pleased to announce the recipients of its 2013 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence.
 Corporal Shelley Olson and Sergeant Johanne Wirsta, from the RCMP’s Federal Serious and Organized Crime Group in Surrey, British Columbia, were honoured during the annual conference of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
 The two veteran police officers were selected for their role in developing and delivering an innovative and highly successful anti-counterfeiting workshop for front-line officers in the Lower Mainland District of British Columbia. It is hoped that this workshop will serve as a model in other RCMP divisions.
 “This year’s recipients provided invaluable training to front-line officers,” said Richard Wall, Chief of the Currency Department. “The Bank of Canada wishes to highlight their important contribution to Canada’s comprehensive deterrence strategy, which has significantly lowered counterfeiting rates over the past decade.”
 The Bank of Canada’s Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence was established in 2004 to recognize the work of Canadian law-enforcement personnel in deterring and preventing the counterfeiting of Canada’s bank notes.

Bank of Canada Unveils New $5 and $10 Polymer Bank Notes,2013-04-30,"Canada’s new and more secure $5 and $10 polymer bank notes were unveiled today at the Bank of Canada’s Ottawa head office, and from aboard the International Space Station. Both of the new notes will begin circulating, at the same time, this November.
Minister of Finance Jim Flaherty, Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney and Paul G. Smith, Chairman of the Board at VIA Rail Canada, were joined via satellite by Canadian Space Agency Astronaut Chris Hadfield, Commander of the International Space Station, to unveil these final two notes in the new Polymer series.
“Canadians can be very proud of their new polymer bank notes,” said Minister Flaherty. “With today’s unveiling of the final two notes in the series, one can see not only the unique story that each of the five denominations tells, but the unifying theme that underlies them all - the profound courage, determination, and ingenuity of our nation and its people.”
The new $5 and $10 notes will carry the same leading-edge security features as the $20, $50 and $100 polymer notes already in circulation. Featuring a sophisticated combination of transparency and holography, this is the most secure bank note series ever issued by the Bank of Canada. The Polymer series is more economical, lasting at least two and half times longer than cotton-based paper bank notes, and will be recycled in Canada.
“The Polymer series notes are at the frontier of bank note technology. The new $5 and $10 bank notes depict the frontiers of our country and our planet,” Governor Carney said. “It is fitting that we are today crossing the final frontier for a world first - the unveiling of a bank note from space.”
While orbiting more than 350 kilometres above Earth, Commander Hadfield gave Canadians their first look at the new $5 polymer note. It features images of Canadarm2 and Dextre - robotics innovations used to build and maintain the Space Station and that symbolize Canada’s ongoing contribution to the international space program.
“I try to inspire young Canadians to aim high. This new $5 bill should do the same,” Commander Hadfield said. “By giving prominence to Canadian achievements in space, this bank note reminds us that not even the sky is the limit.”
The front of the $5 note features a portrait of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Prime Minister of Canada from 1896 to 1911.
VIA Rail Canada’s Paul G. Smith unveiled the new $10 polymer note at the Bank of Canada. The new $10 note features a striking image of The Canadian train journeying through the Rocky Mountains, and represents the enormous feat of engineering that linked Canada’s East and West by rail. A portrait of Sir John A. Macdonald, who was Prime Minister of Canada (1867-1873, 1878-1891) at the time of the railway completion, is featured on the front of the note.
“The transcontinental railway helped build modern Canada. On behalf of VIA Rail, I am delighted that this accomplishment, through the use of this iconic image, has been honoured on the new $10 bank note,” Mr. Smith said. “Not only did the railway contribute to Canada’s economic prosperity by moving people and goods across this vast land, but it also gave Canadians the means to seek new frontiers of their own.""
Over the months leading up to the issuance of these notes in November 2013, the Bank will continue to work closely with financial institutions, manufacturers of bank-note-handling equipment and retailers to ensure a smooth transition. Businesses that use note-handling and processing equipment are encouraged to contact their suppliers about machine compatibility and plans for upgrades.

Bank of Canada designates SwapClear under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act,2013-03-26,"The Governor of the Bank of Canada has designated SwapClear as subject to ongoing regulatory oversight by the Bank under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act (PCSA), effective 2 April 2013.
SwapClear, established in 1999, is the dominant global system for centrally clearing over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps (IRS). It is operated by LCH.Clearnet Limited (LCH), a U.K.-based company that operates a number of central counterparty (CCP) services.
Clearing activity of Canadian institutions in SwapClear has increased substantially, in line with Canada’s G-20 commitment to centrally clear all standardized OTC derivatives. There is potential for further growth, given the decision by Canadian authorities in October 2012 that any CCP that clears OTC derivatives and is recognized by Canadian authorities, including global CCPs, can be used by Canadian market participants, provided that the CCP complies with the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (the Principles) published by CPSS-IOSCO 1 and that the four safeguards identified by the Financial Stability Board are met. 2
The Bank of Canada has determined that SwapClear, an eligible system under the PCSA, 3 has the potential to pose systemic risk to the Canadian financial system because of:
The Minister of Finance has confirmed that he is of the opinion that designation is in the public interest.
“The designation of SwapClear represents a significant milestone towards achieving a safer and more resilient financial system for Canadian participants,” said Governor Mark Carney. “Our involvement in the oversight of SwapClear, to ensure strong risk management prevails, will enable Canada to reap the benefits of the central clearing of OTC interest rate derivatives, as envisioned by the G20.”
Designation brings the system under the formal oversight of the Bank of Canada, which requires all designated systems to comply with the Principles, and provides the Bank with powers to support the system’s ongoing progress toward meeting the four safeguards. Designation also provides the system’s clearing and settlement rules with legal protections under Canadian law, including with respect to netting, finality of payment and finality of settlement. Upon the effective date of designation, the Bank of Canada will fulfill its oversight responsibilities through participation in a multilateral arrangement for oversight co-operation led by SwapClear’s lead regulator, the Bank of England, and through bilateral interaction with the Bank of England and LCH.
Under the PCSA, the Bank of Canada has formal responsibility for the oversight of designated clearing and settlement systems, 4 for the purpose of controlling systemic risk. In this context, systemic risk is defined as the risk that the default of one participant in a clearing and settlement system, or a serious problem arising within the system itself, could lead, through the activities of the system, to the default of other institutions or systems.
Four systems have been previously designated by the Bank: the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS), which clears and settles large-value Canadian-dollar payments; CDSX, which clears and settles securities transactions; CLS Bank, a global system for the settlement of foreign exchange transactions; and the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Service, which centrally clears fixed-income and derivatives contracts.
For further information on the Bank of Canada’s responsibilities for the oversight of clearing and settlement systems in Canada, please visit the Bank's website."
Bank of Canada Announces Recipients of 2013 Fellowship and Governor’s Awards,2013-03-25,"The Bank of Canada today announced that Professor Peter Christoffersen of the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management is the recipient of the Bank’s Fellowship Award for 2013.
Professor Christoffersen is an internationally recognized academic, with an outstanding reputation as a leading researcher in the areas of risk management, volatility modelling and financial engineering. His current work focuses on developing a deeper understanding of the dynamics of financial market volatility and their relationship to the real economy, enhancing fundamentals-based stress-testing techniques, and exploring changing cross-country financial linkages.
“The Bank of Canada is very pleased to present this year’s Fellowship Award to Professor Christoffersen,” said Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada. “His ambitious research agenda related to the measurement of systemic risk, structural modelling of household defaults, improvement of stress-testing techniques and the design of optimal risk-management strategies is not only timely and influential, but also highly relevant to global policy-makers.”
The Bank of Canada’s Fellowship Program is designed to encourage leading-edge research and to develop expertise in Canada in a number of areas critical to the Bank’s mandate: macroeconomics, monetary economics and international finance, as well as the economics of financial markets and institutions, including their financial stability.
Each Fellowship Award is for a five-year period, subject to an annual confirmation by the Bank’s Governing Council. Recipients of this award may apply for a second five-year term.
The Bank of Canada also announced today that Professor James MacGee of Western University is this year’s recipient of the Governor’s Award.
Professor MacGee has published leading-edge research in the areas of consumer bankruptcy and household debt dynamics, the Great Depression, and the evolution of consumer debt markets. His current research plans focus on the propagation of international economic shocks, the impact of high levels of consumer debt on the effectiveness of monetary policy, and the sources and consequences of changes in consumer debt markets.
“I am delighted to name Professor MacGee as this year’s recipient of the Governor’s Award,” said Governor Carney. “His innovative work on a range of important issues facing the post-crisis global economy has established him as a leader in his field, and he has distinguished himself through his ability to effectively bridge the worlds of academia and public policy.”
The Governor’s Award recognizes outstanding academics at a relatively early stage in their careers who are working at Canadian universities in areas of research critical to the Bank’s mandate. The award is granted for a two-year, non-renewable term.
The application deadline for both the 2014 Fellowship and Governor’s awards is 15 November 2013. For more information on the Bank’s Fellowship Program, please visit our website or call 613 782-8888."

“It has been a privilege to serve as the eighth Governor of the Bank of Canada.  I am proud of the Bank’s contribution to the resilience of the Canadian economy throughout an unprecedented period of global turmoil.  The Bank is helping to lead the reform of the global financial system.  It is introducing the most sophisticated currency in the world.  And as the Government of Canada’s fiscal agent, it is providing funds management and banking services with the highest reliability and resiliency.”

Bank of Canada Issues $20 Polymer Bank Note,2012-11-07,"The Bank of Canada today announced the entry into circulation of the new $20 polymer bank notes, during an official ceremony at the Canadian War Museum. Starting today, these new notes will gradually become available at financial institutions across Canada.
Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney was joined at the event by Minister of Finance Jim Flaherty, Minister of Veterans Affairs Steven Blaney, and David Houghton, President of the Vimy Foundation.
“The introduction of the $20 note is an important milestone for the new Polymer series. Making up half of all bank notes in circulation, the $20 note is the most used denomination,” said Governor Carney. “Our safer, cheaper, greener polymer notes will soon be part of Canadians’ daily lives.

The front of the new $20 note features a portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, while the imagery on the back of the note features the Canadian National Vimy Memorial. This iconic monument, located in Vimy, France, commemorates the 1917 Victory at Vimy Ridge and honours Canadians who fought and gave their lives in the First World War in France and who have no known grave.
“It is fitting that we are launching these new notes at the Canadian War Museum only a few days before Remembrance Day. These new notes pay tribute to the sacrifices of Canadian men and women who fought to protect Canada and its allies in all military conflicts,” said Minister Flaherty. “They also protect Canadians from the threat of counterfeiting.

Mr. Coyne had a distinguished career in public service, which included the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Central Mortgage Bank, the Foreign Exchange Control Board, the Canadian Embassy in Washington, the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, and the Bank of Canada. He joined the Bank in 1938 and served as its Governor from 1955 until 1961.
During the trying economic and political period in which he governed the Bank, three important and lasting legacies were established - legacies that directly influence the Bank’s monetary policy framework today.
Mr. Coyne firmly believed, when many others did not, that low and stable inflation should be the paramount objective of monetary policy - a principle that has since become the cornerstone of monetary policy frameworks around the world. In addition, he was a strong proponent of a flexible exchange rate regime. As a result, Canada has had one of the longest experiences with a floating currency in the entire world.  Finally, his central role in the controversy between the Bank and the Government of Canada during the “Coyne Affair” of 1961 ultimately led to a critical clarification of both the Bank’s and the government’s responsibilities with respect to the conduct of monetary policy in Canada.
Mr. Coyne’s legacy has profoundly influenced all of us who work at the Bank, and has made it a stronger and more accountable institution. On behalf of the Bank’s Governing Council and all Bank staff, both past and present, I extend our most sincere sympathies to his wife and family."
Bank of Canada Calls for Nominations for the 2013 Fellowship and Governor’s Awards,2012-10-04,"The Bank of Canada is calling for nominations for its Fellowship and Governor’s awards for 2013. Canadian universities are invited to nominate exceptional academics for these prestigious awards.
The Bank of Canada promotes the economic and financial welfare of Canada through its activities in four main areas: monetary policy, currency, financial system stability and funds management. The Bank’s Fellowship Program fosters excellence in research and analysis and develops partnerships with experts outside the Bank.

Bank of Canada Announces the Recipient of its 2012 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence,2012-08-21,"The Bank of Canada is pleased to announce the recipient of its 2012 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence. The RCMP Integrated Counterfeit Enforcement Team, based in Surrey, British Columbia, was honoured for the second consecutive year during the annual conference of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police in Sydney, Nova Scotia.
Accepting the award on the unit’s behalf were Inspector Ian Lawson, the officer in charge of the RCMP’s Commercial Crime Section, and Constable John Shandro, an investigator on the Integrated Counterfeit Enforcement Team.
The thirteen members of the RCMP’s “E” Division were selected for their successful dismantling of a major counterfeit currency operation in Richmond, British Columbia, on 11 December 2011. The investigators acted on a tip regarding the production of counterfeit Canadian $100 bank notes in British Columbia’s Lower Mainland. Investigators were able to identify and arrest four individuals. The investigation resulted in the seizure of nearly $1.2 million in partially completed counterfeit currency.
“This most effective investigation resulted in the shutting down of a major counterfeiting operation before a single note could enter circulation - the best possible outcome,” said Gerry Gaetz, Chief of the Bank of Canada’s Currency Department.  “That this year’s winners also won last year is a tribute to the excellence and dedication that have become the trademarks of this team.”
The Bank of Canada’s Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence was established in 2004 to recognize the work of Canadian law-enforcement personnel in deterring and preventing the counterfeiting of Canada’s bank notes.

Bank of Canada Publishes 2013 Schedule for Policy Interest Rate Announcements and Monetary Policy Report Releases,2012-08-03,"The Bank of Canada today published its 2013 schedule of key policy interest rate announcements and quarterly Monetary Policy Report (MPR) releases, and re-confirmed the scheduled announcement dates for the remainder of this year.
The scheduled announcement dates from September 2012 through December 2012 are re-confirmed as:
All these remaining 2012 rate announcements will continue to be made at 09:00 (ET) and the October Monetary Policy Report will be published at 10:30 (ET) on Wednesday, 24, October 2012.
Starting in January 2013, the Bank of Canada will begin publishing its quarterly Monetary Policy Report concurrently with its January, April, July, and October rate announcements. The standard day for publication of all scheduled rate announcements and MPRs will be Wednesday. A press conference with the Governor and Senior Deputy Governor will continue to take place on the dates when an MPR is published.
The Bank, as always, retains the option of making unscheduled rate announcements at any time in the event of extraordinary circumstances.
Over the past several years, the Bank has streamlined its production processes for the Monetary Policy Report and gradually reduced the interval between the release of the rate decision and the publication of the MPR from two weeks to the current one day. Today’s announcement is the logical conclusion of this process. Publishing the MPR at the same time as the interest rate announcement provides full and immediate context for the rate decision, which improves transparency and helps the Bank explain its monetary policy more effectively.
The scheduled announcement dates for 2013 are:
*- denotes the publication of the Monetary Policy Report.
There will be a single, consistent time of release for all scheduled rate announcements and Monetary Policy Reports. This release time will be determined and announced following consultations with market participants and other stakeholders.

Bank of Canada Unveils New $20 Note Design,2012-05-02,"Minister of Finance Jim Flaherty and Governor Mark Carney today unveiled the new and more secure $20 polymer bank note at the Bank of Canada’s head office, on Wellington Street in Ottawa. To raise public awareness about the new note, the building’s north-east corner now features seven-storey high images of both sides of the polymer $20.
As with the previously issued $50 and $100 polymer bank notes, the main reason for issuing a new $20 is to stay ahead of counterfeiting threats.  The new polymer notes are also more economical and have a smaller environmental footprint.
“The Bank’s goal is to maintain Canadians’ confidence in our money as a secure means of payment,” said Governor Carney after the unveiling ceremony. “This new $20 note fits the bill.”
The front of the polymer $20 features a new portrait of HM Queen Elizabeth II, who is celebrating her Diamond Jubilee this year. The back of the note pays tribute to the contributions and sacrifices of Canadian men and women in all military conflicts, and features the Canadian National Vimy Memorial – an iconic monument located in Vimy, France that commemorates the Battle of Vimy Ridge and honours those who fought and gave their lives in the First World War in France and have no known grave.
On 9 April 1917, all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force united for the first time to take Vimy Ridge in France – a strategically important position that had eluded previous attempts by allied forces between 1914 and 1916.
“The Canadian Corps’ victory at Vimy is often described as Canada’s ‘coming of age’ as a nation,” said Minister Flaherty, “This third note in the Frontier series commemorates the combination of technical innovation, tactical planning and meticulous execution with which Canada breached more than just a military frontier at Vimy Ridge.”
“The Bank is proud to memorialize this pivotal moment in Canadian history and to feature the inspiring Canadian National Vimy Memorial on the new $20 bank note,” said Governor Carney.
The $20 bill, which accounts for over 50 per cent of all bank notes in circulation and is the main note dispensed by automated banking machines (ABMs), will begin circulating in November of this year. To prepare for the new notes, the Bank is working closely with financial institutions and manufacturers of bank note equipment to ensure a smooth transition to polymer. The Bank is also providing authentication training and support materials to law enforcement officers and to cash handlers in retail and financial institutions.
The remaining bank notes in the series – the $5 and $10 – will be issued by the end of 2013. The specific designs and detailed images of these notes will not be released until their official unveiling dates.
The themes of all the polymer denominations are:
$100 Medical Innovation – celebrates Canadian innovations in the field of medicine (Portrait: Sir Robert Borden)
$50 CCGS Amundsen, Research Icebreaker – reflects Canada’s commitment to Arctic research and the development and protection of northern communities (Portrait: William Lyon Mackenzie King)
$20 The   Canadian National Vimy Memorial – evokes the contributions and sacrifices of   Canadian men and women in military conflicts throughout our history.   (Portrait: HM Queen Elizabeth II)
$10 The Canadian train—represents Canada’s great technical feat of linking its eastern and   western frontiers by what was, at the time, the longest railway ever built.   (Portrait: Sir John A. Macdonald)
$5 Canadarm2 and Dextre—symbolizes   Canada’s continuing contribution to the international space program through   robotics innovation. (Portrait: Sir Wilfrid Laurier)

Bank of Canada designates Canadian Derivatives Clearing Service under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act,2012-04-27,"The Governor of the Bank of Canada today designated the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Service (CDCS) as subject to ongoing regulatory oversight by the Bank under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act (PCSA), effective 30 April 2012.
CDCS, operated by the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation (CDCC), provides central counterparty services for derivative contracts traded on the Montréal Exchange, derivative contracts traded over-the-counter via CDCC’s Converge® platform, and certain fixed income securities issued or guaranteed by the Government of Canada. The fixed income central counterparty service commenced operations on 21 February 2012 and is a key initiative to improve infrastructure for Canadian-dollar core funding markets.
“The implementation of the fixed income central counterparty service by CDCC marks significant progress towards ensuring that core funding markets in Canada remain continuously open and that our financial system becomes more resilient to shocks,” said Governor Mark Carney. “The Bank has worked closely with CDCC, the Investment Industry Association of Canada (IIAC), industry participants and fellow regulators throughout the development of this systemically important financial market infrastructure.”
In light of the critical role that the new fixed income service will play in supporting the repurchase agreement (repo) market, the Bank has determined that CDCS has the potential to pose systemic risk, and has therefore designated it under the PCSA.  The Minister of Finance has confirmed that he is of the opinion that designation is in the public interest.
Under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act, the Bank of Canada has formal responsibility for the oversight of designated clearing and settlement systems, for the purpose of controlling systemic risk. 1 In this context, systemic risk is defined as the risk that the default of one participant in a clearing and settlement system, or a serious problem arising within the system itself, could lead, through the activities of the system, to the default of other institutions or systems.
Three systems have been previously designated by the Bank: the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS), which clears and settles large-value Canadian-dollar payments; CDSX, which clears and settles securities transactions; and the Canadian dollar leg of CLS Bank, a global system for the settlement of foreign-exchange transactions.

Bank of Canada Announces Recipients of  2012 Fellowship and Governor’s Awards,2012-04-13,"The Bank of Canada today announced that Professor Jean-Marie Dufour of McGill University is the recipient of the Bank’s Fellowship Award for 2012.
Professor Dufour is one of Canada’s leading econometricians and is internationally recognized for his work on a wide range of topics associated with the analysis of macroeconomic and financial data. He was first awarded the Bank of Canada Research Fellowship in 2007.
“The Bank is delighted to recognize Professor Dufour’s exceptional contributions to econometric methodology and its applications to macroeconomics, finance, economic growth and development,” said Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada. “The Bank is pleased to reaffirm its support for his work by making him a Fellowship recipient for a second time.”
The Bank’s Fellowship Program is designed to encourage leading-edge research and to develop expertise in Canada in a number of areas critical to the Bank’s mandate: macroeconomics, monetary economics and international finance, as well as the economics of financial markets and institutions, including their financial stability.
Each Fellowship Award spans a period of five years, subject to an annual confirmation by the Bank’s Governing Council. Recipients of this award may apply for a second five-year term.
The Bank of Canada also announced today that Professor Francesco Trebbi of the University of British Columbia is this year’s recipient of the Governor’s Award.
“The Bank of Canada is pleased to present this year’s Governor’s Award to Professor Trebbi,” said Governor Carney. “Through his outstanding research, he will continue to contribute important insights to the field of economics during a critical period for the global economy.”
Professor Trebbi has published widely in the areas of housing and banking regulation, political institutions and their design, and the political economy of the 2008–09 crisis. His current research focuses on the political economy dynamics related to the financial crisis, consistency of financial sector regulation and the impact of housing market dynamics on the real economy.
“Professor Trebbi is conducting highly relevant, insightful and original work. The Bank is pleased to recognize his talent and support his important research,” said the Governor.
The Governor’s Award recognizes outstanding academics at a relatively early stage in their careers who are working at Canadian universities in areas of research critical to the Bank of Canada’s mandate. The award is granted for a two-year, non-renewable term.
The application deadline for both the 2013 Fellowship and Governor's Awards is 15 November 2012. For more information on the Fellowship Program and Governor’s Award, please visit our website or call 613 782-8888."
The Bank of Canada Releases Its Annual Report for 2011,2012-04-05,The Bank of Canada’s Annual Report for 2011 was tabled in the House of Commons today. The Report will be available at 12:00 (ET) on the Bank's website .
Bank of Canada Issues $50 Polymer Bank Note,2012-03-26,"Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney today officially announced the new $50 polymer bank note’s entry into circulation, during an event at the Canadian Coast Guard’s Québec port facility. These new notes will be available at financial institutions from coast to coast to coast starting today.
Governor Carney was joined at the event by Shelly Glover, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance; Marc Grégoire, Commissioner of the Canadian Coast Guard; and Louis Fortier, Scientific Director of ArcticNet.
The front of the new $50 note features a portrait of Sir William Lyon Mackenzie King, while the back depicts the Arctic research icebreaker CCGS Amundsen, in port during the ceremony, as well as other imagery that reflects Canada’s commitment to Arctic research and the development and protection of northern communities. Most importantly, the new $50 bill, like the rest of the polymer series, features a unique combination of state-of-the-art security features, making them the most secure bank notes ever issued in Canada.
“Just as the work of scientists on the Amundsen is expanding the frontiers of Arctic research, this new polymer series is expanding the frontiers of bank note technology,” said Governor Carney.
The Governor encouraged Canadians to familiarize themselves with these new features, the most prominent of which are two transparent areas: one that extends from the top to the bottom of the note and contains complex holographic features, and the other in the shape of a maple leaf.
“Counterfeiting rates have been reduced by 90 per cent since 2004. Issuing this new series of bank notes enables us to continue to stay ahead of counterfeiters,” Governor Carney said. “And by regularly checking the leading-edge security features on these new notes, Canadians can help protect themselves from counterfeiting threats,” he added.
Parliamentary Secretary Glover noted that much has been done in recent years to combat counterfeiting and maintain public confidence in Canada’s bank notes, which helps to avoid the detrimental impact that counterfeiting can have on the integrity of an economy.
“These new polymer notes represent an important part of this effort and a significant barrier to counterfeiting. The striking imagery of this new $50 bill reflects Canada's commitment to the North,” said Parliamentary Secretary Glover.
Commissioner Grégoire expanded on the note’s theme, saying, “Canada’s northern frontier has played an important role in the shaping of our national identity. And it is a true honour to have the CCGS Amundsen, Canada’s Arctic research platform, illustrated on the note in this, the 50th anniversary of the Canadian Coast Guard.” He also spoke of how the Canadian Coast Guard’s partnership with ArcticNet provides the global scientific community with unprecedented access to research opportunities in the North.
With the $50 denomination being more frequently used in automated banking machines, Canadians were also reminded that each time a new series of bank notes is issued the equipment that processes and dispenses them may require adjustments or upgrades. The Bank of Canada has worked closely with financial institutions and manufacturers of bank note processing equipment to help them make this transition to polymer.
The $20 note will be issued later this year, with the remaining bank notes in the series – the $5 and $10 notes – to be issued by the end of 2013. The designs and detailed images of these notes will not be released until their official unveiling dates.
The themes of all of the denominations are:
$100 Medical Innovation – celebrates Canadian innovations in the field of medicine (Portrait: Sir Robert Borden)

Bank of Canada Issues $100 Bill – First Canadian Polymer Bank Note,2011-11-14,"The Bank of Canada today began circulating the new $100 bill – Canada’s first polymer bank note. This new note will be available at financial institutions from coast to coast to coast over the next few weeks.
The $100 note features a portrait of Sir Robert Borden, Prime Minister of Canada between 1911 and 1920, on the front and celebrates Canada’s contributions to innovation in the field of medicine on the back. It was officially released into circulation by Governor Mark Carney at an event in Toronto, Ontario, at the MaRS Centre – a hub for public-private sector innovation and collaboration between the business and scientific communities.
Governor Carney was joined at the event by Dr. Ilse Treurnicht, Chief Executive Officer of MaRS Discovery District.
Dr. Treurnicht discussed the importance of creating an environment that encourages and supports innovation in fields such as health care and life sciences. “Such an environment spurs the development of Canadian expertise and sets the stage for Canadian companies to lead the way,” she said. “These companies will, in turn, develop new ideas and technologies that return significant economic and social benefits, not only to Canadians but, through global partnerships, to the world.”
Remarking that the new polymer bank notes are themselves the product of Canadian ingenuity, combined with innovative technologies from around the globe, Governor Carney said the $100 note is an important step toward significantly increasing the security of Canada’s bank notes. “Just as the images on this note depict Canadian achievements at the frontier of medicine, the advanced security features embedded in these new polymer bills are at the frontier of bank note technology,” Governor Carney said. “This will protect Canadians against tomorrow’s counterfeiting threats. As well, these new notes will last at least two-and-a-half times longer than paper notes and will be recycled – saving money and being better for the environment.”
“Safer, cheaper and greener: these new bank notes are a 21st-century achievement in which all Canadians can take pride and place their confidence,” he concluded.
The new polymer bank notes, among the most advanced in the world, contain leading-edge security features that make them difficult to counterfeit but easy to verify; for example, a large transparent area extends from the top to the bottom of the note and contains complex holographic features that can be viewed from both sides.
Since unveiling the polymer bank note series in June 2011, the Bank of Canada has been working closely with financial institutions and the manufacturers of bank note equipment to support a smooth transition to the new notes. Through its regional offices across the country, the Bank has also been working with law enforcement and retailers to ensure that front-line police officers and cash handlers are familiar with the new security features and to encourage the regular authentication of bank notes.
The $50 note, which was also unveiled in June, will be issued in March 2012. The $20 note will begin circulating in late 2012, followed by the $10 and $5 notes by the end of 2013. Detailed images of the notes and information on their designs will be released on their official unveiling dates."
Bank of Canada Releases Background Information on Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target,2006-11-27,"The Bank of Canada today released the document Renewal of the Inflation-Control  Target: Background Information , which describes Canada's experience  with inflation targeting, reports on some key issues bearing on the framework  for conducting monetary policy, and identifies issues warranting further  research.
This release follows the 23 November announcement by the Government of Canada  and the Bank of Canada that the inflation-control target has been renewed for a  period of five years to the end of 2011. Under the agreement, the Bank will  continue to conduct monetary policy aimed at keeping inflation, as measured by  the consumer price index (CPI), at 2 per cent, with a control range of 1 to 3  per cent around this target.
Key elements discussed in the Background Information document  include the following:
Canada's experience with inflation targeting: Since Canada  adopted inflation targets in 1991, total CPI inflation has averaged very close  to 2 per cent, and the variability of inflation has been significantly lower  than was the case in the 15 years before inflation targeting. Success in  reducing inflation, coupled with an explicit commitment to keep inflation low,  stable, and predictable through time, has helped to anchor inflation  expectations to the 2 per cent target. A low-inflation environment has  contributed to sound economic performance and the well-being of Canadians in a  number of important ways. Consumers and businesses have been able to manage  their finances with greater certainty about the future purchasing power of their  savings and income. Nominal interest rates, both short and long term, have been  much lower and more stable. Output growth in the economy has been generally  higher and significantly more stable, while unemployment has been lower and less  variable. The more stable price environment provided by inflation targeting has  also helped the economy adjust to economic shocks, such as the global high-tech  bubble, 9/11, SARS, and the rapid rise in oil prices, allowing businesses and  households to allocate resources more efficiently.
Total inflation and core inflation: The inflation target  will continue to be set in terms of the 12-month increase in the total consumer  price index. This reflects its role as the most commonly used indicator of  inflation in the Canadian economy and the most relevant estimate of the cost of  living for most Canadians. Total CPI inflation, however, is subject to  considerable variability and so is not always the best indicator of the  underlying trend in inflation and, therefore, of where inflation is likely to be  in the future. For this reason, core inflation—which removes volatile price  components—provides a useful guide for the conduct of monetary policy. In the  context of the new inflation agreement, the Bank intends to continue using CPIX  as its preferred measure of core inflation. CPIX strips out eight of the most  volatile components of total CPI, as well as the effect of changes in indirect  taxes on the remaining CPI components. As in the past, the Bank will continue to  look at a range of measures in order to assess the underlying trend of  inflation.
The target time horizon: Based on recent research, the Bank  has concluded that the present policy of bringing inflation back to the 2 per  cent target within six to eight quarters (18 to 24 months) is still appropriate  generally, although specific occasions may arise in which a somewhat shorter or  longer time horizon might be appropriate. For example, the persistence of lower  observed inflation might suggest, in some instances, a shorter time horizon.  Similarly, the longer-lasting nature of some shocks, such as large asset-price  movements could, in some instances, suggest a longer horizon. A full discussion  of the shocks to the Canadian economy, and of the Bank's policy response to  them, will be provided in the Bank's Monetary Policy Reports.
Asset prices and the inflation target: It remains the Bank's  view that no explicit recognition should be given to asset prices in the  inflation-target index, beyond the recognition already accorded the price of  housing services in the CPI. The Bank will focus on the inflation and output  consequences of any economic disturbance, including asset-price shocks, and will  continue to respond in a manner consistent with meeting its long-run inflation  objective. However, as noted above, some flexibility might be required with  regard to the time horizon over which the target is achieved. This might involve  sacrificing something in terms of inflation performance over the usual horizon,  but could lead to greater financial, economic, and inflation stability over a  somewhat longer horizon. If the Bank judged that the time horizon should be  adjusted relative to the usual six to eight quarters, it would communicate the  reasons for the change and how it planned to respond.
Issues warranting further research: While Canada's 15 years  of experience with inflation targeting have been very positive, there remains  the question of whether the specific regime established in the 1990s will  deliver the greatest contribution to economic performance and to the well-being  of Canadians in the decades ahead. With this in mind, the Bank plans to lead a  concerted research program to learn from our experience and the experience of  others, and to examine whether and how the monetary policy framework in Canada  might be improved. Building on recent research on inflation-targeting  frameworks, the research program led by the Bank will focus on the potential  costs and benefits of targeting a lower rate of inflation or of pursuing a  price-level target instead of an inflation target. The research program will  also consider any necessary reassessment of issues covered in the past and  assessment of any new issues that may arise. Other interested researchers are  invited to join the effort. The goal is to complete this research well in  advance of the next renewal date in 2011 so as to ensure sufficient time for  open discussion of the results and their implications."
Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney Appointed Chairman of Financial Stability Board,2011-11-04,"Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney has been named Chairman of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The FSB is an international agency dedicated to building a more resilient and efficient global financial system. It coordinates the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies, and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies.
The appointment, for a term of three years, was confirmed by G-20 Leaders at their summit in Cannes, France. “I am honoured to assume this new role,” said Governor Carney. “My appointment reflects the strong reputation of Canada’s financial system and the leading role that Canada has played in helping to develop many of the most important international financial reforms.”
Mr. Carney will remain Governor of the Bank of Canada during his chairmanship of the FSB. He succeeds Mario Draghi, who was Governor of the Bank of Italy during his term as Chairman of the Financial Stability Board and its predecessor, the Financial Stability Forum (FSF). Mr. Draghi became President of the European Central Bank on 1 November 2011.
Governor Carney paid tribute to Mr. Draghi’s significant contributions to the promotion of international financial stability during his chairmanship. “Mario’s tireless dedication as FSB Chairman over the past five years, during the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression, has established the FSB’s central role in the global financial system,” said Governor Carney. “The credibility of the FSB, and the quality and breadth of its work, are testaments to Mario’s vision and leadership. The global financial system is stronger today because of his chairmanship.”
The Governor committed to strengthen further the FSB’s capacity and governance, as mandated by the G-20 Leaders, and to work closely with national authorities and international agencies to monitor the implementation of the G-20’s comprehensive financial reform program.
He added, “I am delighted that Philipp Hildebrand, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, will serve as Vice-Chair of the FSB. I look forward to working closely with Mr. Hildebrand as we continue to advance the FSB’s vital work in building a more resilient and efficient financial system.”
Background note: The Financial Stability Board was established in April 2009 as the successor to the Financial Stability Forum (FSF). The FSF was founded in 1999 by the G-7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors. In November 2008, the Leaders of the G-20 countries called for a larger membership of the FSF. In April 2009, at the G-20 Leaders Summit in London, England, it was announced that an expanded FSF was to be re-established as the Financial Stability Board (FSB) with a broadened mandate to promote financial stability. More information on the Financial Stability Board, including a list of its members, can be found at www.financialstabilityboard.org."

Bank of Canada Announces the Recipient of Its 2011 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence,2011-08-23,"The Bank of Canada is pleased to announce the recipient of its 2011 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence. The RCMP Integrated Counterfeit Enforcement Team in Surrey, British Columbia, was honoured today during the annual conference of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police in Windsor, Ontario.
Accepting the award on the unit’s behalf were Superintendent Lesley Bain, Officer in Charge of “E” Division (British Columbia) Commercial Crime Section, and Sergeant Rick Koop, investigator with the team.
The fourteen members of this Integrated Counterfeit Enforcement Team are being honoured for their outstanding efforts in two major counterfeiting investigations that culminated in the arrests of six people in the Metro Vancouver area suspected of producing and passing about $300,000 in counterfeit bills across Western Canada, at a rate of $30,000 per month.    
“Two years ago, this crime ring was responsible for 80 per cent of all counterfeit notes in B.C. and about a third of all counterfeits in Canada,” said Gerry Gaetz, Chief of the Bank of Canada’s Currency Department, in presenting the award. “These officers successfully dismantled two of the largest counterfeiting operations in B.C. history, which, left unchecked, could have had a detrimental effect on confidence in our currency.”
The award was established in 2004 to recognize the work of Canadian law-enforcement personnel in deterring and preventing the counterfeiting of Canada’s bank notes.

Bank of Canada Unveils Polymer Bank Note Series: Celebrating Canada’s Achievements at the Frontiers of Innovation,2011-06-20,"The Bank of Canada unveiled a new polymer bank note series today at its head office in Ottawa. Information on the polymer material and advanced new security features was released, along with the images and designs of the soon-to-be-issued $100 and $50 bank notes, and the themes for the remaining notes in the series.
Minister of Finance Jim Flaherty and RCMP Commissioner William J. S. Elliott joined Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney for the unveiling ceremony.
Minister Flaherty spoke of the importance of cash as a means of payment in the daily lives of Canadians, adding this is why it is important Canadians see their story reflected in the designs. “These bank notes evoke the country’s spirit of innovation, and their designs celebrate Canada’s achievements at home, around the world and in space,” he said. “Bank notes are cultural touchstones that reflect and celebrate our Canadian experience.”
The $100 note, which is to be issued in November 2011, features images that focus on Canadian innovations in the field of medicine: from pioneering the discovery of insulin to treat diabetes, to the invention of the pacemaker and to the role Canadian researchers have played in mapping the human genetic code. Sir Robert Borden, Prime Minister of Canada between 1911 and 1920, in an updated portrait, remains on the front of the note.
The $50 note, which will be issued in March of 2012, features images of the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Amundsen in the North, reflecting Canada’s leading role in Arctic research. It also evokes the part that Canada’s northern frontier—with its vastness and splendour—has played in shaping our cultural identity. An updated portrait of William Lyon Mackenzie King, the Canadian Prime Minister between 1921 and 1930 and again from 1935 to 1948, is on the front of the note.
The notes will contain a number of unique features that expand the frontiers of bank note security and will make them difficult to counterfeit but easy to check. Most prominent are two transparent areas: the larger area extends from the top to the bottom of the note and contains complex holographic features; the other is in the shape of a maple leaf.
“The Bank’s objective with every new series is to produce a bank note that Canadians can use with the highest confidence,” said Governor Mark Carney. ""The Bank is combining innovative technologies from around the world with Canadian ingenuity to create a unique series of bank notes that is more secure, economic and better for the environment.""
RCMP Commissioner Elliott stated that, “These new and technically innovative notes will go a long way to deter the threat of counterfeiting in coming years.” He added that the RCMP will “continue to work with the Bank of Canada, and our policing partners, to maintain public confidence in Canada’s currency.”
In the next six months, the Bank will focus on raising public awareness of the coming note series. It will also continue to provide information to the cash-handling industry to help prepare the system for polymer notes, and will work to inform retailers, financial institutions and law enforcement agencies about how to check the new security features once the notes enter circulation.
Starting with the $20 note in 2012, the remaining bank notes in the polymer series will be issued by the end of 2013. The themes of the other denominations will be:
The specific designs and detailed images of these notes will not be released until their official unveiling dates.

The Bank of Canada Releases Its Annual Report for 2010,2011-06-09,The Bank of Canada’s Annual Report for 2010 was tabled in the House of Commons today. The Report will be available at 12:00 (ET) on the Bank's website
"Canada Is Adjusting to Global Economic Transformation, Says Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney",2011-05-16,"While Canada’s economy remains relatively well positioned, it is being buffeted by a significant transformation of the global economy, which is driven by a combination of secular trends and cyclical forces, Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said.
“It is a time of great opportunity for Canada, but navigating the cross-currents in the global economy will require boldness and skill,” the Governor said in a speech today to the Canadian Club of Ottawa.
Robust growth in emerging market economies is the result of a combination of spectacular secular trends and powerful cyclical forces, the Governor said. Trends include the urbanization of emerging Asia and the accompanying formation of a massive new middle class. Cyclical forces, such as accommodative monetary policies, capital inflows and credit booms, are also contributing to strong domestic demand.  In contrast, economic growth in advanced economies is listless and will be weighed down in coming years by the legacy of the financial crisis.
The balance between these forces has changed and may change again. “Last fall, the consensus was that a faltering recovery in advanced economies was a greater risk than overheating in emerging markets,” Governor Carney noted. “Today, it is the opposite. Such reversals can be expected to continue.”
The Governor identified three consequences for Canada, and discussed their implications:
The Governor said Canada’s economic flexibility, sound macroeconomic policy and commitment to openness will help address the current global challenges and opportunities. “Canada’s fiscal strength and monetary policy credibility represent crucial advantages that must be preserved.”"
Bank of Canada Announces Recipients of 2011 Fellowship and Governor’s Awards,2011-03-30,"The Bank of Canada today announced that Professors Randall K. Morck of the University of Alberta and Gregor W. Smith of Queen’s University are the recipients of the Bank’s Fellowship Award for 2011. “The Bank of Canada is very pleased to present both Professor Morck and Professor Smith with this year’s Fellowship Awards,” said Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada.
Professor Morck has published widely in the areas of corporate finance, financial system efficiency, political economy and business history. He is a highly renowned expert on corporate governance. His current research focuses on the behaviour of financial institutions, the associated linkages between the financial sector and the macroeconomy, and how these affect monetary policy. “Professor Morck’s innovative research is highly relevant to the Bank’s work in monetary policy and financial stability,” said Governor Carney.
Professor Smith has published widely in the areas of empirical macroeconomics, open-economy macroeconomics and economic history. His current research relates to econometric work on participation decisions, portfolio models and behavioural perspectives on financial decisions. “Professor Smith’s unique application of theory to important policy issues consistently produces results that are prominent and influential, and the Bank is pleased to offer him this award for the second time,” noted the Governor.
The Bank’s Fellowship Program is designed to encourage leading-edge research and to develop expertise in Canada in a number of areas critical to the Bank’s mandate: macroeconomics, monetary economics, international finance, as well as the economics of financial markets and institutions, including their financial stability.
Each Fellowship Award spans a period of five years, subject to an annual confirmation by the Bank’s Governing Council.
The Bank of Canada also announced today that Professor Thorsten Koeppl of Queen’s University is this year’s recipient of the Governor’s Award.
Professor Koeppl’s research focuses on financial markets infrastructure—in particular payment, clearing and settlement systems—macroeconomics and financial markets policy. His current research examines various aspects of the stability of financial markets that operate without formal trading and clearing arrangements, such as over-the-counter markets.
“Professor Koeppl has already contributed important and influential research to both the academic and policy-making communities,” said Governor Carney. “The Bank is delighted to recognize his work and support his ongoing research related to over-the-counter markets, central counterparties and centralized liquidity provision.”
The Bank of Canada Governor’s Award recognizes outstanding academics at a relatively early stage in their careers who are working at Canadian universities in areas of research critical to the Bank’s mandate. The award is granted for a two-year, non-renewable term.
The application deadline for both the 2012 Fellowship and Governor’s Awards is 15 November 2011. For more information on the Fellowship Program and Governor’s Award, please visit our website or call 613 782-8888."
Bank of Canada Announces Further Details on New Series of Polymer Bank Notes,2011-03-10,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it will begin circulating a new $100  polymer bank note in November 2011, with a polymer $50 note to follow in March  2012. The Bank also provided further technical and background information about  the new bank notes. More details on the security features, themes and designs of  these denominations will be unveiled in the spring of 2011. The remaining  denominations – the $20 note, followed by the $10 and $5 notes – will be  unveiled and issued by the end of 2013.
With the introduction of the polymer bank note series, the Bank's main focus  continues to be security. ""Canada's new bank notes will have innovative security  features that are easy to verify,"" said Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of  Canada. ""The leading-edge technology in these notes will expand the frontiers of  bank note security.""
In addition to enhancing security, the new bank note series will be easier to  verify, more economical and have a reduced environmental impact. The Bank of  Canada evaluated a number of options before deciding on a new suite of security  features and on the use of polymer material – which is expected to last at least  2.5 times longer than the current cotton-paper bills.
To prepare for the new notes, the Bank is working closely with financial  institutions and manufacturers of bank note equipment to ensure a smooth  transition to polymer. Law-enforcement agencies and retailers will also be  important partners as the Bank introduces the polymer series. ""With these new  notes, the Bank of Canada will provide Canadians with a durable, high-quality,  secure form of payment that they can use with confidence,"" added Governor  Carney.
More information on the new polymer bank note series can be found in the  attached backgrounder."
Bank of Canada Announces Closure of Optical Security Material Division and Sale of Related Assets,2010-12-08,"The Bank of Canada announced today that it is closing its Optical Security  Material (OSM) division and selling all of its related assets.
The Bank's OSM division manufactures optical security material used in the  production of bank notes and other security documents. Following a strategic  review, the Bank decided to sell its OSM assets and initiated a competitive  tender process.
Fortress Optical Features Ltd., a subsidiary of the Canadian-based Fortress  Paper Ltd., was the successful bidder, and yesterday signed a purchase agreement  for the acquisition of the OSM assets. The transaction is expected to conclude  in January 2011. The Bank retains a royalty-free licence to use the intellectual  property sold to Fortress for Canadian bank note applications. Fortress has  extended offers of employment to affected Bank of Canada staff."
Bank of Canada Announces the Recipients of Its 2010 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence,2010-08-24,"The Bank of Canada is pleased to announce the recipients of its 2010 Law  Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence. The award was  established in 2004 to recognize the work of Canadian law-enforcement personnel  in deterring and preventing the counterfeiting of Canada's bank notes.
This year, the Bank is presenting two awards – one recognizing outstanding  enforcement efforts, and the other recognizing an exceptional contribution in  the area of crime prevention.
RCMP Sergeant Susan MacLean and Corporal Tim Laurence, representing all  members of the Integrated Counterfeit Enforcement Team in Greater Toronto, are  being honoured for their role in dismantling a major counterfeiting operation.  Their efforts resulted in the seizure of $4.2 million in counterfeit Canadian  $20 bank notes before they could be put into circulation.
Sergeant Jean-Marc Michaud, of the Sûreté du Québec in Montréal, is being  honoured for his commitment and dedication to the prevention of counterfeiting  over a career spanning 25 years.
""It is commonly accepted that modern policing involves not only the  detection, but also the prevention of crime. The winners of this year's award  have captured that essence,"" said Gerry Gaetz, Chief of the Currency Department,  ""and the Bank of Canada wishes to congratulate these officers for the very  positive contributions they have made towards maintaining confidence in Canada's  currency.""
The recipients of the Bank of Canada's 2010 Law Enforcement Award of  Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence received their awards during the annual  conference of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police in Edmonton.

Bank of Canada increases overnight rate target to 1/2 per cent and re-establishes normal functioning of the overnight market,2010-06-01,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly raised to 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is kept at 1/4 per cent, thus re-establishing the normal operating band of 50 basis points for the overnight rate.
The global economic recovery is proceeding but is increasingly uneven across countries, with strong momentum in emerging market economies, some consolidation of the recovery in the United States, Japan and other industrialized economies, and the possibility of renewed weakness in Europe. The required rebalancing of global growth has not yet materialized.
In most advanced economies, the recovery remains heavily dependent on monetary and fiscal stimulus. In general, broad forces of household, bank, and sovereign deleveraging will add to the variability, and temper the pace, of global growth. Recent tensions in Europe are likely to result in higher borrowing costs and more rapid tightening of fiscal policy in some countries – an important downside risk identified in the April Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Thus far, the spillover into Canada from events in Europe has been limited to a modest fall in commodity prices and some tightening of financial conditions.
Activity in Canada is unfolding largely as expected. The economy grew by a robust 6.1 per cent in the first quarter, led by housing and consumer spending. Employment growth has resumed. Going forward, household spending is expected to decelerate to a pace more consistent with income growth. The anticipated pickup in business investment will be important for a more balanced recovery.
CPI inflation has been in line with the Bank’s April projections. The outlook for inflation reflects the combined influences of strong domestic demand, slowing wage growth, and overall excess supply.
In this context, the Bank has decided to raise the target for the overnight rate to 1/2 per cent and to re-establish the normal functioning of the overnight market.
This decision still leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in light of the significant excess supply in Canada, the strength of domestic spending, and the uneven global recovery.
Given the considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook, any further reduction of monetary stimulus would have to be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic developments.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 20 July 2010. A full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on 22 July 2010."
Re-Establishment of the Standard Operating Framework for the Implementation of Monetary Policy,2010-06-01,"As part of the Bank of Canada's interest rate decision on 1 June 2010, the Bank  will re-establish the standard operating framework for the implementation of  monetary policy. 1
The key features of this framework are the target for the overnight rate, the  operating band, and settlement-balance management. Effective immediately, the  target for the overnight rate will be the midpoint of the operating band and the  width of the operating band will revert to 50 basis points.
The Bank will conduct Special Purchase and Resale Agreement (SPRA) and Sale  and Repurchase Agreement (SRA) operations as necessary to reinforce the target  for the overnight rate (see Terms and Conditions). The targeted level of settlement balances will be gradually  reduced to the typical level of $25 million according to the following  schedule:
The Overnight Standing Purchase and Resale Agreement (PRA) Facility, under  which Primary Dealers have access to an overnight standing PRA facility at the  Bank rate, will be made a permanent part of the standard operating framework.  Terms and Conditions can be found at https://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/fixed-dates/2009/rate_210409_2.pdf.  This facility was introduced in April 2009 as part of the framework for  implementing monetary policy at the effective lower bound for the overnight  rate. 2"
17th Annual Meetings of Gouverneurs des banques centrales des pays francophones,2010-05-14,"As part of events related to its 75th anniversary, the Bank of Canada hosted the  17th annual meetings of Gouverneurs des banques centrales des pays francophones  in Montréal from 12 to 14 May 2010. In addition to hosting G-7 and G-20 meetings  this year, this forum of central bankers is another example of the spirit of  co-operation and collaboration that Canada brings to the international  community.
An initiative organized by the Banque de France in 1994, the meetings of  Gouverneurs des banques centrales des pays francophones are held annually in one  of the member countries of l'Organisation internationale de la francophonie.  This group is composed of 38 central banks representing 54 sovereign countries  (the CBWAS and BCAS represent 14 sub-Saharan African nations). 1
During these meetings, the governors discuss issues of common interest to  their institutions. This year, the governors’ discussions focused on the theme  of Policy Challenges and the Reform Agenda following the Crisis.
The discussions explored individual countries’ experiences with  crisis-induced stimulus measures, exit strategies, the role of central banks  with respect to system-wide stability, central bank independence, the future of  the international monetary system, and recent economic developments in the  global economy.
The 18th annual meetings will take place in Cambodia in 2011."
The New Bank of Canada Commodity Price Index (BCPI),2010-05-07,"The Bank of Canada today announced the introduction of a new Bank of Canada  commodity price index (BCPI). 1 In order to  produce a more accurate, representative and flexible index, the methodology used  to construct the index has been changed. Instead of using a fixed-weight price  index in which the weights are updated only infrequently, the new BCPI uses a  chain Fisher price index with weights updated on an annual basis. The new Fisher  BCPI includes a broader set of commodities and is updated using recent commodity  production data.
Please note that the new Fisher BCPI replaces the previous fixed-weight  series. It is a weighted index of U.S.-dollar prices of commodities produced in  Canada and sold in world markets.
Since the prices of commodities produced in Canada have important  implications for the performance of the Canadian economy, the interpretation of  developments in commodity markets is critical for the conduct of monetary  policy, and an accurate measure of overall movements in prices is essential.
A key advantage of the new Fisher BCPI is the annual updating of the weights  (based on annual production values), so that the new index produces a more  accurate and more relevant measure of commodity price movements. In addition,  its consistency with the Canadian System of National Accounts (which is also  based on chain Fisher indexes) makes the construction of a volume measure for  Canadian commodity production possible."
Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1/4 per cent; removes conditional commitment,2010-04-20,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is unchanged at 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent.
Global economic growth has been somewhat stronger than projected, with momentum in emerging-market economies increasing noticeably. Exceptional stimulus from monetary and fiscal policies continues to provide important support in many countries. The recovery in the major advanced economies is still expected to be relatively subdued, reflecting ongoing balance sheet adjustments and the gradual withdrawal of fiscal stimulus commencing later this year. Despite recent progress, considerable uncertainty remains about the durability of the global recovery.
In Canada, the economic recovery is proceeding somewhat more rapidly than the Bank had projected in its January Monetary Policy Report (MPR). The profile for growth is more front-loaded than that presented in the January MPR. The Bank now projects that the economy will grow by 3.7 per cent in 2010 before slowing to 3.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.9 per cent in 2012.
This profile reflects stronger near-term global growth, very strong housing activity in Canada, and the Bank’s assessment that policy stimulus resulted in more expenditures being brought forward in late 2009 and early 2010 than expected. At the same time, the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar, Canada’s poor relative productivity performance, and the low absolute level of U.S. demand will continue to act as significant drags on economic activity in Canada. The Bank expects the economy to return to full capacity in the second quarter of 2011.
The outlook for inflation reflects the combined influences of stronger domestic demand, slowing wage growth, and overall excess supply. Core inflation, which has been somewhat firmer than projected in January, is expected to ease slightly in the second quarter of 2010 as the effect of temporary factors dissipates, and to remain near 2 per cent throughout the rest of the projection period. Total CPI inflation is expected to be slightly higher than 2 per cent over the coming year, before returning to the target in the second half of 2011.
In response to the sharp, synchronous global recession, the Bank lowered its target rate rapidly over the course of 2008 and early 2009 to its lowest possible level. With its conditional commitment introduced in April 2009, the Bank also provided exceptional guidance on the likely path of its target rate. This unconventional policy provided considerable additional stimulus during a period of very weak economic conditions and major downside risks to the global and Canadian economies. With recent improvements in the economic outlook, the need for such extraordinary policy is now passing, and it is appropriate to begin to lessen the degree of monetary stimulus. The extent and timing will depend on the outlook for economic activity and inflation, and will be consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target.
In accordance with the removal of the conditional commitment, there will be no additional term Purchase and Resale Agreements issued by the Bank.
A full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on 22 April 2010. The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 1 June 2010."
The Bank of Canada Releases Its Annual Report for 2009,2010-03-31,"The Bank of Canada's Annual Report for 2009 was tabled in the House of Commons  today.

"Two Imperatives to Secure Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Economic Growth, Governor Mark Carney Says",2010-03-24,"While Canada is a country of immense strengths and considerable resilience, its  economy is underperforming relative to its potential, Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney said today in a speech to the Ottawa Economics Association. ""We are  not as productive as we could be. Our potential growth is slowing. Moreover,  this is occurring as the very nature of the global economy in which we have  previously thrived is under threat,"" Governor Carney noted.
The cost of the decline in potential growth could amount to a cumulative loss  of income of almost $30,000 per Canadian over the next decade.
The Governor spelled out two imperatives–one domestic, the other  international–to secure strong, sustainable, and balanced economic growth for  Canada. On the one hand, Canada needs to boost its ""abysmal"" productivity  record. ""While there is always more to do, governments have put in place  conditions for a productivity revival,"" Governor Carney said. ""Business, thus  far, has disappointed.""
Canada's productivity challenge is made more pressing by an international  economic landscape that is changing dramatically. Bank of Canada research  illustrates the substantial gains of implementing the G-20 framework launched  last November in St. Andrews, Scotland, as well as the considerable costs of  disregarding it. Ultimately, securing strong, sustainable, and balanced global  economic growth will require changes in behaviour as well as policy adjustments  on several fronts, Governor Carney said.
The Governor advised that now is not the time for Canada to rest on its  laurels or to take an open global economy for granted. ""The twin challenges of  boosting Canadian productivity and of implementing the G-20 framework globally  are daunting,"" he acknowledged. ""But the gains are considerable.""
Governor Carney stressed that the Bank of Canada is committed to tackling  these important issues. ""We have a broad research agenda on productivity. We are  working with our domestic and international partners to reform the global  financial system. We are active participants in G-20 framework discussions, not  merely because they offer the best outcome for the global economy but also  because they are in Canada's interests,"" he said. In concluding, the Governor  noted that, most fundamentally, the Bank has an unwavering commitment to price  stability."
Bank of Canada Announces Recipients of 2010 Fellowship and Governor's Awards,2010-03-15,"The Bank of Canada today announced that Professor Paul Beaudry  of the University of  British Columbia is the recipient of the Bank's Research  Fellowship for 2010. He was also the recipient of the Bank's Research  Fellowship Award in 2005.
Professor Beaudry has published widely in the areas of macroeconomics, labour  economics, monetary policy, technical change, and growth. His current research  focuses on income distribution and business cycle fluctuations, as well as job  creation and debt-fueled expansion and financial crisis.
""The Bank of Canada is delighted to present Professor Beaudry with the  Fellowship Award for a second time. His work is of particular importance given  the current economic climate and this award acknowledges his impressive and  ongoing contributions to monetary policy research,"" said Mark Carney, Governor  of the Bank of Canada.
The Bank's Fellowship Program is designed to encourage leading-edge research  and to develop expertise in Canada in a number of areas critical to the Bank's  mandate: macroeconomics, monetary economics, international finance, as well as  the economics of financial markets and institutions, including their financial  stability.
Each Fellowship can last for a period of up to five years, subject to an  annual confirmation by the Bank's Governing Council. Including this year's  Fellowship awarded to Professor Beaudry, the Bank has a total of six Fellowship  recipients: Professor Gregor Smith of Queen's University (2006), Professor  Jean-Marie Dufour of the Université de Montréal (2007), Professor Michael  Devereux of the University of British Columbia (2008), Professor Shouyong Shi of  the University of Toronto (2008), and Professor David Andolfatto of Simon Fraser  University (2009).
The Bank of Canada also announced today that Professor Federico Ravenna is this year's  recipient of the Governor's Award.
Professor Ravenna specializes in monetary economics and open economy  macroeconomics. His recent work has focused on labour markets and on optimal  monetary policy. He has been an associate professor at the Institute of Applied  Economics of HEC Montréal since 2009.
""Professor Ravenna has an impressive portfolio of academic and research  accomplishments,"" said Governor Carney. ""The Bank of Canada is pleased to  recognize Professor Ravenna's contribution to research on current macroeconomic  issues.""
The Bank of Canada Governor's Award was launched in September 2007 to  recognize outstanding academics at a relatively early stage in their careers who  are working at Canadian universities in areas of research critical to the Bank's  mandate. The award is granted for a two-year, non-renewable term. Professor  Ravenna joins 2009 laureate, Professor Hafedh Bouakez, as the current Governor's  Award recipient.
The application deadline for both the 2011 Fellowship and Governor's Awards  is 15 November 2010. For more information on the Fellowship Program and  Governor's Award, please visit https://www.bankofcanada.ca/fellowship or call 613 782-8888."
Bank of Canada: 75 Years Today,2010-03-11,"The Bank of Canada today is celebrating the 75th anniversary of the  opening of its doors for business and to mark the occasion, Governor Mark Carney  met with economics students from across Canada. ""The Bank is a learning  organization, with immense responsibilities,"" Governor Carney told the students.  ""Our work is grounded in academia, honed by analysis, and disciplined by an  unrelenting focus on our mandate.""
The response of the Bank to the recent economic crisis rose to the highest  standard that has been set over its history, Governor Carney said at an event  co-hosted by Carleton University and University of Ottawa. ""Guided by  well-researched, policy-based frameworks, the Bank has acted decisively. As a  result, the clarity and credibility of these frameworks has made action more  powerful.""
To illustrate the evolution of the Bank over seven and a half decades,  Governor Carney drew on several significant episodes in history with parallels  to the recent crisis.
""The formidable economic and financial challenges facing Canada today are not  necessarily more intractable than those in the past,"" said Governor Carney,  whose remarks and a question-and-answer session were linked via video with  students from universities across the country.
""However, the speed and scale of information, capital flows, and trade are  radically different,"" the Governor noted. ""The global economy is more  fundamentally interconnected than ever before–and that means the response times  for policy-makers have shortened dramatically. In this environment, the value of  principles-based policy frameworks is supreme.""
An environment, supported by the Bank, in which Canadians can plan for the  future with confidence is the legacy of 75 years of research and discipline, of  learning from its predecessors, and of planning for its successors.
In addition to the students based in Ottawa, post-graduate students at  Université Laval, McGill University, Université du Québec à Montréal, Queen's  University, University of Toronto, Dalhousie University, and University of  British Columbia participated in the video-conference."
Bank of Canada announces retirement of Deputy Governor Pierre Duguay,2010-03-10,"The Bank of Canada today announced that Pierre Duguay, Deputy Governor, will  retire from the Bank on 29 July 2010.
Mr. Duguay joined the Bank in 1973 as an Economic Analyst in the Research  Department. During his career at the Bank he has occupied key roles including  Chief of the Department of Monetary and Financial Analysis, Chief of the  Research Department, and Adviser to the Governor. He was appointed Deputy  Governor in January 2000.
Governor Carney praised Mr. Duguay's longstanding contribution to the Bank,  particularly in the areas of monetary policy, economic theory and modelling,  currency, and financial stability. ""Pierre's precision and extensive experience  have been critical as the Bank developed and honed its projection models and  monetary policy, launched new bank notes and, more recently, helped to develop  international financial system governance principles through the Financial  Stability Board,"" Governor Carney said. ""Pierre's expertise, guidance, and  commitment to clear communication have contributed to many of this institution's  successes over the past 38 years.""
The Bank will soon undertake an internal recruitment process for the Deputy  Governor position that will be vacated when Mr. Duguay retires."
Bank of Canada to Issue New Bank Notes,2010-03-04,"As announced in today's federal budget, in 2011 the Bank of Canada will begin to  issue a new series of bank notes printed on a polymer material. The new notes  will incorporate innovative security features to significantly increase their  protection against counterfeiting.
The polymer material will last longer than the cotton paper currently in use,  resulting in lower overall production costs and reduced environmental  impact."
Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1/4 per cent and reiterates conditional commitment to hold current policy rate until the end of the second quarter of 2010,2009-06-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is unchanged at 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent.
Information received since the Bank's April Monetary Policy Report (MPR) is broadly consistent with the Bank's medium-term outlook for output and inflation in Canada. The economy is undergoing major restructuring in a number of sectors. The already significant output gap will continue to widen through the third quarter, putting downward pressure on inflation. The Bank continues to expect that the global and Canadian recoveries will be more muted than usual.
In recent weeks, financial conditions and commodity prices have improved significantly, and consumer and business confidence have recovered modestly. If the unprecedentedly rapid rise in the Canadian dollar (which reflects a combination of higher commodity prices and generalized weakness in the U.S. currency) proves persistent, it could fully offset these positive factors.
The outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty. While the underlying macroeconomic risks are roughly balanced, the Bank judges that, as a consequence of operating at the effective lower bound, the overall risks to its inflation projection remain tilted slightly to the downside.
Conditional on the outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target.
The Bank retains considerable flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy at low interest rates, consistent with the framework outlined in the April MPR.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 21 July 2009. A full update of the Bank's outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on 23 July 2009."
Bank of Canada announces appointment of Tiff Macklem as Senior Deputy Governor,2010-02-26,"The Board of Directors of the Bank of Canada today announced that Tiff Macklem has been appointed Senior Deputy Governor for a term of seven years beginning 1 July, 2010.

Bank of Canada Announces the Recipient of its 2009 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence,2009-08-11,"The Bank of Canada is pleased to announce the recipient of its 2009 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence. The RCMP's National Anti-Counterfeiting Bureau (NACB) and its staff were honoured today during the annual conference of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Accepting the award on behalf of the NACB were RCMP Assistant Commissioner Peter Henschel – Director General, Forensic Science and Identification Services, and Shawki Elias – NACB Program Manager.
The NACB, a specialized law enforcement service, was selected for its critical behind-the-scenes role in providing essential forensic services and support to front-line law enforcement personnel across Canada. The NACB has built a solid reputation among the law enforcement community for expert analysis, trusted guidance, and professional support in the field of counterfeit and document examination.
""Not only do these individuals perform a valuable service by informing us about the latest counterfeiting techniques and trends, their excellent work ultimately leads to the identification and dismantling of counterfeiting operations and the prosecution of those who perpetrate such crimes,"" said Gerry Gaetz, Chief of the Currency Department at the Bank of Canada. ""The Bank of Canada would like to congratulate the NACB for its important contribution to the investigation, deterrence, and prosecution of currency counterfeiting.""
The Bank of Canada's Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence was established in 2004 to recognize the work of Canadian law-enforcement personnel in deterring and preventing the counterfeiting of Canada's bank notes.

All announcements will continue to be made at 09:00 (ET)."
Bank of Canada releases Monetary Policy Report,2003-04-23,"Since the October 2002 Monetary Policy Report, both core and total CPI  inflation have been well above the 2 per cent inflation target. In this  environment, inflation expectations have edged up.
In view of the domestic inflation situation and the underlying momentum of  domestic demand, the Bank raised its target overnight rate on each of its last  two policy announcement dates by 25 basis points, bringing it to  3.25 per cent.
Economic, financial, and geopolitical uncertainty has figured prominently in  the global economic picture over the past six months. Some of the geopolitical  and financial uncertainty has lifted more recently, and the Bank expects that it  will continue to recede. However, over the near term, a degree of global  economic uncertainty remains, and in Canada there is uncertainty about the  possible economic impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),  particularly in the Greater Toronto Area. Overall, the risks confronting the  world economy now appear to be better balanced compared with last autumn, and by  year-end, business and household confidence levels should be higher.
Economic activity should begin to strengthen towards the end of this year and  through 2004, particularly in North America. In Canada, most of the small amount  of economic slack that is likely to open up during 2003 will have closed by the  end of 2004.
Core inflation is expected to remain near 3 per cent through mid-2003. It is  projected to fall to about 2 per cent by early 2004. Total CPI inflation will  continue to be importantly affected by swings in crude oil prices.
The Bank continues to believe that further reductions in monetary stimulus  will be necessary over time to return inflation to the 2 per cent target and to  sustain output levels close to capacity. The timing and pace of further  increases in policy interest rates will depend on the strength of domestic  demand, the evolution of inflation expectations, and the pace of economic  expansion in the United States and in overseas economies."
"Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 1/4 per cent and, conditional on the inflation outlook, commits to hold current policy rate until the end of the second quarter of 2010",2009-04-21,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to 1/4 per cent, which the Bank judges to be the effective lower bound for that rate. The Bank Rate is correspondingly lowered to 1/2 per cent. The deposit rate - the rate paid on deposits held by financial institutions at the Bank of Canada - is left unchanged at 1/4 per cent and provides the floor for the overnight rate. Details of the Bank's operating framework at the effective lower bound can be found here.
In an environment of continued high uncertainty, the global recession has intensified and become more synchronous since the Bank's January Monetary Policy Report Update, with weaker-than-expected activity in all major economies. Deteriorating credit conditions have spread quickly through trade, financial, and confidence channels. While more aggressive monetary and fiscal policy actions are underway across the G20, measures to stabilize the global financial system have taken longer than expected to enact. As a result, the recession in Canada will be deeper than anticipated, with the economy projected to contract by 3.0 per cent in 2009. The Bank now expects the recovery to be delayed until the fourth quarter and to be more gradual. The economy is projected to grow by 2.5 per cent in 2010 and 4.7 per cent in 2011, and to reach its production capacity in the third quarter of 2011. Given significant restructuring in a number of sectors, potential growth has been revised down. The recovery will be importantly supported by the Bank's accommodative monetary stance.
The Bank expects core inflation to diminish through 2009, gradually returning to the 2 per cent target in the third quarter of 2011 as aggregate supply and demand return to balance. Total CPI inflation is expected to trough at -0.8 per cent in the third quarter of 2009 and return to target in the third quarter of 2011. While the underlying macroeconomic risks to the projection are roughly balanced, the Bank judges that, as a consequence of operating at the effective lower bound, the overall risks to its inflation projection are tilted slightly to the downside.
With monetary policy now operating at the effective lower bound for the overnight policy rate, it is appropriate to provide more explicit guidance than is usual regarding its future path so as to influence rates at longer maturities. Conditional on the outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. The Bank will continue to provide such guidance in its scheduled interest rate announcements as long as the overnight rate is at the effective lower bound.
To reinforce its conditional commitment to maintain the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent, the Bank will roll over a portion of its existing stock of one- and three-month term Purchase and Resale Agreements (PRAs) into six- and twelve-month terms at minimum and maximum bid rates that correspond to the target rate and the Bank Rate, respectively. These longer-term PRAs will be issued according to the schedule released today.
Today's decision to lower the policy rate by 25 basis points brings the cumulative monetary policy easing to 425 basis points since December 2007. It is the Bank's judgment that this cumulative easing, together with the conditional commitment, is the appropriate policy stance to move the economy back to full production capacity and to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target. The Bank retains considerable flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy at low interest rates, consistent with the framework to be outlined in the Bank's Monetary Policy Report on 23 April.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 4 June 2009."
Bank of Canada Appoints Two Advisers,2009-04-09,"The Bank of Canada today announced the appointments of David Wolf to the permanent position of Adviser and Jean Boivin to the rotating role of Special Adviser for the term 2009-2010.

Bank of Canada Announces Recipients of 2009 Fellowship and Governor's Awards,2009-03-18,"The Bank of Canada today announced that Professor David Andolfatto of Simon Fraser University is the recipient of the Bank's Research Fellowship for 2009.
Professor Andolfatto is known for his work on business cycle theory, labour market policy, and the theory of money and banking. His current research focuses on bank sector stability and policies designed to avert major financial crises.
""Professor Andolfatto's outstanding work contributes to excellence in monetary policy research in this country,"" said Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada. ""The Bank is delighted to recognize such a valuable contributor to this field.""
The Bank's Fellowship Program is designed to encourage leading-edge research and to develop expertise in Canada in a number of areas critical to the Bank's mandate: macroeconomics, monetary economics, international finance, as well as the economics of financial markets and institutions, including their financial stability.
Each Fellowship can last for a period of up to five years, subject to an annual confirmation by the Bank's Governing Council. Including this year's Fellowship awarded to Professor Andolfatto, the Bank has a total of six Fellowship recipients: Professor Paul Beaudry of the University of British Columbia (2005), Professor Gregor Smith of Queen's University (2006), Professor Jean-Marie Dufour of the Université de Montréal (2007), Professor Michael Devereux of the University of British Columbia (2008), and Professor Shouyong Shi of the University of Toronto (2008).
The Bank of Canada also announced today that Professor Hafedh Bouakez is this year's recipient of the Governor's Award.
Professor Bouakez, an associate professor at the Institute of Applied Economics at HEC Montréal, is known for his work in the field of macroeconomics and open-economy macroeconomics. His current research focuses on the sources of economic fluctuations and the effects of macroeconomic policies on economic activity and welfare.
""The Bank of Canada is very pleased to present Professor Hafedh Bouakez with this year's Governor's Award,"" said Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada. ""Professor Bouakez, though early in his career, has already shown enormous talent and accomplishment in a field that is of particular interest to the Bank of Canada.""
The Bank of Canada Governor's Award was launched in September 2007 to recognize outstanding academics at a relatively early stage in their careers who are working at Canadian universities in areas of research critical to the Bank's mandate. The award is granted for a two-year, non-renewable term. Professor Bouakez is the second recipient of the Governor's Award, joining the 2008 laureate, Professor Henry Siu.
The application deadline for both the 2010 Fellowship and Governor's Awards is 15 November 2009. For more information on the Fellowship Program and Governor's Award, please visit https://www.bankofcanada.ca/fellowship or call 613 782-8888."
Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target by 1/2 percentage point to 1/2 per cent,2009-03-03,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-half of a percentage point to 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3/4 per cent.
The outlook for the global economy has continued to deteriorate since the Bank's January Monetary Policy Report Update, with weaker-than-expected activity in major economies. The nature of the U.S. recession, with very weak auto and housing sectors, is particularly challenging for Canada.
Stabilization of the global financial system remains a precondition for the global and Canadian economic recoveries. The timely implementation of ambitious plans in some major countries to address toxic assets and recapitalize financial institutions will be critical in this regard.
National accounts data for the fourth quarter of 2008 and other indicators of aggregate demand point to a sharper decline in Canadian economic activity and a larger output gap through the first half of 2009 than projected in January. Potential delays in stabilizing the global financial system, along with larger-than-anticipated confidence and wealth effects on domestic demand, could mean that the output gap will not begin to close until early 2010. These factors imply a slightly lower profile for core inflation than was projected in the January MPRU.
The effects of the recent aggressive monetary and fiscal policy actions in Canada and other major economies will begin to be felt in the second half of this year and will build through 2010. Once the global financial system stabilizes and global growth recovers, the underlying strength of the Canadian economy and financial sector should ensure a more rapid recovery in Canada than in most other industrialized economies.
The Bank's decision to lower its policy rate by 50 basis points today brings the cumulative monetary policy easing to 400 basis points since December 2007. Consistent with returning total CPI inflation to 2 per cent, the target for the overnight rate can be expected to remain at this level or lower at least until there are clear signs that excess supply in the economy is being taken up.
Given the low level of the target for the overnight rate, the Bank is refining the approach it would take to provide additional monetary stimulus, if required, through credit and quantitative easing. In its April Monetary Policy Report, the Bank will outline a framework for the possible use of such measures.
The Bank will continue to monitor carefully economic and financial developments in judging to what extent further monetary stimulus will be required to achieve its 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term.
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 21 April 2009. A full update of the Bank's outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the Monetary Policy Report on 23 April 2009."
Bank of Canada announces Deputy Governor appointment,2004-12-17,"The Board of Directors of the Bank of Canada today announced the appointment of  Tiff Macklem as Deputy Governor of the Bank and a member of the Bank's Governing  Council, effective 29 December. Mr. Macklem's appointment fills the vacancy  created by the departure of Mark Carney.
Mr. Macklem first joined the Bank in 1984 as an economist and subsequently  was appointed to increasingly senior positions, including Assistant Chief of the  Research Department, Research Adviser, and Chief of the Research Department. He  was appointed Adviser to the Governor in August 2003. Born in Montréal, Quebec,  Mr. Macklem earned a Bachelor's degree in economics from Queen's University and  a Master's degree and PhD in economics from the University of Western Ontario.  Mr. Macklem returns to the Bank from an executive interchange at the Department  of Finance. His new responsibilities will include international economic and  financial issues, and their relationship to monetary policy.
Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge welcomed the appointment. ""Mr. Macklem  brings to his role as Deputy Governor an outstanding knowledge of economics and  monetary policy and a deep understanding of the Bank, its work, and its staff.  These strengths will be crucial to the Bank's continuing effort to promote the  economic and financial welfare of Canada,"" Governor Dodge said."
Bank of Canada releases Monetary Policy Report Update,2003-07-17,"The Bank of Canada today released its Update to the April Monetary  Policy Report. The Update reviews economic and financial trends in  the context of Canada's inflation-control strategy.
The July Update highlights a number of unanticipated developments  that have changed the outlook for economic activity and inflation in Canada.
Inflation and inflation expectations have eased, and near-term domestic  activity has been weakened by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an  isolated case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and  weaker-than-expected foreign demand for Canadian products. As well, the  substantial rise in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar  will have a dampening effect on the future growth of demand for Canadian goods  and services. As a result, more slack is developing in the economy than was  previously expected. It now appears that, by the end of this year, core  inflation will fall below the 2 per cent target.
To support growth in domestic demand and aggregate levels of economic  activity, the Bank left its target for the overnight rate unchanged on 3 June,  and lowered it by 25 basis points to 3 per cent on 15 July.
The Bank expects that growth in Canada's economy will strengthen towards the  end of 2003 and through 2004. Growth during 2004 will likely be higher than  previously projected, suggesting that the economic slack that is expected to  develop in 2003 will be largely absorbed by the end of next year.
The Bank will closely monitor the strength of domestic and external demand  with a view to keeping inflation on track to meet the 2 per cent target over the  medium term."
Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target by 1/2 percentage point to 1 per cent,2009-01-20,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-half of a percentage point to 1 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 1 1/4 per cent.
The outlook for the global economy has deteriorated since the Bank's December interest rate announcement, with the intensifying financial crisis spilling over into real economic activity. Heightened uncertainty is undermining business and household confidence worldwide and further eroding domestic demand. Major advanced economies, including Canada's, are now in recession and emerging-market economies are increasingly affected. Energy prices have fallen as a result of substantially weaker global demand.
Stabilization of the global financial system is a precondition for economic recovery. To that end, governments and central banks are taking bold and concerted policy actions. There are signs that these extraordinary measures are starting to gain traction, although it will take some time for financial conditions to normalize. In addition, considerable monetary and fiscal policy stimulus is being provided worldwide.
Canadian exports are down sharply, and domestic demand is shrinking as a result of declines in real income, household wealth, and consumer and business confidence. Canada's economy is projected to contract through mid-2009, with real GDP dropping by 1.2 per cent this year on an annual average basis. As policy actions begin to take hold in Canada and globally, and with support from the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar, real GDP is expected to rebound, growing by 3.8 per cent in 2010.
A wider output gap through 2009 and modest decreases in housing prices should cause core CPI inflation to ease, bottoming at 1.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. Total CPI inflation is expected to dip below zero for two quarters in 2009, reflecting year-on-year drops in energy prices. With inflation expectations well-anchored, total and core inflation should return to the 2 per cent target in the first half of 2011 as the economy returns to potential.
Against this background, the Bank today lowered its policy rate by 50 basis points, bringing the cumulative monetary policy easing to 350 basis points since December 2007. Guided by Canada's inflation-targeting framework, the Bank will continue to monitor carefully economic and financial developments in judging to what extent further monetary stimulus will be required to achieve the 2 per cent target over the medium term. Low, stable, and predictable inflation is the best contribution monetary policy can make to long-term economic growth and financial stability.
A full update of the Bank's outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the Monetary Policy Report Update on 22 January 2009. The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 3 March 2009."
Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target by 3/4 percentage point to 1 1/2 per cent,2008-12-09,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to 1 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 1 3/4 per cent.
The outlook for the world economy has deteriorated significantly and the global recession will be broader and deeper than previously anticipated. Global financial markets remain severely strained. Measures taken by major governments are beginning to encourage credit flows, although it will take some time before conditions in financial markets normalize. In addition, a series of recently announced monetary and fiscal policy actions will also support global economic growth.
While Canada's economy evolved largely as expected during the summer and early autumn, it is now entering a recession as a result of the weakness in global economic activity. The recent declines in terms of trade, real income growth, and confidence are prompting more cautious behaviour by households and businesses.
All of these factors imply a lower profile for core inflation than had been projected at the time of the last Monetary Policy Report in October.
Several factors are helping to counterbalance the negative drag from the global economic and financial developments. The depreciation of the Canadian dollar will continue to provide an important offset to the effects of weaker global demand and lower commodity prices. As well, money markets and overall credit conditions in Canada are responding to significant and ongoing efforts to provide liquidity to the Canadian financial system.
In light of the weakening outlook for growth and inflation, the Bank of Canada lowered its policy interest rate by a total of 75 basis points in October and by an additional 75 basis points today. These monetary policy actions provide timely and significant support to the Canadian economy.
The Bank will continue to monitor carefully economic and financial developments in judging to what extent further monetary stimulus will be required to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 20 January 2009.
A full update of the Bank's outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the Monetary Policy Report Update on 22 January 2009."
Deputy Governor to leave Bank of Canada,2008-11-24,"The Bank of Canada announced today that Deputy Governor Sheryl Kennedy has  decided to leave the Bank to pursue other interests. She will step down from her  position effective 1 December 2008.
The Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mark Carney, expressed his appreciation  for Ms. Kennedy's dedication, leadership and many contributions to the Bank  during her 14-year career as Deputy Governor. ""Sheryl's numerous contributions  to the Bank of Canada range from her responsibilities as a member of the  Executive Management Committee to her work as a member of the Governing Council  in carrying out the Bank's monetary policy and financial stability mandates. She  also served Canada with distinction internationally, including as Chair of the  Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Markets Committee from 2003 -  2006.""
""I will always cherish the dedication to excellence and commitment to public  service shared by my colleagues here at the Bank of Canada and in central banks  around the world. There never is a good time to move on, but after fourteen  years as Deputy Governor, it is time to open a new chapter in my career,"" said  Ms. Kennedy.
The Bank will launch a recruitment process for the Deputy Governor position shortly."
Bank of Canada announces senior appointments in new internal structure,2008-11-03,"In order to hone its focus on a safe and sound financial system, reinforce  research, and streamline management processes, the Bank of Canada has realigned  responsibilities and made a series of senior appointments to lead its work in  monetary policy, financial stability, management of the Government of Canada's  funds, and Canadian bank notes.
The new structure creates more integrated lines of business around these four  functions. It will build synergies needed to tackle complex policy issues  inherent in the Bank's mandate to contribute to rising living standards through  low, stable and predictable inflation and a sound financial system.
The alignment positions the Bank to promote financial stability through  better coordination between its economic and financial analysis and its market  intelligence activities.
The alignment strengthens the links between research and policy issues. With  the alignment of roles, the Bank's strong reputation for policy research will be  complemented by more emphasis on long-term research, consistent with the  findings of a recent external evaluation.
The new structure also adjusts the management of Corporate Administration  activities – such as human and financial resources, IT, physical infrastructure  and communications – to provide more effective support for the four mandated  functions.
The new departments and associated senior officers can be found at the  following link: https://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/about/council.html"
Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 2 1/4 per cent,2008-10-21,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to 2 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 2 1/2 per cent.
Three major interrelated developments are having a profound impact on the Canadian economy. First, the intensification of the global financial crisis has led to severe strains in financial markets. The associated need for the global banking sector to continue to reduce leverage will restrain growth for some time. Second, the global economy appears to be heading into a mild recession, led by a U.S. economy already in recession. Third, there have been sharp declines in many commodity prices. The outlook for growth and inflation in Canada is now more uncertain than usual.
Consistent with the G7 Plan of Action, major economies have announced extraordinary measures to stabilize their financial systems. These initiatives will be pivotal to resuming the flow of credit to support global economic growth. Canada's economy and strong financial system will benefit directly from these actions.
The weaker outlook for global demand will increase the drag on the Canadian economy coming from exports. Lower commodity prices will also dampen the outlook, working through a deterioration in Canada's terms of trade to moderate domestic demand growth. The marked tightening in Canadian credit conditions in recent weeks will restrain business and housing investment. The Bank expects growth to be sluggish through the first quarter of next year, then to pick up over the rest of 2009 and to accelerate to above-potential growth in 2010 supported by improving credit conditions, the lagged effects of monetary policy actions and stronger global growth. The recent sizeable depreciation of the Canadian dollar will also provide an important offset to the effects of weaker global demand and lower commodity prices. Overall, the Bank projects average annual growth in real GDP of 0.6 per cent in both 2008 and 2009, and 3.4 per cent in 2010.
With excess supply projected to build throughout 2009 and lower assumed energy prices, inflationary pressures will ease significantly relative to the projection in the July Monetary Policy Report Update. Core inflation is now projected to remain below 2 per cent until the end of 2010. Total CPI inflation should peak during the third quarter of 2008, fall below 1 per cent in the middle of 2009, and then return to the 2 per cent target by the end of 2010.
In the face of diminished inflationary pressures, the Bank of Canada lowered its policy interest rate by 50 basis points on 8 October, acting in concert with other major central banks. This extraordinary move, combined with today's announcement, brings the cumulative reduction in our target for the overnight rate to 75 basis points since the Bank's last fixed announcement date. These actions provide timely and significant support to the Canadian economy. The cumulative reduction in the Bank's policy rate since last December is now 225 basis points.
In line with the new outlook, some further monetary stimulus will likely be required to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term. The evolution of the financial crisis, its impact on the global economy and the timing of the effects of the various extraordinary measures being taken to address it pose significant risks to the projection on both the upside and the downside.
The Bank will publish the details of its new projection for the economy and inflation, including all the key risks to the projection, in the Monetary Policy Report on 23 October 2008.
Information note:
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 9 December 2008."
Counterfeit $100 bills circulating in the Greater Montréal Area,2008-09-15,"The Bank of Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Sûreté du Québec, and  the Service de Police de la Ville de Montréal are warning the public that  counterfeit $100 notes of the latest bank note series (the series  that features a metallic stripe) are circulating in the Greater Montréal  Area.
""Cash handlers and the public can easily detect these bogus bills by  verifying the security features found on bank notes,"" said Gerry Gaetz, Chief of  Banking Operations at the Bank of Canada. ""This recent increase in counterfeit  $100 bills serves as a reminder to stay vigilant.""
Prevention and detection are essential in the fight against counterfeiting.  Police are encouraging consumers, cash handlers, and retailers to familiarize  themselves with the security features on bank notes to protect themselves and  keep counterfeits out of circulation.
Possession of counterfeit notes is a criminal offence. Citizens are asked to  contact their local police service or the office of the regional coordinator of  the RCMP Counterfeit Program at 514 939-8319 to share any information that they  might have.
To learn more about bank note verification, please see the attached Quick Tips. The Bank of Canada provides free training  materials on counterfeit detection and is currently setting up information  kiosks in the Greater Montréal Area. For more information, please call 1 888  513-8212."
Bank of Canada issues statement on recent market developments,2008-09-15,"The Bank of Canada is closely monitoring global market developments. The Bank  welcomes the initiatives of the Federal Reserve System to provide support to  U.S. financial markets.
The Bank will provide liquidity as required to support the stability of the  Canadian financial system and the functioning of financial markets."
Bank of Canada keeps overnight rate target at 3 per cent,2008-06-10,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 3 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 3 1/4 per cent.
Since the April Monetary Policy Report (MPR), economic developments have been broadly in line with expectations. However, the balance of risks to the Bank's April projection for inflation in Canada has shifted slightly to the upside. Although the composition of U.S. growth has not been favourable for demand for Canadian goods and services, overall, global growth has been stronger and commodity prices have been sharply higher than expected. At the same time, many of the downside risks to inflation identified in the April MPR have eased, while the evolution of credit conditions has been in line with expectations. The risk remains that potential growth will be weaker than assumed.
With the decline in first-quarter GDP, the Canadian economy is judged to have moved into excess supply, which is expected to increase this year. Consistent with the April MPR, the Bank continues to project that economic growth will pick up this year and accelerate in 2009, owing in part to a firming of U.S. demand and accommodative monetary policy in Canada.
If current levels of energy prices persist, total CPI inflation will rise above 3 per cent later this year. However, with the Canadian economy operating in excess supply, core inflation is expected to remain below 2 per cent through 2009. Both total and core inflation should converge on 2 per cent in 2010 as the economy returns to balance.
Against this backdrop, the Bank now judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriately accommodative to bring aggregate demand and supply into balance and to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target. There continue to be important downside and upside risks to inflation in Canada, which the Bank will monitor closely.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 15 July 2008. The Bank will publish an updated projection for the economy and inflation, and its assessment of the risks, in the Monetary Policy Report Update on 17 July 2008."
Bank of Canada Announces the Recipients of its 2008 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence,2008-08-26,"The Bank of Canada is pleased to announce the recipients of its 2008 Law  Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence. Corporal Tim  Laurence, Corporal Susan MacLean, and now-retired Staff Sergeant Ken MacDonald  of the Integrated Counterfeit Enforcement Team, RCMP Toronto West, were honoured  today during the annual conference of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of  Police in Montréal, Quebec.
The recipients of the Award of Excellence were selected for their persistence  and commitment to an investigation code-named Project Ophir, which  resulted in the shutting down of the largest counterfeiting operation in  Canadian history. The investigation focused on a highly organized and  sophisticated group of criminals that was determined to be the source of over $6  million in counterfeit bank notes. Following the investigation, eight persons  were charged and have since entered guilty pleas to various counterfeiting  offences.
""Thanks, in large part, to the efforts of law-enforcement personnel across  Canada and, specifically, the individuals we are honouring today, counterfeiting  rates have fallen dramatically in Canada in the last four years,"" said Pierre  Duguay, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada. ""The Bank of Canada congratulates  these officers for the very positive contribution they have made towards  maintaining confidence in Canada's currency.""
The Bank of Canada's Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit  Deterrence was established in 2004 to recognize the work of Canadian  law-enforcement personnel in deterring and preventing the counterfeiting of  Canada's bank notes.

Counterfeit $100 notes discovered: Bank of Canada and the Toronto Police Service remind the public and retailers to be vigilant,2008-04-28,"The Bank of Canada and the Toronto Police Service are reminding the public and  retailers to pay close attention to the bank notes they receive. A number of  counterfeit $100 notes have been passed mainly in the Greater Toronto Area in  the last few weeks.
""This incident reminds us that we must always remain vigilant against  counterfeiting,"" said Gerry Gaetz, Chief of Banking Operations at the Bank of  Canada. ""Counterfeiting rates in Canada have declined by over 75 per cent since  their peak in 2004, but counterfeiters look for opportunities to pass notes  where they can tell people aren't checking them.""
These $100 counterfeits can be easily detected when compared with a note that  you know is genuine. As always, we are advising retailers and the public to  check two or more security features.
All denominations in the latest bank note series (those with the metallic  stripe) have the same security features. Once you know how to check the features  on one note, you know how to check any denomination. It takes only minutes to  learn how and just seconds to check your money. Checking cash is a quick and  reliable deterrent to counterfeiting.

Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target by 1/2 percentage point to 3 per cent,2008-04-22,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-half of a percentage point to 3 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3 1/4 per cent.
Growth in the global economy has weakened, reflecting the effects of a sharp slowdown in the U.S. economy and ongoing dislocations in global financial markets. Growth in the Canadian economy has also moderated as buoyant growth in domestic demand, supported by high employment levels and improved terms of trade, has been substantially offset by the fall in net exports. While both total and core CPI inflation were running at about 1.5 per cent at the end of the first quarter, the underlying trend of inflation is judged to be about 2 per cent, consistent with an economy that was operating just above its production capacity.
The Bank is now projecting a deeper and more protracted slowdown in the U.S. economy. This has direct consequences for the Canadian economic outlook, with declining exports projected to exert a significant drag on growth in 2008. In addition, tightening credit conditions and softening sentiment are expected to moderate business investment and consumer spending. Nevertheless, domestic demand is projected to remain strong, supported by firm commodity prices, high employment levels, and the effect of cumulative easing in monetary policy.
The Bank projects that the Canadian economy will grow by 1.4 per cent this year, 2.4 per cent in 2009, and 3.3 per cent in 2010. Consistent with this growth profile, the economy moves into excess supply in the second quarter of 2008, and spare capacity continues to increase through early next year. However, a gradual recovery in the U.S. economy, a return to more normal credit conditions, and accommodative monetary policy should generate above-potential growth and bring the economy back into balance around mid-2010.
The recent price-level adjustments for automobiles and the effect of past changes in indirect taxes will keep measured inflation below target through 2008. The emergence of excess supply in the economy should keep downward pressure on inflation through 2009. Both core and total inflation are projected to move up to 2 per cent in 2010, as the economy moves back into balance. There are both upside and downside risks to the Bank's new projection for inflation; these risks appear to be balanced.
In line with this outlook, some further monetary stimulus will likely be required to achieve the inflation target over the medium term. Given the cumulative reduction in the target for the overnight rate of 150 basis points since December, the timing of any further monetary stimulus will depend on the evolution of the global economy and domestic demand, and their impact on inflation in Canada.
A full analysis of economic and financial developments, trends, and risks will be set out in the Bank's Monetary Policy Report, to be published on 24 April 2008.
The Bank's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 10 June 2008."
Bank of Canada Announces Recipients of Fellowship Award for 2008,2008-03-18,"The Bank of Canada today announced that Professor Michael Devereux of the  University of British Columbia and Professor Shouyong Shi of the University of Toronto are the recipients of the Bank's  Research Fellowship for 2008.

The Bank of Canada Releases Its Annual Report for 2007,2008-03-14,"The Bank of Canada's Annual Report for 2007 was tabled in the House of Commons  today.
Copies of the Report will be available at 12:00 (ET):"
Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target by 1/2 percentage point to 3 1/2 per cent,2008-03-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-half of one percentage point to 3 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3 3/4 per cent.
Information received since the January Monetary Policy Report Update (MPRU) indicates that economic growth in Canada through the four quarters of 2007 was broadly in line with expectations. Domestic demand has remained buoyant, as rising commodity prices and high employment have continued to support income growth. Canada's net exports weakened further in the fourth quarter, reflecting the slowing U.S. economy and the impact of the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar. Overall, the Canadian economy remained above its production capacity at year-end. Core and total CPI inflation – at 1.4 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively, in January – have also been consistent with the Bank's expectations.
At the same time, there are clear signs that the U.S. economy is likely to experience a deeper and more prolonged slowdown than had been projected in January. This stems from further weakening in the residential housing market, which is adversely affecting other sectors of the U.S. economy and contributing to further tightening in credit conditions. The deterioration in economic and financial conditions in the United States can be expected to have significant spillover effects on the global economy. These developments suggest that important downside risks to Canada's economic outlook that were identified in the MPRU are materializing and, in some respects, intensifying.
The Bank now judges that the balance of risks around its January projection for inflation has clearly shifted to the downside, and, as a result, the Bank is lowering the target for the overnight rate. Further monetary stimulus is likely to be required in the near term to keep aggregate supply and demand in balance and to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term.
The Bank will publish a new projection for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the Monetary Policy Report on 24 April 2008.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 22 April 2008."
Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 4 per cent,2008-01-22,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 4 1/4 per cent.
In the second half of 2007, the Canadian economy grew broadly in line with the Bank's expectations in the October Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Despite some slowing in growth in the fourth quarter, the Canadian economy continues to operate above its production capacity. Both core and total CPI inflation have been lower than projected in the MPR, largely reflecting a price-level adjustment related to increased competitive pressures in the retail sector stemming from the level of the Canadian dollar.
Financial market conditions have deteriorated since October, leading to a tightening of credit conditions in industrial countries. Given this, and a deeper, more prolonged decline in the U.S. residential housing sector, the 2008 outlook for the U.S. economy is now significantly weaker than at the time of the October MPR.
For Canada, the effects of the weaker U.S. economic outlook will lead to additional downward pressure on export growth. However, despite tighter credit conditions, domestic demand in Canada is projected to remain strong. This strength is supported by continued income growth associated with the increase in commodity prices since October, which has led to further gains in our terms of trade. Overall, the Bank now projects weaker growth in 2008 than was expected in October, with the economy moving into modest excess supply in the second quarter of this year. Somewhat stronger growth in 2009 brings the Canadian economy back into balance in early 2010. The inflation projection has also been revised down since October, especially for 2008, primarily reflecting the price-level adjustment noted above and the recent one-percentage-point cut in the GST. Both core and total CPI inflation should fall below 1 1/2 per cent by the middle of this year before returning to the 2 per cent target by the end of 2009. On the whole, the Bank judges that the risks to this inflation projection are roughly balanced.
In line with this outlook, the Bank has decided to lower the target for the overnight rate and further monetary stimulus is likely to be required in the near term to keep aggregate supply and demand in balance and to return inflation to target over the medium term.
The Bank's detailed projection for the economy and inflation, and risks to the projection, will be published in the Monetary Policy Report Update on 24 January 2008.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 4 March 2008."
Nominations Invited for the Bank of Canada's Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence,2004-12-01,"Effective today, the Bank of Canada is inviting nominations for the second  annual Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence. This  award is presented to one or more police officers, employees, or volunteers of a  Canadian law enforcement agency who have demonstrated outstanding commitment and  initiative in the fight against bank note counterfeiting or in the prevention of  counterfeiting. Nominations may be submitted by any serving member of a Canadian  law enforcement agency.
The Bank of Canada, in collaboration with the Canadian Association of Chiefs  of Police (CACP), established the Award of Excellence in March 2004 to recognize  the efforts of Canadian law enforcement in deterring bank note  counterfeiting.
In 2004, three members of the Toronto Police Service received the award for  their work on ""Project Greenback,"" which resulted in the seizure of  approximately $3 million in counterfeit bank notes, as well as the dismantling  of multiple counterfeit production facilities in the Toronto area.
The three recipients of the first award—Detective Carmine Palermo, Detective  Constable Thomas Hancock, and Detective Constable Harjit Sangha—were honoured at  the 2004 CACP conference in Vancouver. The next recipients will be honoured at  the 2005 CACP conference to be held in Ottawa in August. Each recipient will  receive an award, presented by a member of the Bank of Canada's Governing  Council, and their names will be inscribed on the master award that will be  permanently displayed in a public area at the Bank's head office in Ottawa.
Award recipients are chosen by a selection committee comprising three  representatives from the Bank of Canada, and two from the CACP.
Nominations for the 2005 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit  Deterrence must be received at the Bank of Canada by 31 March 2005.

Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 4 1/4 per cent,2007-12-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 4 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 4 1/2 per cent.
Since the October Monetary Policy Report (MPR), there have been a number of economic and financial developments that have a bearing on the prospects for output and inflation in Canada.
Consistent with the outlook in the MPR, the global economic expansion has remained robust and commodity prices have continued to be strong. The Canadian economy has been growing broadly in line with the Bank's expectations, reflecting in large part underlying strength in domestic demand. However, both total CPI inflation and core inflation in October, at 2.4 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively, were below the Bank's expectations, reflecting increased competitive pressures related to the level of the Canadian dollar. The Bank now expects inflation over the next several months to be lower than was projected in the MPR. In the context of exceptional volatility in global financial markets, the Canadian dollar spiked well above parity with the U.S. dollar in November, but it has recently traded closer to the 98-cent-U.S. level assumed in the October MPR.
Overall, the Canadian economy continues to operate above its production capacity. Given the strength of domestic demand and weak productivity growth, there continue to be upside risks to the Bank's inflation projection.
However, other developments since October suggest that the downside risks to the Bank's inflation projection have increased. Global financial market difficulties related to the valuation of structured products and anticipated losses on U.S. sub-prime mortgages have worsened since mid-October, and are expected to persist for a longer period of time. In these circumstances, bank funding costs have increased globally and in Canada, and credit conditions have tightened further. There is an increased risk to the prospects for demand for Canadian exports as the outlook for the U.S. economy, and in particular the U.S. housing sector, has weakened.
All these factors considered, the Bank judges that there has been a shift to the downside in the balance of risks around its October projection for inflation through 2009. In light of this shift, the Bank has decided to lower the target for the overnight rate. At its next interest rate decision in January, the Bank will assess all economic and financial developments and the balance of risks. A full projection for the economy and inflation will be published in the Monetary Policy Report Update on 24 January 2008.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 22 January 2008."
Bank of Canada keeps target for the overnight rate at 4 1/2 per cent,2007-09-05,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 4 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 4 3/4 per cent.
Near-term prospects for economic growth outside North America appear to be slightly stronger than anticipated in the July Monetary Policy Report Update (MPRU), while near-term economic prospects for the United States are weaker than expected. It now seems likely that the adjustment in the U.S. residential housing sector will be more pronounced and protracted, exacerbated by recent developments in financial markets. On balance, this implies weaker demand for Canadian exports than had been expected at the time of the July MPRU.
In Canada, total and core CPI inflation in July, at 2.2 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively, continued to be above the inflation target but generally in line with the Bank's expectations. The Canadian dollar has also largely traded in the range assumed in the July MPRU. At the same time, the pace of economic growth in the first half of this year was above the Bank's expectations. It now appears that the Canadian economy is operating further above its production potential than was estimated in July. Domestic demand remains robust, buoyed by a continuing strong labour market and higher-than-expected increases in home sales and prices. However, recent developments in financial markets have led to some tightening of credit conditions for Canadian borrowers, which should temper growth in domestic demand.
Against this background, the Bank judges that the current level of the target for the overnight rate is appropriate. However, there are significant upside and downside risks to the outlook for inflation. On the upside, there is a possibility that household demand in Canada could be stronger than anticipated, while on the downside the ongoing adjustment in the U.S. housing sector could be more severe and spill over to the U.S. economy more broadly. In addition, there is uncertainty about the extent and duration of the tightening of credit conditions in Canada and, hence, about the tempering effect this will have on growth in domestic demand.
The Bank will continue to closely monitor evolving economic and financial developments. A full update of the Bank's outlook for growth and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be set out in the Monetary Policy Report, to be published on 18 October 2007.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 16 October 2007."

New initiative to involve Canadian high school students in the fight against bank note counterfeiting crimes,2007-09-10,"The Bank of Canada, the Durham District School Board, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Ontario Provincial Police and the Sûreté du Québec are joining forces to promote the new Counterfeit Detection module, a free ready-to-teach kit available to high schools across the country. Their common goal is to raise awareness among Canadian high school students about the detrimental impact of bank note counterfeiting and to involve them in the fight against this harmful criminal activity.
This initiative has been well received by the Canadian education community. ""The Durham District School Board is pleased to partner with the Bank of Canada and all levels of law enforcement to offer students an important and effective learning opportunity on the issue of counterfeit bank notes,"" said Craig Burch, Director of Education at the Durham District School Board, where the program was developed and where the counterfeit detection and prevention unit was first taught in Canada. ""Education professionals are strongly encouraged to contact the Bank of Canada to get more information about this effective program that has drawn an enthusiastic response by both students and educators.""
Many high school students currently work or will pursue a career in the retail sector, where most counterfeit bank notes are passed. Reaching them is a great way to encourage counterfeit prevention.
""The new Counterfeit Detection teaching kit will provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to authenticate bank notes and help prevent financial losses for themselves or their employers,"" said Pierre Duguay, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada. ""These skills will be valued by potential employers and will actively contribute to reducing counterfeiting rates in Canada.""

Bank of Canada Announces the Recipients of its 2007 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence,2007-08-23,"The Bank of Canada is pleased to announce the recipients of its 2007 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence. Acting Detective Brian Wintermute and Detective Tom Warfield, and Constables Steve Poplawski, Scott Besco, and David Bauer of the Peel Regional Police Service in Ontario were honoured yesterday during the annual conference of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police in Calgary, Alberta.
The recipients of the Award of Excellence were selected for their relentless efforts and innovative investigative techniques in a major investigation dubbed Project More Money. The tireless work of these officers led to the shutdown of a significant counterfeiting operation, the arrest of 30 suspects on 469 criminal charges, and the seizure of sophisticated printing equipment that was linked to many counterfeit $20 and $50 notes circulated in Canada during 2005 and 2006.
The Bank of Canada's annual Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence was established in 2004 to recognize the work of Canadian law-enforcement personnel in deterring and preventing the counterfeiting of Canada's bank notes. ""Counterfeiting erodes confidence in the money we use every day and can undermine the economic health of our country if left unchecked,"" said Gerry Gaetz, Chief of the Bank's Department of Banking Operations. ""That is why the Bank strongly supports Canada's law-enforcement authorities in the fight against counterfeiting and is proud to honour the tremendous contribution of this year's award winners.""

Bank of Canada sees joint commitment by major Bank CEOs on bank-sponsored asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) as positive step,2007-08-21,"The Bank of Canada continues to monitor the functioning of Canada's financial markets and to make liquidity available as required. The commitment by Canada's major bank CEO's to work together to support the performance and liquidity of the market for bank-sponsored asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) is a further positive step to help re-establish well functioning money markets in Canada.

The agreement announced this morning by major investors and liquidity providers to pursue an orderly restructuring of the Canadian market for structured finance asset-backed commercial paper (third party ABCP) provides an opportunity for parties to work through the many complex issues related to the market for asset-backed commercial paper. The commitment by institutions to take actions in support of an orderly resolution is very helpful. The Bank also welcomes the confirmation by Canada's major chartered banks that they are supporting their own bank-sponsored asset-backed commercial paper programs. Together, these initiatives should help support the functioning of financial markets in Canada."

Bank of Canada raises overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 4 1/2 per cent,2007-07-10,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 4 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 4 3/4 per cent.
Economic growth and inflation in Canada in the first half of this year have been stronger than expected in the April Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Final domestic demand has remained the key driver of economic growth in Canada, bolstered by firm commodity prices. The Bank judges that the economy is now operating further above its production potential than was projected at the time of the April MPR. Both total CPI and core inflation have been higher than projected in April and are above the 2 per cent inflation target. Longer-term interest rates have increased and the Canadian dollar has appreciated sharply, moving well above the trading range assumed in the last MPR.
The Canadian economy is now projected to grow by 2.5 per cent in 2007, somewhat stronger than was expected in April, and to grow somewhat more slowly in 2008 and 2009 than previously projected. In this new projection, higher interest rates across the yield curve and a higher assumed range for the Canadian dollar of 93 to 95.5 cents U.S. act to moderate growth in 2008 and 2009 to an average of about 2 1/2 per cent. This brings aggregate demand and supply in Canada back into balance in 2009.
Inflation is projected to be slightly higher and more persistent than in the April MPR. However, as excess demand diminishes, total CPI and core inflation should decline to 2 per cent by early 2009.
There are both upside and downside risks to the Bank's inflation projection. The main upside risk is that household demand in Canada could be stronger than expected. The main downside risks are related to the higher Canadian dollar and the ongoing adjustment in the U.S. housing sector. In the context of the Bank's new projection, these risks appear to be roughly balanced.
In line with this outlook, the Bank is raising the target for the overnight rate to 4 1/2 per cent. Some modest further increase in the overnight rate may be required to bring inflation back to the target over the medium term.
An analysis of the Bank's outlook for growth and inflation, including economic and financial developments and risks to the projection, will be set out in the Monetary Policy Report Update, to be published on 12 July 2007.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 5 September 2007."
Bank of Canada keeps target for the overnight rate at 4 1/4 per cent,2006-07-11,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 4 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 4 1/2 per cent.
Overall, the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Canada is largely unchanged from the April Monetary Policy Report (MPR).
The global economic expansion remains robust. Growth in Canada in the first half of 2006 appears to have been a little stronger and the Canadian dollar has traded in a somewhat higher range than was envisaged in the April MPR. As well, there was a further shift in the composition of demand towards consumption and away from exports. Total CPI inflation has remained above the 2 per cent target, mainly because of increases in consumer energy prices, while core inflation moved up to 2 per cent slightly sooner than expected. All factors considered, the Canadian economy is currently judged to be operating just above its production capacity.
In 2007 and 2008, growth is projected to be a little weaker than was set out in the April MPR. The additional strength that has developed in domestic demand is expected to persist into next year, but this should be more than offset by a weaker outlook for net exports, owing primarily to the recent strength of the Canadian dollar. With some anticipated moderation in U.S. growth, combined with past interest rate and exchange rate increases, the Canadian economy is projected to return to its production capacity by the end of 2008. Total CPI inflation is expected to average just over 1 1/2 per cent from mid-2006 to mid-2007, with the reduction in the Goods and Services Tax lowering the inflation rate by 0.6 percentage points over this period. Inflation should then return to the 2 per cent target. Core inflation should remain at about 2 per cent throughout the projection period.
In line with the Bank's largely unchanged outlook, the current level of the target for the overnight rate is judged at this time to be consistent with achieving the inflation target over the medium term. The Bank will monitor global and domestic economic and financial developments, including adjustments in the Canadian economy, relative to its projection. Risks to the projection remain roughly balanced, with a small tilt to the downside later in the projection period related to global imbalances.
Further details of the Bank's outlook for output and inflation will be discussed in the Monetary Policy Report Update, to be released on 13 July 2006.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 6 September 2006."

Bank of Canada Issues Upgraded $5 Bank Note,2006-11-15,"The Bank of Canada today put into circulation a $5 note with upgraded security features in order to improve the security of Canadian bank notes. The note will be available across Canada within a few weeks.
The design, colour, and illustrations of the upgraded note remain the same as those of the previously issued $5 notes from the Canadian Journey series.
The upgraded $5 note will include the now-familiar set of improved security features found on all other notes in the Canadian Journey series. These features include a metallic holographic stripe, a watermark portrait, a windowed colour-shifting thread woven into the paper, and a see-through number. To increase its durability, the upgraded $5 note is printed on a slightly heavier paper and is coated with a protective varnish.
""The high level of security now found on the $5 bank note will make it harder than ever to counterfeit,"" said RCMP Inspector Barry Baxter, Officer in Charge, Counterfeit and Identity Fraud. ""Nonetheless, it is important that Canadians check their bank notes. Not only to protect themselves, but to make it harder for criminals to pass counterfeit money.""

Governor Dodge Looks at the Global Economy and the Implications for Ontario,2006-10-25,"In a speech by video conference to the Ontario Economic Leadership Summit in  Niagara-on-the-Lake, Governor Dodge reviewed the Bank's projections contained in  the Monetary Policy Report, published last week. Global economic growth  is expected to be a little higher than previously anticipated, but a weaker  near-term outlook for the U.S. economy has curbed the near-term prospects for  Canadian exports and growth, the Governor said. The Bank's base-case projection  now calls for average annual GDP growth of 2.8 per cent in 2006, 2.5 per cent in  2007, and a return to 2.8 per cent in 2008.
Governor Dodge pointed out that Ontario's economy will be affected more than  the national average because of the close ties between the province's industrial  base and the two sectors of the U.S. economy that are slowing the most:  automobiles and housing. ""Nevertheless, modest growth in Ontario's economy  should persist,"" Governor Dodge said. ""Seventy per cent of Ontario's economic  activity comes from the service sector, and that sector remains in good  shape.""
The Governor went on to address some of the longer-term structural challenges  facing Ontario, as well as some of the policies that will be important to secure  Ontario's economic future. In particular, the Governor stressed the need for  sound policies on the development of human resources and ongoing improvements in  the province's infrastructure."
Bank of Canada Announces the Recipients of its 2006 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence,2006-08-24,"The Bank of Canada is pleased to announce the recipients of its 2006 Law  Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence. Sergeant Mary  Kostashuk from the RCMP ""E"" Division Commercial Crime Section in British  Columbia and Constable Kurtis Bosnell from the Upper Fraser Valley Regional  Detachment of the RCMP were honoured yesterday during the annual conference of  the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police in St. John's, Newfoundland and  Labrador.
The recipients of the Award of Excellence were selected for their foresight,  teamwork, and meticulous attention to detail in a counterfeiting investigation  that led to the prosecution and conviction of Ryan Alexander Grozell, the leader  of a significant counterfeit production and distribution ring.
The joint efforts of Sergeant Kostashuk and Constable Bosnell shut down an  operation that had been responsible for producing more than $1.8 million in  counterfeit notes in Western Canada since 2003. Grozell, the target of their  investigation, pleaded guilty to numerous charges related to counterfeiting and  received a substantial jail sentence.
The Bank of Canada's annual Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for  Counterfeit Deterrence was established in 2004 to recognize the work of Canadian  law-enforcement personnel in deterring and preventing the counterfeiting of  Canada's bank notes. ""We believe that it is vital to deter activities that  undermine the confidence of Canadians in their currency,"" said Pierre Duguay,  the Bank's Deputy Governor responsible for the issuance of bank notes.

Bank of Canada raises overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 4 1/4 per cent,2006-05-24,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 4 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 4 1/2 per cent.
The strong momentum in the global and Canadian economies has continued, although there has recently been an increased degree of volatility in commodity markets, foreign exchange markets, and financial markets more generally. Recent Canadian data confirm that domestic demand remains solid, and that both CPI and core inflation are evolving largely in line with the Bank's expectations.
With today's increase, the target for the overnight rate is now at a level that is expected to keep the Canadian economy on the base-case path projected in the April Monetary Policy Report (MPR) and to return inflation to the 2 per cent target. The Bank will monitor global and domestic economic and financial developments, including adjustments in the Canadian economy, relative to the projection set out in the MPR. The Bank continues to assess the risks to this projection to be as presented in the MPR.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 11 July 2006. The Monetary Policy Report Update will be published on 13 July 2006."
Bank of Canada raises overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 4 per cent,2006-04-25,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 4 1/4 per cent.
The global economy has been growing at a robust pace, exhibiting a little more momentum than had been anticipated. This global strength and the associated higher prices of many commodities, together with strong domestic demand in Canada, have produced solid growth in the Canadian economy at a pace consistent with the Bank's outlook in the January Monetary Policy Report Update. At the same time, global competition and the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar continue to pose challenges for a number of sectors of the economy. All factors considered, the Canadian economy is judged to be operating at, or just above, its production capacity. High energy prices have kept total CPI inflation in Canada somewhat above the Bank's 2 per cent target. Core inflation has remained below 2 per cent owing to persistent downward pressure from prices of imported consumer goods. Against this backdrop, the Bank decided to raise its target for the overnight rate.
Looking forward, the Bank projects that the Canadian economy will grow by 3.1 per cent in 2006, 3.0 per cent in 2007, and 2.9 per cent in 2008. Total CPI inflation is projected to average close to 2 per cent in 2007 and 2008 (excluding the effect of any changes in the GST). The Bank judges that the risks to its projection are roughly balanced, with a small tilt to the downside later in the projection period.
In line with the Bank's outlook for the Canadian economy, some modest further increase in the policy interest rate may be required to keep aggregate supply and demand in balance and inflation on target over the medium term. The Bank will closely monitor evolving developments in the Canadian economy in light of the cumulative increase in the policy interest rate since last September. A full analysis of economic developments, trends, and risks will be provided in the Monetary Policy Report, to be published on 27 April 2006.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 24 May 2006."
Bank of Canada Reassures Canada Savings Bond Payroll Savings Program Clients Following Successful Fraud Investigation,2006-04-07,"The Bank of Canada today expressed its satisfaction with the successful  investigation by the RCMP and the Ottawa Police Service of an incidence of  fraudulent activity related to a small number of Canada Savings Bond Payroll  Savings Program accounts. The police investigation culminated in arrests  announced today.
""We are confident that the privacy breach was limited to 16 accounts and the  incidence of fraud was limited to 8 of those accounts, totalling approximately  $100,000,"" said Dale Fleck, Chief of the Bank's Debt Administration Office. ""The  affected customers have been contacted and advised of the security breach, and  those who were the victims of fraudulent redemptions have had their accounts  reimbursed."" Canada Savings Bonds are guaranteed by the Government of  Canada.
In December 2005, the Bank of Canada was made aware by its third party  supplier, EDS Canada Inc., of a problem with the accounts of a small number of  Payroll Savings Program customers. The Bank and EDS subsequently informed the  RCMP and took action to protect the integrity of the accounts that may have been  involved. The police undertook an investigation, with the full cooperation of  the Bank and EDS. The owners of potentially affected accounts were contacted.  The Bank informed the Privacy Commissioner about the situation.
""The Bank and EDS are working together to review safeguards to protect the  integrity and security of Canada Savings Bond Payroll Savings Program accounts,""  Mr. Fleck said. ""We have strengthened all procedures and are continuing to see  where further safeguards can be implemented.""
While the Bank of Canada believes the number of exposed accounts is contained  to 16, any concerned customers are advised to review their recent Annual  Statement of Holdings. If any information appears inaccurate, they are advised  to contact the Canada Savings Bond Payroll Savings Program toll-free number at  1-877-899-3599 or visit www.mybonds.gc.ca.

Bank of Canada to Upgrade $5 Bank Note,2006-04-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it will issue a $5 note with upgraded security features beginning 15 November 2006 as part of its ongoing effort to improve the security of Canadian bank notes.
The upgraded $5 will include the same security features as the other denominations in the Canadian Journey series, making it easier for consumers and cash handlers to detect counterfeits. These features include a metallic holographic stripe, a watermark portrait, a windowed colour-shifting thread woven into the paper, a see-through number, and enhanced fluorescence under ultraviolet lighting. The design, colour, and theme of the upgraded note will remain the same as those on previously issued $5 notes from the Canadian Journey series.
The Bank is collaborating with its partners to ensure the smooth introduction of the upgraded $5 note into circulation. The Bank will provide manufacturers of note-handling equipment—such as automated banking machines (ABMs), change makers, and automated ticket dispensers—with the necessary information to make the required adjustments to their equipment before the notes are circulated.
The Bank will also work closely with financial institutions to replace older $5 notes in circulation with the upgraded $5 notes. This will ensure that Canadians have the more secure notes as quickly as possible to reduce opportunities for counterfeiters. Older versions of the $5 note will, however, remain legal tender.
Consumers and retailers can protect themselves from loss and reduce opportunities for counterfeiters by regularly checking their bank notes. Retailers are the first line of defense in the fight against counterfeiting. By knowing how to quickly and reliably identify genuine bank notes, they can help keep counterfeits out of circulation. In a similar manner, consumers can protect themselves by checking the notes they receive in change.

Bank of Canada Announces Research Fellowship for 2006,2006-03-10,"The Bank of Canada today announced that Professor Gregor Smith of Queen's University is the recipient of the Bank's Research  Fellowship for 2006.
Professor Smith, one of the leading contributors to the Canadian economics  community, has earned international recognition for his work in empirical  macroeconomics, open-economy macroeconomics, and economic history.
""Professor Smith is an outstanding economist who continues to make an  important contribution to leading-edge research,"" said David Dodge, Governor of  the Bank of Canada. ""The Bank is proud to support an economist of his calibre  who has had such a far-reaching impact as a researcher, teacher, and leader in  the field of economics in Canada.""
The Bank's Fellowship Program is designed to encourage leading-edge research  and to develop expertise in Canada in a number of areas critical to the Bank's  mandate: macroeconomics, monetary economics, international finance, as well as  the economics of financial markets and institutions, including their stability.
In 2003, the first year of the program, the Bank granted Fellowships to  Professor Michael Devereux of the University of British Columbia and Professor  Shouyong Shi of the University of Toronto. Professor René Garcia of the  Université de Montréal was the 2004 Fellowship recipient, and Professor  Paul Beaudry of the University of British Columbia was the 2005 recipient. The  Bank plans to award an additional Fellowship next year, for a total of six  Fellowships by the end of 2007.

Bank of Canada raises overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 3 3/4 per cent,2006-03-07,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 3 3/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 4 per cent.
Information on the Canadian and global economies received since the January Monetary Policy Report Update has been broadly in line with the Bank's expectations, although the Canadian dollar has recently moved above the range that had been assumed in the Update. Real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 2.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2005, as the Bank had projected, and both CPI and core inflation have also come in as expected. Overall, indications are that the Canadian economy is continuing to operate at its full production capacity.
Recent data do not alter the Bank's outlook for growth and inflation, including its assessment of risks, as set out in the January Update. Consistent with this view, some modest further increase in the policy interest rate may be required to keep aggregate supply and demand in balance and inflation on target over the medium term. The Bank will provide a full analysis of economic developments, trends, and risks in the next Monetary Policy Report, to be published on 27 April 2006.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 25 April 2006."
Bank of Canada raises overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 3 1/2 per cent,2006-01-24,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 3 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 3 3/4 per cent.
Information received since the last interest rate announcement on 6 December indicates that the Canadian and global economies are evolving essentially in line with the Bank's expectations as set out in the October Monetary Policy Report (MPR). The Canadian economy continues to adjust to global developments and to the associated changes in relative prices. CPI inflation, at 2.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2005, was lower than expected primarily because of lower gasoline prices. As anticipated, core inflation remained stable at 1.6 per cent. The level of economic activity at year end was close to expectations.
The outlook for growth and inflation in Canada is similar to that in the October MPR. The Bank continues to judge that the Canadian economy is operating at its production capacity and will grow roughly in line with production potential through 2007. CPI and core inflation should return to the 2 per cent target by the first half of 2007. Risks to the Bank's projection remain balanced for 2006 and tilted to the downside through 2007 and beyond. Further details of the Bank's outlook for output and inflation will be discussed in the Monetary Policy Report Update, to be released on 26 January 2006.
In line with the Bank's base-case projection and current assessment of risks, some modest further increase in the policy interest rate would be required to keep aggregate supply and demand in balance and inflation on target over the medium term.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 7 March 2006."
Bank of Canada raises overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 3 1/4 per cent,2003-04-15,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 3 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 3 1/2 per cent.
Since the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 4 March, both core and total CPI inflation have remained well above the Bank's 2 per cent inflation target and measures of inflation expectations have edged up. Economic growth in Canada in the second half of 2002 and in early 2003 eased from its earlier vigorous pace, but domestic demand has remained firm and employment gains have continued. As a result, the level of economic activity in Canada remains near full production capacity.
The near-term outlook for the global and Canadian economies is somewhat weaker than was expected at the time of the Bank's last interest rate announcement. Nonetheless, with geopolitical uncertainties diminishing and world oil prices declining significantly, the risks confronting the global economy are now better balanced. The Bank thus expects that economic expansion in Canada and the United States will begin to strengthen towards the end of 2003 and will strengthen further in 2004. In view of the domestic inflation environment and the expectation that the Canadian economy will be operating near potential in 2004, the Bank has decided to further reduce the amount of monetary stimulus by raising the target for the overnight rate.
In light of near-term economic uncertainties, the Bank will be closely monitoring domestic demand and the inflation environment, as well as the pace of recovery in the United States and the overseas economies. An elaboration of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation will be set out in the Monetary Policy Report, to be published on 23 April 2003.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 3 June 2003."
Bank of Canada Statement on the Nomination of Dr. Ben S. Bernanke as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of the United States,2005-10-24,"The Bank of Canada has been honoured to work with Chairman Alan Greenspan for the past 18 years, and we wish him every success in his future endeavours.
We welcome the nomination of Dr. Ben S. Bernanke as the new Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of the United States. The Bank of Canada has worked closely with Dr. Bernanke in his capacity as a professor at Princeton University and as a member of the Federal Reserve Board."
Bank of Canada raises overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 3 per cent,2003-03-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 3 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 3 1/4 per cent.
Consumer price data since the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 21 January indicate that both core and total CPI inflation remain well above the Bank's 2 per cent inflation target. Persistent above-target inflation rates over the past few months reflect not only the impact of higher-than-expected crude oil and natural gas prices, but also continuing increases in auto insurance premiums and price pressures in certain sectors such as housing, food, and some services. More broadly, as noted in the January 2003 Monetary Policy Report Update, the fact that relative price increases are having a large impact on measures of trend inflation reflects an underlying firmness in the price-setting environment.
Economic growth in Canada moderated in the final three months of 2002, largely because of weaker exports, most notably a decline in automotive shipments to the United States. However, final domestic demand, particularly household expenditure, continued to expand at a robust pace. Owing to upward revisions to measures of Canadian economic growth in previous quarters, the level of economic activity at the end of 2002 was slightly higher than had been expected. Accordingly, the level of economic activity in Canada remains near full production capacity. In these circumstances, the persistence of above-target rates of inflation has elevated the risk of an increase in inflation expectations.
Significant geopolitical and global economic uncertainties continue to overhang the short-run economic outlook. Nonetheless, the Bank continues to expect demand for Canadian output to pick up in the second half of 2003 and into 2004, as global uncertainties diminish. In light of domestic inflation pressures, the expectation that Canadian economic activity will remain near potential in 2003, the stimulative stance of monetary policy, and improved conditions in capital markets, the Bank has decided to raise the target for the overnight rate.
As indicated in the MPR Update, further reductions in monetary stimulus will be required to return inflation to the target over the medium term. The timing and pace of increases in policy interest rates will continue to depend on a number of considerations. These include the strength of demand pressures, the evolution of inflation expectations, the impact on confidence of geopolitical and global economic uncertainties, and the way in which developments in the Middle East affect demand and inflation, both globally and in Canada. The Bank will continue to monitor closely all these factors.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 15 April 2003.  The Monetary Policy Report will be published on 23 April 2003."
Bank of Canada raises overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 2 3/4 per cent,2002-07-16,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 2 3/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 3 per cent.
Since the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 4 June, the economic recovery in Canada has remained stronger than expected and has broadened across sectors. This momentum has been reflected in continued strong growth in employment and spending by households, as well as in some pickup of investment in machinery and equipment. As a result, the economy has been moving towards full production capacity more quickly than anticipated. Core inflation, which was 2.2 per cent in May, has remained a little higher than projected.
There are both positive and negative risks to the Canadian economic outlook. On the positive side, with considerable monetary stimulus in the economy, growth in Canada could very well continue to exceed expectations. On the negative side, the main risk is the marked uncertainty associated with recent global corporate and financial market developments and their potential effects on confidence and world economic growth.
The Bank's decision to raise interest rates represents a further measured reduction in the substantial amount of monetary stimulus in the economy. In the period ahead, the Bank will remain focused on taking the necessary actions to achieve the inflation target of 2 per cent over the medium term.
An elaboration of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation that were the basis for today's interest rate decision will be set out in the Monetary Policy Report Update, to be published on 24 July 2002.  The Bank's next scheduled date for announcing policy interest rates is 4 September 2002."
Bank of Canada Announces 2005 Recipients of Annual Law-Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence,2005-08-25,"The Bank of Canada is pleased to announce the 2005 recipients of its annual Law-Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence. Corporal Earle Bailey and Sergeant Peter Hadley, of the Windsor RCMP Commercial Crime Section, were honoured last night at an awards gala during the annual conference of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police held in Ottawa.
The recipients of the Award of Excellence were selected for their initiative and determination during a counterfeiting investigation conducted between September 2003 and March 2004. This investigation resulted in the seizure of approximately $1.6 million in counterfeit bank notes, and the dismantling of a large counterfeit production facility in the Greater Toronto Area. The efforts of Corporal Bailey and Sergeant Hadley also led to the prosecution of a major counterfeiter.
The Bank of Canada's Law-Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence was established in 2004 to recognize the work of Canadian law-enforcement personnel in deterring and preventing the counterfeiting of bank notes. ""The Bank believes that it is important to recognize the efforts of the Windsor RCMP investigators, since they prevented large volumes of counterfeit notes from entering into circulation,"" said Pierre Duguay, the Bank's Deputy Governor responsible for the issuance of bank notes. ""The success of this investigation also reflects a renewed emphasis on counterfeit detection and deterrence by Canada's national police force and other law-enforcement agencies.""
A photo from the awards presentation will be available on Canada NewsWire."
Bank of Canada releases 2006 schedule of dates for its policy interest rate announcements,2005-08-11,"The Bank of Canada today released its 2006 schedule of eight dates for announcing decisions on its key policy interest rate, and confirmed the announcement dates for the remainder of this year.

Bank of Canada keeps target for the overnight rate at 2 1/2 per cent,2004-12-07,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 2 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 2 3/4 per cent.
Information received since the October Monetary Policy Report (MPR) suggests that economic activity in Canada has been broadly in line with the Bank's expectations, with core inflation remaining below the 2 per cent inflation target. Although oil prices have declined, global economic growth prospects have moderated slightly. The U.S. dollar has depreciated further against major floating currencies, including the Canadian dollar. If exchange rates were to persist at current levels, and if all other economic and financial factors were to remain unchanged, there would be a dampening effect on aggregate demand for Canadian goods and services.
In light of these considerations, the Bank decided to leave the target for the overnight rate unchanged. With the overnight rate at 2 1/2 per cent, a considerable amount of monetary stimulus remains in the Canadian economy. As well, the underlying trends in the global economy continue to point to solid economic growth. Accordingly, the Bank will be paying close attention to the prospects for factors that affect pressures on capacity and, hence, inflation.
The main risks and uncertainties around the outlook for the Canadian economy remain those that the Bank identified and analyzed in the MPR. They relate to global imbalances, the realignment of currencies, commodity prices, the growing presence of emerging market economies such as China and India, and the related adjustments within the Canadian economy. The Bank will monitor these factors, with a view to keeping aggregate demand and supply in balance in order to achieve the inflation target.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 25 January 2005. The Monetary Policy Report Update will be published on 27 January 2005."
Bank of Canada Issues Upgraded $10 Bank Note,2005-05-18,"The Bank of Canada today put into circulation an upgraded $10 bank note with enhanced security features. The design, colour, and theme (Remembrance and Peacekeeping) of the upgraded $10 note are the same as those of the previously issued $10 note from the Canadian Journey series.
To improve the security of Canadian bank notes and to stay ahead of counterfeiters, the Bank is continuously researching and developing new and enhanced security features. The upgraded $10 note, like the $20, $50, and $100 notes of the Canadian Journey series, contains a metallic holographic stripe, a watermark portrait, a windowed colour-shifting thread woven into the paper, a see-through number, and enhanced fluorescence under ultraviolet lighting. The Bank is upgrading the $10 note in response to an increase in the counterfeiting of lower-denomination bank notes.
""These enhanced security features make it easy for consumers and cash-handlers to verify the authenticity of their bank notes, but difficult for counterfeiters to copy,"" said David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada.
The Bank provides its partners and the general public with educational materials to help familiarize them with the security features found on all Canadian bank notes, as well as the quick and easy techniques that can be used to distinguish a genuine from a counterfeit note. For more information on Canadian bank notes, their security features, and educational and training materials, visit https://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/.
""It simply makes good business sense for retailers to do what they can to protect themselves from accepting counterfeit notes,"" said Len Crispino, President and CEO of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. ""That is why we strongly encourage businesses to make use of the educational materials provided by the Bank of Canada, and to inform cash-handlers on how to detect counterfeit notes. Verifying the authenticity of a bank note takes only a few seconds, and can protect businesses from unnecessary losses due to counterfeiting.""
Since announcing its plan to upgrade the $10 note on 20 January 2005, the Bank has been working with its many partners, including retailers, financial institutions, and the manufacturers and operators of bank note handling equipment, to ensure the smooth introduction of the upgraded note into daily cash transactions.
The upgraded $10 note will be available across Canada within the next couple of weeks. As with all bank notes issued by the Bank of Canada, older versions of the $10 note still in circulation remain legal tender. The Bank expects to replace older $10 notes in circulation with the upgraded $10 notes within approximately one year."

Governor Dodge Discusses How Canada Is Adjusting to Global Economic Forces,2005-05-06,"Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge said today that Canada's economy is adjusting to powerful forces at work in the global economy, including the emergence of China and India as economic powerhouses, large and growing current account imbalances in the United States and Asia, rising commodity prices, and movements in exchange rates, including Canada's dollar.
In a speech to the Ottawa Chamber of Commerce, Governor Dodge said that the Bank's monetary policy is helping Canadian businesses meet these challenges and take advantage of emerging opportunities.
""The good news is that many Canadian firms are making adjustments,"" Governor Dodge said. ""Monetary policy is working to support this adjustment process by maintaining strong growth in domestic demand."" The Bank of Canada continues to monitor these global forces closely, assess their impact, and conduct monetary policy with the aim of keeping inflation close to target and the economy operating at its full potential.
Governor Dodge once again stressed that Canada must continue with efforts to encourage competition, transparency, and efficiency in domestic financial markets and institutions. ""If Canadians want sustainable economic growth and prosperity, our financial system must function as efficiently as possible,"" the Governor said."

Bank of Canada to Upgrade $10 Bank Note,2005-01-20,"As part of its ongoing efforts to improve the security of Canadian bank notes, the Bank of Canada will issue a $10 note with upgraded security features beginning 18 May 2005.
The upgraded note will have the same security features found on the $20, $50, and $100 Canadian Journey series notes issued in 2004. The improved features include a metallic holographic stripe, a watermark portrait, a windowed colour-shifting thread woven into the paper, a see-through number, and enhanced fluorescence under ultraviolet lighting. These features are reliable and quick and easy to use, and are designed to help Canadians protect themselves from accepting counterfeit notes. The illustrations on the front and back of the note will be the same as those on the $10 note issued in 2001.
The Bank continues to work with the retail and financial sectors as well as law enforcement agencies to inform cash-handlers about the anti-counterfeiting features found on Canadian notes. ""To minimize opportunities for counterfeiters, it is important for cash-handlers and consumers alike to take the few seconds that are needed to check the new easy-to-use security features,"" said David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada.
The Bank of Canada will work with the financial industry to remove previous versions of the $10 note from circulation and expects that most of the older $10 notes will be withdrawn in approximately one year. All Canadian bank notes remain legal tender.
The Bank of Canada is also collaborating with its partners to ensure the smooth introduction of the upgraded $10 note into daily cash exchanges. The Bank is providing manufacturers of bank note handling equipment—such as automated banking machines (ABMs), change-makers, and automated ticket dispensers—with the necessary information to make the required adjustments to their equipment. ""In order to ensure that bills are not rejected by bank note handling equipment, it is important for the owners and manufacturers of this equipment to be ready for the upgraded note on 18 May 2005,"" said Roy Poppe, President of the Canadian Automatic Merchandising Association. ""This simply makes good business sense.""

These anti-counterfeiting features are similar to those  found on the recently issued $100 and $20 notes.
Since the unveiling of the new $50 bank note on 13 October, the Bank of  Canada has been working with its key partners, including law-enforcement  agencies, financial institutions, and the retail and hospitality industries to  familiarize cash handlers with the note's security features.
""We have been working in close co-operation with the Bank of Canada and other  key partners to increase the level of counterfeit enforcement in Canada,"" said  Chief Superintendent Peter German, Director General, Financial Crimes, of the  Royal Canadian Mounted Police. ""By routinely checking the security features of  bank notes during cash transactions, Canadians can help protect themselves and  make a difference in the fight to keep counterfeits from entering into  circulation.""
The theme of the new $50 note is Nation Building: shaping the political,  legal, and social structures for democracy and equality. The back of the note  features images that highlight the advancement of democracy and equal rights in  Canada. The front of the note features a portrait of William Lyon Mackenzie  King, Canada's longest-serving prime minister.
The Bank of Canada plans to upgrade the security features of the $10 bank  note from the Canadian Journey series in the spring of 2005. The upgraded  security features will resemble those found on the new $20, $50, and $100 notes  from the same series. The note's theme and images will not change.

Bank of Canada raises overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 2 1/2 per cent,2002-06-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 2 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 2 3/4 per cent.
Information received since the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 16 April indicates that the economic recovery in Canada has been somewhat stronger than anticipated. And core inflation in April rose to 2.2 per cent, slightly above the level that had been projected. Total CPI inflation was 1.7 per cent.
Today's interest rate increase represents a further reduction in the substantial amount of monetary stimulus in the economy. Going forward, with the economy showing strong momentum and moving back towards full production capacity more quickly than had been expected, the Bank will take the action necessary to keep inflation at its 2 per cent target over the medium term. This will contribute to sustaining economic activity at full capacity.
The Bank's next scheduled date for announcing policy interest rates is 16 July 2002.  The Monetary Policy Report Update will be published on 24 July 2002."
Bank of Canada Issues New $20 Bank Notes,2004-09-29,"The Bank of Canada today put into circulation Canada's new $20 bank notes. The  new notes will be distributed and become available across the country over the  next few weeks.
""The $20 bank note is the most widely used note,"" said Bank of Canada  Governor David Dodge. ""It accounts for almost half of all bank notes in  circulation, which is why we encourage Canadians to become familiar with its  design and security features.

The Bank is issuing the new note to help fight counterfeiting and is  reminding consumers and retailers to make a habit of verifying their notes  before placing them in their wallets or cash drawers. The note incorporates  several new anti-counterfeiting features that are easy to identify and quick to  use. These include a metallic holographic stripe, a watermark portrait, a  windowed colour-shifting thread woven into the paper, and a see-through number.  These features are similar to those on the recently issued $100 note.
The theme of this new note is Arts and Culture. Images of four  artworks by internationally recognized Canadian artist, Bill Reid, as well as an  excerpt from Gabrielle Roy's novel, The Hidden Mountain, appear on the  back of the note.
Since the unveiling of the new $20 bank note on 25 August, the Bank of Canada  has been working with law-enforcement agencies, financial institutions, and the  retail and hospitality industries to familiarize their employees with the note's  security features.

Brisebois, President and CEO of the Retail Council of  Canada. ""That is why we continue to work with the Bank of Canada to help train  retailers and their staff on how to quickly identify a genuine bank note.""
""Everyone has a role to play in deterring counterfeiting,"" said Raymond J.  Protti, President and CEO of the Canadian Bankers Association. ""The banking  industry handles large volumes of cash and takes steps to detect counterfeit  notes and remove them from circulation.

Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity in Canada,1998-09-29,"Summary results of a survey of Canadian foreign  exchange and derivatives markets are now available. The survey was conducted by  the Bank of Canada in April 1998 and covered activity in the foreign exchange  and derivatives markets. Similar surveys were undertaken by about 40 other  countries during the same month, and the central banks of many of those  countries are also releasing their results today. Previous surveys were  conducted by the Bank of Canada in April 1983, March 1986, April 1989, April  1992, and April 1995.
All financial institutions in Canada active in the wholesale foreign exchange  and derivatives markets were surveyed. This included 38 financial institutions  and 10 foreign exchange and fixed-income brokers. With respect to foreign  exchange, the survey covered spot, outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps,  currency swaps, and over-the-counter (OTC) options. The interest rate products  covered included forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, and OTC options.  Participants were also asked to identify transactions by currency and type of  counterparty. A detailed analysis of the survey will appear in the Winter  1998-1999 issue of the Bank of Canada Review.
Note: The data collected by Canada and other countries will  be adjusted for cross-border double-counting and aggregated by the Bank for  International Settlements (BIS). It is expected that the BIS will issue a press  release with summary highlights of the global turnover results in October 1998.  A detailed report will be published in the late spring/early summer of 1999.

Data received since the July Monetary Policy Report Update indicate that Canada's economic growth in the first half of this year was somewhat stronger than the Bank had been expecting, largely as a result of more robust external demand for Canadian goods and services. The Bank judges that the economy is now operating close to its production capacity. Core inflation, which was 1.9 per cent in July, is consistent with this assessment. Total CPI inflation, at 2.3 per cent in July, has remained above expectations, primarily because oil prices have been persistently higher than the Bank had assumed.
Looking forward, the Bank expects aggregate demand to grow at, or marginally above, the rate of growth of production capacity. With the economy operating close to its capacity, monetary stimulus needs to be reduced to avoid a buildup of inflationary pressures. In this context, the Bank decided to raise its target for the overnight rate.
Uncertainties around the economic outlook continue to relate primarily to three factors: the estimated size of the output gap, the future growth of Canadian exports and imports, and the overall effect on the Canadian economy of current and future movements in the world prices of oil and non-energy commodities. In conducting monetary policy, the Bank will continue to pay attention to these factors as it assesses the evolving prospects for pressures on capacity and inflation.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 19 October 2004.  The Monetary Policy Report will be published on 21 October 2004."

Bank of Canada keeps target for the overnight rate at 2 per cent,2002-03-05,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 2 1/4 per cent.
Information received since the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 15 January indicates that the overall pace of economic activity in Canada and the United States has been stronger than expected, confirming that a recovery is underway. Canadian consumer price data for January show core inflation at 1.8 per cent and total CPI inflation at 1.3 per cent.
The substantial amount of monetary stimulus in the economy continues to support economic growth in Canada, consistent with returning inflation to its 2 per cent target over the medium term. While uncertainties remain, the Bank expects the economy to gather strength as the year progresses.
The Bank's next scheduled date for announcing policy interest rates is 16 April 2002.  The Monetary Policy Report will be published on 24 April 2002."
Bank of Canada releases 2005 schedule of dates for its policy interest rate announcements,2004-07-08,"The Bank of Canada today released its 2005 schedule of eight dates for announcing decisions on its key policy interest rate, and confirmed the announcement dates for the remainder of this year.

Bank of Canada lowers target for the overnight rate by 1/4 percentage point to 2 per cent,2004-04-13,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 2 1/4 per cent.
The Canadian economy continues to adjust to developments in the global economy. These include stronger world demand, higher commodity prices, the realignment of world currencies, including the Canadian dollar, and the intensified competition, together with the new trading opportunities, coming from emerging-market economies. These developments require shifts in activity among sectors and create a need for adjustments by many businesses. Monetary policy is facilitating these adjustments by supporting aggregate demand, with the goal of keeping the economy near its full potential and inflation on target.
The Bank's outlook for economic growth and inflation remains essentially unchanged from the outlook published in the January Monetary Policy Report Update. The economy is projected to return close to its production potential by the third quarter of 2005 and core inflation is projected to move back to the 2 per cent target by the end of 2005.
Against this backdrop, the Bank decided to lower the target for the overnight rate by a further quarter percentage point.
The risks to the outlook now appear balanced. An elaboration of the Bank's views on the outlook for inflation and the economy will be provided in the Monetary Policy Report, to be released on 15 April 2004.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 8 June 2004."
The Bank of Canada Issues New $100 Bank Notes,2004-03-17,"The Bank of Canada today officially put into circulation Canada's new $100 bank  notes. The new notes will be distributed and become available across the country  over the next two weeks.
""The new $100 note incorporates state-of-the-art security features designed  to combat counterfeiting,"" said Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge.
There are four new security features that protect the $100 bank note against  counterfeiting: a metallic holographic stripe, a watermarked portrait, a  windowed colour-shifting thread, and a see-through number. The note also  incorporates enhanced versions of security features with which Canadians are  already familiar, such as raised ink (intaglio), fine-line printing, and  improved fluorescence under ultraviolet lighting. To help blind and  vision-impaired individuals identify the new $100 bank note, it has a tactile  feature (raised dots) and large, high-contrast numerals.
Since the unveiling of the new $100 note at a ceremony in Halifax on 28  January 2004, the Bank of Canada has been working with law-enforcement agencies,  financial institutions, and the retail and hospitality industries to train their  employees on the note's security features.
""Everyone has a part to play in protecting our country's bank notes,"" said  Paul Marsh, Staff Sergeant of the RCMP. ""Together, we can fight counterfeiting.  Bank notes have security features that are reliable and easy to use. It's good  business practice to check your notes when you receive them—just as you count  your change. By checking your notes, you protect yourself and eliminate  opportunities for counterfeiters.""
Retail Council of Canada President and CEO Diane J. Brisebois welcomed the  new $100 bank note and its enhanced features. ""Retailers and their customers  have a major stake in the trustworthiness of our currency,"" she said. ""We are  delighted the new $100 bill is harder to counterfeit and contains easy ways of  verifying its validity. We will continue to work closely with the Bank of Canada  to help retailers train their staff on how to quickly check a bank note.""
The Bank of Canada plans to complete the introduction of the new Canadian  Journey series later this year when it issues the two remaining  high-denomination bank notes ($20 and $50). All bank notes from all previous  series remain legal tender.
For more information on Canadian bank notes and the new security features of the  $100 note.

Bank of Canada Announces Research Fellowship Award for 2004,2004-03-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that Professor René Garcia, of the Université  de Montréal, is the recipient of the Bank's Fellowship award for research for  2004.
Professor Garcia is internationally  recognized for his work in the fields of finance, macroeconomics, and financial  econometrics.
Governor David Dodge said, ""The Bank of Canada is delighted to support the  work of Professor Garcia. His research on the relationship between investor's  preferences, economic fundamentals, and asset pricing will lead to a better  understanding of the forces driving financial markets.""
The Bank's Fellowship Program was designed to encourage leading-edge research  and to develop expertise in Canada in a number of areas critical to the Bank's  mandate: macroeconomics, monetary economics, international finance, as well as  the economics of financial markets and institutions, including their stability.
In 2003, the first year of the program, the Bank granted fellowships to  Professor Michael Devereux of the University of British Columbia, and Professor  Shouyong Shi of the University of Toronto. The Bank plans to award an additional  fellowship in each of the next several years, for a total of six fellowships by  the end of 2007.

Bank of Canada Announces Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeiting Deterrence,2004-03-03,"The Bank of Canada today announced the creation of a Law Enforcement Award of  Excellence that will be presented annually to a police officer who demonstrates  outstanding commitment and initiative in the fight against bank note  counterfeiting.
The inaugural award will be presented in August at the Canadian Association  of Chiefs of Police (CACP) conference in Vancouver. Award recipients will  receive a citation from the Bank's Governor David Dodge.
The creation of the award is part of the Bank's continuing effort to improve  the security of Canadian bank notes and to encourage counterfeit detection and  prevention efforts by police agencies, businesses and individual Canadians.
""The Bank of Canada is proud to honour law enforcement's significant  contribution to the fight against counterfeiting,"" said Deputy Governor Pierre  Duguay who is responsible for the currency function. ""The new award supports the  Bank's commitment to provide bank notes that are readily accepted and in which  Canadians can have confidence.""
Superintendent Peter Cuthbert, Executive Director of the Canadian Association  of Chiefs of Police, said the CACP is pleased the Bank has chosen its annual  conference as the venue for presenting the new award. ""The CACP is truly  grateful to have the Bank of Canada as its partner: one that recognizes the  dedication, commitment and contribution of all front-line police officers in  combating currency counterfeiting in Canada,"" he said.
The award selection committee comprises three representatives from the Bank  of Canada, one representative from the RCMP, and one representative from the  CACP's Prevention of Crime in Industry Committee. Nominations will be solicited  from Canadian law enforcement agencies by April 30th of each year.

Bank of Canada lowers target for the overnight rate by 1/4 percentage point to 2 1/4 per cent,2004-03-02,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 2 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 2 1/2 per cent.
Information received since the Bank's last interest rate announcement has been broadly consistent with the economic outlook presented in the January Monetary Policy Report Update. As expected, core and total CPI inflation in January moved significantly below the 2 per cent inflation target. While external demand has been slightly stronger and final domestic demand in Canada slightly weaker than expected, the Bank's outlook remains, on balance, unchanged.
In this context, today's decision to provide some additional monetary stimulus was taken to support aggregate demand and to return inflation to the target by the end of 2005. The Bank will monitor closely the evolution of external and domestic demand and the pressures on inflation, as the economy adjusts to global changes.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 13 April 2004. The Monetary Policy Report will be published on 15 April 2004."
Bank of Canada lowers target for the overnight rate by 1/4 percentage point to 2 1/2 per cent,2004-01-20,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 2 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 2 3/4 per cent.
Both core and total CPI inflation remain below the 2 per cent inflation target. While inflation is exhibiting some volatility, underlying price pressures and the presence of spare capacity point to a core rate of inflation that will likely persist below the inflation target late into 2005. Despite stronger global economic growth, the rapid appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. currency has cut into the overall growth of aggregate demand for Canadian goods and services through weaker exports and increased imports. In addition, although employment growth has continued to be vigorous, recent indicators of domestic demand in the fourth quarter of 2003 have been somewhat weaker than projected. As a consequence, the output gap at the end of 2003 appears to be somewhat larger than the Bank was expecting. In light of these demand and inflation factors, and the likelihood that they will persist through this year and into 2005, the Bank has decided to lower the target for the overnight rate to provide additional support for growth in aggregate demand and thus help return inflation to the target over the medium term.
An elaboration of the Bank's views on the outlook for inflation, the economy, and the uncertainties surrounding aggregate demand growth will be provided in the Monetary Policy Report Update, to be released on 22 January 2004.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 2 March 2004."
Bank of Canada Announces Adviser Appointment,2004-01-16,"The Bank of Canada today announced the appointment of Pierre Godin to the  position of adviser. The appointment is for an 18-month period; Mr. Godin will  be joining the Bank in mid-March.
Mr. Godin is currently the Acting Chair of the Quebec Securities Commission.  From 2000 to 2002, he was Special Adviser to the Chair of the Quebec Securities  Commission, where his work focused on issues related to market structure and  self-regulation.

Bank of Canada keeps target for the overnight rate at 2 3/4 per cent,2002-09-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 2 3/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 3 per cent.
Consistent with the Bank's economic outlook in the July Monetary Policy Report Update, the Canadian economy continued its strong performance in the second quarter of the year and into the summer. Also, both core inflation and total CPI inflation in July were broadly in line with the Bank's expectations.
Stronger-than-expected growth in domestic demand in Canada continues, buoyed by the substantial amount of monetary stimulus in the economy. However, near-term prospects for growth in the United States and the major overseas economies appear to have weakened somewhat. There is also increased uncertainty associated with global financial market volatility and the unsettled geopolitical situation.
Taking these factors into consideration, the Bank has decided to leave its target for the overnight rate unchanged at this time. Looking forward, it remains the Bank's view that, as the Canadian economy continues to expand and to approach its production capacity, further measured reductions in monetary stimulus will be necessary in order to achieve the inflation control target of 2 per cent over the medium term.
The Bank's next scheduled date for announcing policy interest rates is 16 October 2002.  The Monetary Policy Report will be published on 23 October 2002."
Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge corrects a misstatement,2003-10-29,"Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge corrects a misstatement he made in  responding to a question yesterday relating to what he heard at the G-20 meeting  about U.S. growth and how it might affect Bank of Canada projections. He  unintentionally attributed specific projections of the Bank of Canada to the  Chairman of the Federal Reserve.
What Mr. Dodge intended to say was the following:
""After listening to Mr. Greenspan and the ensuing discussion, I want to  emphasize that I remain comfortable with our projections [those in the Bank of  Canada Monetary Policy Report of 22 October] of U.S. growth of close to  6 per cent for the third quarter—much stronger than we or anyone had earlier  anticipated—and about 4 per cent for the fourth quarter of 2003. In sum, I  didn't hear anything so very different that I would change our view on the U.S.  economy, although perhaps at the margin there was more optimism about  indications of an earlier pickup in investment in the United States than we had  assumed.""
Mr. Dodge apologizes for his unintentional attribution of Bank of Canada  projections to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve."
Bank of Canada lowers target for the overnight rate by 1/4 percentage point to 2 3/4 per cent,2003-09-03,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 2 3/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3 per cent.
Since the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 15 July, inflation pressures have continued to ease. Core inflation has declined below the 2 per cent inflation target earlier than the Bank anticipated, and it appears that lower inflation will persist over the coming months.
As expected, economic growth was interrupted in the second quarter of the year, and the pace of growth in the third quarter will likely remain below potential. This recent weakness reflects the impact of a number of near-term factors such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the effect of an isolated case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) on exports of Canadian beef and cattle, the power blackout in Ontario, and the forest fires in Western Canada.
Notwithstanding these developments, there are clear indications that conditions are in place for a strengthening of economic growth. Final domestic demand growth has remained robust and the adverse effects of the near-term factors are beginning to dissipate. The economic rebound in the United States began earlier, and will be stronger, than previously expected. As well, the tone of capital markets remains favourable. Overall, despite current weakness, the accumulation of economic evidence to date reinforces the Bank's view that growth in the Canadian economy will strengthen towards the end of 2003 and through 2004.
With today's decision, policy interest rates will support the return to levels of economic activity consistent with achieving an overall balance of aggregate demand and supply and thus keeping inflation near the target over the medium term.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 15 October 2003.  The Monetary Policy Report will be published on 22 October 2003."
Bank of Canada releases 2004 schedule of dates for its policy interest rate announcements,2003-07-24,"The Bank of Canada today released its 2004 schedule of eight dates for announcing decisions on its key policy interest rate, and confirmed the announcement dates for the remainder of this year.

Bank of Canada lowers target for the overnight rate by 1/4 percentage point to 3 per cent,2003-07-15,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 3 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3 1/4 per cent.
In recent months, there have been a number of unanticipated developments that bear on the outlook for inflation and economic activity in Canada. Both inflation and inflation expectations have declined more rapidly than the Bank had expected. Near-term domestic economic activity has been undercut by the effects of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and an isolated case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in Canada. Foreign demand for Canadian products has also been weaker than earlier anticipated. In addition, the rapid and sizable appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. currency will tend to have a dampening effect on the demand for tradable Canadian goods and services.
In this context, inflation pressures have eased and more economic slack is opening up in Canada than was previously projected. Today's interest rate reduction will provide support for domestic demand growth, and consequently for levels of aggregate demand consistent with keeping inflation on a track to meet the 2 per cent target over the medium term.
Looking ahead, the Bank still expects that growth in the Canadian economy will strengthen towards the end of 2003 and through 2004, underpinned by domestic demand, by the favourable conditions in capital markets, and by the anticipated rebound in the U.S. economy. An elaboration of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation will be provided in the Monetary Policy Report Update, to be released this Thursday, 17 July.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 3 September 2003."
Bank of Canada keeps target for the overnight rate at 3 1/4 per cent,2003-06-03,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 3 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 3 1/2 per cent.
Data released since the Bank's last interest rate announcement indicate that both core and total CPI inflation declined in April more than expected. Some of this decline was due to transitory factors, most notably the rebate on electricity prices in Ontario. The Canadian economy continued to expand in the first quarter of 2003, reflecting firmness in domestic demand. This was broadly in line with expectations in the April Monetary Policy Report. More recent developments bearing on aggregate demand for Canadian output, including continuing weakness in the U.S. and global economies and concerns about the economic impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), point to the likelihood of some near-term softness in the Canadian economy. There has also been significant adjustment in the value of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, including the Canadian dollar.
Looking forward, it remains the Bank's view that growth in the Canadian economy will be underpinned by the underlying strength of domestic demand and by the expected rebound in the U.S. economy towards the end of 2003 and through 2004. And, while there is likely to be some increase in core inflation in the coming months as a result of the unwinding of the transitory factors mentioned above, it now appears that both core and total CPI inflation will return to the 2 per cent target somewhat earlier than the Bank expected in April. In these circumstances, the Bank has decided to leave its policy interest rates unchanged.
The Bank will monitor closely inflation developments, the strength of domestic demand, and signs of recovery in the U.S. and global economies, and will continue to assess the effects of the appreciation of the Canadian dollar on aggregate demand and price levels in Canada. An update of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation will be provided in the July Monetary Policy Report Update.
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 15 July 2003.  The Monetary Policy Report Update will be published on 17 July 2003."

The Bank's Governing  Council named Professor Michael Devereux of the University of British Columbia  and Professor Shouyong Shi of the University of Toronto as the first fellowship  recipients.
Professor Devereux is internationally  recognized for his work in the field of international economics. He is one of  the foremost experts in the area of new Keynesian open-economy models. Professor  Devereux's current research focuses on two areas: exchange rates and pricing,  and macroeconomic issues in emerging-market economies.
Professor Shi has earned international  recognition in the field of macroeconomics. His papers on money and labour  markets represent a significant contribution to the profession. Professor Shi's  efforts are currently concentrated on building a micro-foundation of monetary  theory and policy.
Governor David Dodge said ""the Bank of Canada is proud to support the work of  these two outstanding economists and looks forward to their continued  contributions to economic research critical to the Bank's mandate.""
The Bank's Fellowship Program was designed to encourage leading-edge research  and to develop expertise in Canada in the fields of macroeconomics, monetary  economics, international finance, and the economics of financial markets and  institutions (including issues related to stability).
This being the first year of the Program, two fellowships have been granted.  The Bank plans to award an additional fellowship in each subsequent year, for a  total of six fellowships by the end of 2007.
For more information on the Fellowship Program, visit www.bankofcanada.ca/fellowship or call (613) 782-8888."
Senior Deputy Governor Malcolm Knight appointed new General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements,2003-01-13,"The Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), based in  Switzerland, announced today the appointment of Malcolm Knight as the new  General Manager of the BIS, beginning in April 2003. 1 Mr. Knight has been Senior  Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada since 1999, following a career with the  International Monetary Fund in Washington.
Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge said, ""The Bank of Canada is very sorry  to lose Mr. Knight, whose excellent leadership as Senior Deputy Governor has  been important to the Bank's success over the past several years. However, the  Bank is very proud that Malcolm's abilities and expertise have been recognized  by the international community of central banks. We wish him well as he assumes  the leadership of the BIS, an institution that is such an important forum for  co-operation among central banks.""
The Board of Directors of the Bank of Canada is immediately forming a selection committee to search for a  replacement for Mr. Knight. The Board's appointment of a new Senior Deputy  Governor is subject to Order-in-Council approval."
Bank of Canada Announces Retirement of Deputy Governor Charles Freedman,2002-11-22,"Today, the Bank of Canada announced that Deputy Governor Charles (Chuck) Freedman will retire from the Bank effective 5 September 2003.
Mr. Freedman joined the Bank in 1974.  He was appointed Adviser to the Governor in 1984 and Deputy Governor in 1988.
Mr. Freedman focuses on matters related to monetary policy, financial institutions, and clearing and settlement systems. As a member of the Governing Council, he shares responsibility for formulating and implementing monetary policy and for dealing with broad organizational and strategic issues at the Bank.
The Bank's Board of Directors will undertake a selection process to replace  Mr. Freedman."
Bank of Canada releases its October Monetary Policy Report,2002-10-23,"Today, the Bank of Canada released its October Monetary Policy Report, in which it discusses economic and financial trends in the context of Canada's inflation-control strategy.
The Canadian economy has been expanding strongly so far this year and is now operating fairly close to its full production capacity. Consumer price inflation has risen above the 2 per cent target and is expected to rise further before year-end because of high oil prices and a number of other relative price movements. What is important for monetary policy is that these one-off influences on specific prices not feed more generally into price and wage inflation.
The Canadian economy has grown more rapidly than those of all other G-7 countries over the past year. Annualized growth exceeded 5 per cent in the first half of 2002—well above the growth of the economy's potential. We estimate that Canada's economy grew at an annualized rate of about 4 per cent in the third quarter. Thus, there has been a significant reduction in the amount of excess supply in the economy so far this year.
Looking ahead, global economic, financial, and geopolitical uncertainties are likely to moderate the rate of Canada's economic growth over the next three quarters. Growth should come in at the bottom of, or slightly below, the 3 to 4 per cent range that we anticipated in the last Update.
The output gap is very small. Assuming the uncertainties now clouding the outlook dissipate in the second half of next year, we expect growth to accelerate to above potential at that time, absorbing the remaining small amount of excess supply.
The Bank's core measure of inflation is running above our earlier projections. This largely reflects sharp increases in home and auto insurance premiums and, in Ontario, electricity prices. Core inflation is also being pushed up by strong demand for housing.
All told, core inflation is expected to peak at about 3 per cent by the end of this year. But, as the one-time influences fade, core inflation is expected to decline in the second half of 2003, provided those one-time factors do not feed into price and wage inflation more generally.
The Canadian economy is now operating not far from its capacity. In order to sustain non-inflationary growth, we will need to continue to remove monetary stimulus before the excess supply in the economy is completely absorbed. The pace and extent of this action will depend on the balance of domestic and external developments and on their implications for pressures on capacity and inflation in Canada."
Bank of Canada releases 2003 schedule of dates for policy interest rate announcements,2002-08-29,"The Bank of Canada today released its 2003 schedule of eight dates for announcing decisions on its key policy interest rate and, at the same time, confirmed the announcement dates for the remainder of this year.
The schedule of announcement dates from September 2002 through December 2003 is:
Wednesday 4 September 2002 Wednesday 16 October 2002  Tuesday 3 December 2002
Tuesday 21 January 2003 Tuesday 4 March 2003 Tuesday 15 April 2003  Tuesday 3 June 2003 Tuesday 15 July 2003 Wednesday 3 September 2003 Wednesday 15 October 2003 Tuesday 2 December 2003
All announcements will continue to be made at 9 a.m. (ET).
""The Bank's fixed schedule for announcing policy interest rate decisions continues to make an important contribution to the effectiveness of Canadian monetary policy and its communication,"" said Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge. ""As a result, we have witnessed an improvement in the debate and discussion around monetary policy issues in Canada."""
Bank of Canada Governor Reviews Progress in Strengthening International Financial Architecture and Resolving Financial Crises,2002-05-14,"In a speech to the Canadian Club of Ottawa and the Canadian Institute of International Affairs, Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge reviewed the progress made in strengthening the international financial architecture, preventing global financial crises, and expediting orderly solutions in the event of a crisis.
Mr. Dodge stressed that in an interconnected world, Canada's open economy is very much affected by world events—hence, our strong interest in a healthy international financial environment.
The Governor said that much has been done to develop a strategy to reduce the incidence of future crises. The key elements of that strategy are sound and credible macroeconomic policies, including an appropriate exchange rate regime, and a robust financial infrastructure.
Mr. Dodge pointed out that ""when it comes to crisis management and resolution, the international community is still hard at work. Many issues on how to put in place a framework for promoting orderly debt restructuring remain outstanding. But significant progress is being made.""
In this context, he suggested that the Action Plan endorsed by the G-7 countries last month was an important step. He highlighted, in particular, the plan's recognition of the need for clear limits on official lending. The Bank views such limits as key in promoting more realistic expectations among debtors and creditors and thus providing the right incentives for the timely resolution of crises.
The Governor said that a lot more needs to be done to ensure that the ideas of the Action Plan are effectively implemented. This is important. ""The stakes are high—not only because of the economic costs, but because of the social costs and the human suffering caused by financial crises. And, in an increasingly integrated world, more than ever, we are all in this together."""
Bank of Canada releases its April Monetary Policy Report,2002-04-24,"The Bank of Canada today released its semi-annual Monetary Policy Report, in which it discusses economic and financial trends in the context of Canada's inflation-control strategy.
Canada's economic outlook has improved significantly since the November Monetary Policy Report. Indeed, information on the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of 2002 indicates that the recovery in the Canadian economy began sooner and has been considerably stronger than anticipated.
The Bank now projects that the Canadian economy will grow between 3 1/2 and 4 1/2 per cent at annualized rates in the first half of 2002. It is expected to continue to expand at a rate above that of its production capacity in the second half of 2002 and in 2003. Thus, the economy is expected to be operating at full capacity in the second half of 2003.
In light of this outlook, the Bank began to reduce the substantial amount of monetary stimulus in the economy, raising the target for the overnight rate of interest by 25 basis points to 2.25 per cent on 16 April.
Nonetheless, important risks and uncertainties remain. Given the amount of monetary stimulus in place, growth in Canada could be stronger than projected. It is also possible that growth in household spending may not be as strong as anticipated, if more of the recent strength than assumed was borrowed from future expenditures. There is also uncertainty regarding the timing and strength of the pickup in business investment and exports, and how developments in the Middle East could affect crude oil prices and the global economy.
The challenge for monetary policy over the remainder of this year and through 2003 is to help the economy move back to, and then sustain, levels of production at capacity by taking actions aimed at achieving the Bank's 2 per cent target for inflation control. This means reducing, in a timely and measured manner, the substantial amount of stimulus in place."
Bank of Canada raises overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 2 1/4 per cent,2002-04-16,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 2 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 2 1/2 per cent.
The accumulated information since the beginning of the year continues to indicate stronger-than-expected economic growth in Canada and the United States. A robust recovery appears to be underway in Canada. At the same time, there are uncertainties with respect to the continued strength of household spending, the timing and strength of the recovery in business fixed investment, and the implications for the global economy of recent developments in the Middle East. In February, core inflation rose to 2.2 per cent, somewhat above the level projected for the next few months. Total CPI inflation was 1.5 per cent.
With today's interest rate increase, the Bank is modestly reducing the amount of monetary stimulus in the economy. Substantial monetary stimulus remains in place to support continuing economic growth. This is consistent with keeping inflation at its 2 per cent target over the medium term. Details of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation will be presented in the Monetary Policy Report, to be published on 24 April 2002.
The Bank's next scheduled date for announcing policy interest rates is 4 June 2002."
Canada's new $5 bank note launched on 27 March 2002,2002-03-25,"PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT
Canada's new $5 bank note will be launched Wednesday, 27 March, in Montréal. The second bank note in the new Canadian Journey series will be unveiled by the Honourable Paul Martin, Minister of Finance and David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada.

Bank of Canada lowers key policy interest rate by 1/4 percentage point to 2 per cent,2002-01-15,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 2 1/4 per cent.
In the November Monetary Policy Report, the Bank indicated that the timing and extent of the recovery in economic activity in Canada this year would depend on geopolitical developments and the pace of the return of consumer and business confidence to normal levels. Since then, uncertainty has been reduced as geopolitical developments have evolved positively and consumer confidence has improved. However, business confidence both in Canada and abroad remains weak.
Although the Canadian economy is expected to gather momentum in the course of this year, it will nonetheless remain in excess supply through 2002, putting downward pressure on inflation. Core inflation, which declined to 1.7 per cent in November, is likely to stay around its current level through mid-2002 and to average just under 1 1/2 per cent in the second half of the year. Total CPI inflation, which fell sharply to 0.7 per cent in November, is expected to remain below the core rate until late 2002.
The interest rate cut announced today brings the cumulative easing in the target for the overnight rate over the past 12 months to 3 3/4 percentage points. This easing, together with the improvement in the overall economic climate, should underpin growth through 2002 and 2003. The outcome would be consistent with returning inflation to its 2 per cent target over the medium term.
The Monetary Policy Report Update will be published on 23 January 2002, a week earlier than in the past. In future, it will be Bank practice to publish the Monetary Policy Report and the Update one week, rather than two weeks, after a fixed announcement date.  The Bank's next scheduled date for announcing policy interest rates is 5 March 2002."
Bank of Canada lowers key policy interest rate by 1/2 percentage point to 2 1/4 per cent,2001-11-27,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate 1 by one-half of one percentage point to 2 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 2 1/2 per cent.
Recent economic developments in Canada have been broadly consistent with expectations at the time of the last policy interest rate announcement on 23 October, as presented in the November Monetary Policy Report. Accordingly, the Bank continues to anticipate that the economy will be operating with excess capacity throughout 2002. Core inflation, which slowed to 2.2 per cent in October, is thus expected to decline further to about 1 1/2 per cent in the second half of 2002. Total CPI inflation, which dropped to 1.9 per cent in October, is expected to remain below core inflation in 2002, if energy prices stay at or below their levels in early September.
Today's interest rate reduction provides additional support for growth in domestic demand, consistent with returning inflation to the Bank's 2-per-cent inflation target over the medium term. The cumulative reduction in policy interest rates since the beginning of 2001 is now 3 1/2 percentage points. This represents a substantial amount of monetary stimulus which, in the period ahead, will work to counteract the weakness in aggregate demand.
It is still too early to characterize the economic outlook with great assurance, given ongoing uncertainties. The November Monetary Policy Report set out the Bank's two working assumptions, which are that there will be no further major escalation of terrorism and that consumer and business confidence will return to normal levels in the second half of 2002. Geopolitical developments since then have been consistent with these assumptions.
The Bank's next scheduled date for announcing policy interest rates is 15 January 2002. The Monetary Policy Report Update will be published on 23 January 2002."
Bank of Canada lowers key policy interest rate by 3/4 percentage point to 2 3/4 per cent,2001-10-23,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate 1 by three-quarters of one percentage point to 2 3/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3 per cent.
Over the course of the summer, a more pronounced weakening trend in economic activity became evident in Canada and globally. The terrorist attacks of 11 September appear to have exacerbated this trend. As a consequence, levels of economic activity in Canada through the second half of this year and the first half of next year will be further below the economy's potential output than previously expected. This will result in persistent downward pressure on inflation through much of next year. Core inflation, which was 2.3 per cent in September, is now expected to move down below 2 per cent in early 2002. Total CPI inflation, which was 2.6 per cent in September, should also decline below 2 per cent by early 2002, if energy prices remain at or below their early-September levels.
Today's interest rate cut, which brings the total reduction in policy interest rates since the beginning of the year to 3 percentage points, is intended to underpin confidence and provide additional support for domestic demand growth through 2002, consistent with keeping inflation near the Bank's target of 2 per cent over the medium term. In this environment of exceptional uncertainties about geopolitical developments and business and household confidence, the Bank will continue to monitor economic developments very closely.
The Monetary Policy Report will be published on 7 November 2001. The Bank's next scheduled date for announcing policy interest rates is 27 November 2001."
Survey of foreign exchange and derivatives market activity in Canada,2001-10-09,"Summary results of a survey of activity in Canadian foreign exchange and derivatives markets conducted by the Bank of Canada in April 2001 are now available. Similar surveys were undertaken in over 45 other countries during the same month, and the central banks of many of those countries are also releasing their results today. This worldwide effort was coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which is issuing a press release today that summarizes highlights of the aggregated global turnover. 1 Surveys have been conducted by the Bank of Canada every three years since 1983, and the results of those surveys are shown in the tables included with this release.
All financial institutions in Canada active in the wholesale foreign exchange and derivatives markets were surveyed. These consisted of 28 financial institutions and 5 foreign exchange and fixed-income brokers. With respect to foreign exchange, the survey covered spot transactions, outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps, 2 currency swaps, and over-the-counter (OTC) options. The interest rate products covered were forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, and OTC options. Participants were also asked to identify transactions by currency and type of counterparty.

Bank of Canada releases 2002 schedule of dates for policy interest rate announcements,2001-10-01,"The Bank of Canada today released its schedule of eight dates for announcing decisions on its key policy interest rate for 2002. The schedule of announcement dates for the remainder of this year and for 2002 is:
All announcements will continue to be made at 9 a.m. (ET).
In the interest of providing more timely information, the Bank also announced that, beginning in 2002, its semi-annual Monetary Policy Report will be released approximately one week after the announcement dates in April and October, and the Update to the report will be released about one week after the announcement dates in January and July. These reports will therefore be available about one week earlier than has been the practice in the past. Both the Monetary Policy Report and the Update reflect the economic developments and outlook underlying the interest rate decision that precedes their publication. The Bank will announce the specific release dates of the Monetary Policy Report and the Update for 2002 before the end of this year.
""The Bank's overall experience with a fixed schedule for announcing monetary policy actions has been very favourable,"" said Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge. ""We believe that scheduled announcement dates have contributed both to the effectiveness of monetary policy and to more focused public commentary on the economic situation in Canada."""
Bank of Canada lowers key policy interest rate by 1/2 percentage point to 3 1/2 per cent,2001-09-17,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate 1 by one-half of one percentage point to 3 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3 3/4 per cent.
The tragic acts of terrorism in the United States on 11 September may pose significant challenges to consumer and business confidence in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere. Accordingly, the Bank is taking this action today to underpin confidence and provide further support for economic growth in Canada. The Bank's decision to act outside of its normal schedule of announcement dates reflects the need for prompt action to counteract potential effects on confidence in the aftermath of the extraordinary events in the United States.
The Bank's next scheduled date for announcing policy interest rates is 23 October 2001."
Bank of Canada lowers key policy interest rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 per cent,2001-08-28,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate 1 by one-quarter of one percentage point to 4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 4 1/4 per cent. With today's action, the total reduction in interest rates by the Bank this year amounts to 1 3/4 percentage points.
Economic data released since the Bank's last policy interest rate announcement on 17 July suggest that the pace of growth of the Canadian economy has been slower than expected. In part, this slowing reflects reduced demand from abroad for Canadian manufactured goods and primary products. The most important factor in this regard has been the ongoing weakness in the U.S. economy, particularly in capital spending. As well, economic growth outside North America has slowed significantly. Within Canada, growth in final domestic demand has softened, and the adjustment of inventory levels in some sectors, especially in telecommunications manufacturing, is not as far advanced as had been expected.
As a consequence of these developments, the Bank now expects economic growth in the third and fourth quarters of this year to be below potential, resulting in a lower level of activity than earlier expected. This implies reduced pressures on production capacity and inflation through the rest of this year and into 2002.
In July, total CPI inflation fell sharply to 2.6 per cent, largely because of declines in gasoline and natural gas prices. While core inflation increased slightly, to 2.4 per cent, the Bank still projects consumer price inflation to fall to about 2 per cent by the end of the year as a result of reduced pressures in product and labour markets.
In these conditions of slower-than-expected growth and associated easing in inflation pressures, today's interest rate reduction, together with the monetary stimulus already in place, is intended to provide support for domestic demand growth. This is expected to contribute to moving the economy, in the second half of next year, back towards levels of activity consistent with keeping inflation near the Bank's target of 2 per cent. Given the continuing uncertainties in the global economy, particularly the timing and strength of the recovery in investment in the United States, as well as uncertainty surrounding domestic demand in Canada, the Bank will continue to monitor developments closely.
The Bank's next scheduled date for announcing policy interest rates is 23 October 2001."
Bank of Canada lowers key policy interest rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 1/4 per cent,2001-07-17,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate 1 by one-quarter of one percentage point to 4 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 4 1/2 per cent.
The slower pace of economic growth in Canada, largely stemming from developments in the United States, continued through the second quarter of 2001. As a result, pressures on production capacity have eased, thus reducing inflation pressures. Core inflation, which is currently a little above 2 per cent, is projected to move down to about 2 per cent in the second half of this year. Total CPI inflation, which has lately been well above the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control target range, is expected to fall in the coming months to about 2 per cent by the end of the year. Recent declines in the prices of gasoline, natural gas and crude oil are mitigating the risk that high energy prices earlier this year could more broadly affect Canadian consumer prices.
Today's rate cut brings the total reduction in interest rates by the Bank this year to 1 1/2 percentage points. This cumulative reduction will underpin domestic economic growth in the face of weaker-than-anticipated economic conditions outside North America and continuing uncertainty about the timing and strength of the recovery in investment in the United States. The Bank continues to expect that the pace of growth in Canada will increase in the second half of 2001, with further gains in 2002. This would be consistent with keeping inflation close to the inflation-control target of 2 per cent through 2002. The Bank will remain alert to further developments.
The Monetary Policy Report Update will be published on 1 August 2001. The Bank's next scheduled date for announcing policy interest rates is 28 August 2001."
Bank of Canada lowers key policy rate by 1/4 per cent,2001-05-29,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate 1 by one-quarter of one percentage point to 4 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is reduced by one-quarter of one percentage point to 4 3/4 per cent.
The slowing in economic growth in Canada that began in late 2000 has continued through the first part of this year, largely as a result of reduced U.S. demand for Canadian products. At the same time, final domestic demand in Canada has continued to exhibit underlying momentum. Overall, the pace of expansion in the first half of this year has fallen below the growth rate of potential output, leading to some slack in the economy. These conditions should put downward pressure on core inflation, 2 which is expected to fall from above 2 per cent currently to just below 2 per cent by the end of 2001. Total CPI inflation, which has recently been above the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control target range because of rising energy prices, is expected to remain above 3 per cent over the next few months, before moving down to about 2 per cent by the end of the year.
In these circumstances, today's reduction in interest rates will support aggregate demand in the economy consistent with keeping inflation close to the Bank's inflation-control target of 2 per cent over the medium term.
The Bank continues to view the possibility that the economic slowdown in the United States could last longer than anticipated as the main risk to the outlook for the Canadian economy. At the same time, given the sustained increases in energy prices, the Bank will need to be vigilant for signs of broader effects on consumer prices generally.
The Bank's next scheduled date for announcing policy interest rates is 17 July 2001.  The Monetary Policy Report Update will be published on 1 August 2001."

Bank releases background information on renewal of the inflation-control target,2001-05-18,"The Bank of Canada today released the document Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target: Background Information, which provides additional details on the target arrangements and on how the Bank plans to implement them in order to increase the predictability of inflation over the longer term. This release follows the announcement yesterday by the Government of Canada and the Bank that the inflation-control target is being renewed for a period of five years to the end of 2006.
The document points out that the basic framework for conducting monetary policy under the inflation-control target is being maintained, but that the Bank is strengthening the way the target arrangements are implemented. The following are the key elements of the approach to implementing the renewed target:"
Bank of Canada lowers Bank Rate by 1/4 per cent,2001-04-17,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering the Bank Rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 5 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate 1 is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank's target for the overnight rate is reduced to 4 3/4 per cent.
Since late 2000, the pace of economic expansion in Canada has slowed to a rate below the economy's long-run growth potential. Information received since 6 March, the Bank's last fixed announcement date, confirms that this slowing is broadly in line with the Bank's expectations. The slowdown has largely been a consequence of the marked easing in the pace of U.S. economic growth, while final domestic demand has maintained its underlying momentum. Overall, the Canadian economy is expected to be operating somewhat below capacity by the middle of 2001, putting downward pressure on inflation. Core inflation, currently 2 per cent, is thus expected to ease. The rate of increase in the total CPI, currently close to 3 per cent, is expected to move down to 2 per cent by the end of 2001.
In light of the slowing pace of growth and the movement towards a position of excess supply, today's interest rate reduction, together with earlier reductions announced in January and March, is intended to support growth in aggregate demand, consistent with the Bank's policy objective of keeping inflation close to the midpoint of its 1 to 3 per cent target range over the medium term.
It remains the Bank's view that, following the slowdown in the first half of this year, Canada's economic growth will strengthen in the second half and in 2002. This expected pickup reflects a number of factors, including completion of the current inventory adjustment, continuing investment in new technology, recent tax cuts, the easing in domestic monetary conditions and, most importantly, the resumption of stronger U.S. economic growth. Given the uncertainties related to the timing and strength of the U.S. rebound, the Bank will continue to monitor developments closely.
A detailed explanation of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation will be set out in the Monetary Policy Report to be published on 1 May 2001. The next scheduled date for a Bank Rate announcement is 29 May 2001."
Bank of Canada lowers Bank Rate to 5 1/4 per cent,2001-03-06,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering the Bank Rate by one-half of one percentage point to 5 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank's target for the overnight rate is reduced to 5 per cent.
Since 23 January, the Bank's last fixed announcement date, there have been indications that the slowdown in the U.S. economy in the first half of 2001 could be more pronounced than expected, and there is a risk that weakening confidence could delay the U.S. recovery. In Canada, recent information suggests that the positive underlying momentum in the economy at the end of 2000 was somewhat less strong than had been previously estimated, and that pressures on productive capacity and inflation are lower as a result.
Today's action was taken in light of these developments and related uncertainties. The reduction in interest rates, together with rising disposable incomes bolstered by recent tax reductions, will help to underpin domestic demand. The Bank remains of the view that the overall pace of economic activity in Canada will rebound in the second half of the year. This will lead to a level of economic activity that is consistent with maintaining the core rate of inflation close to 2 per cent, the midpoint of the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control target range. Assuming that world energy prices remain around current levels, the Bank continues to expect that the annual rate of increase in the total CPI will move down to about 2 per cent in the second half of this year.
The next scheduled date for a Bank Rate announcement is 17 April 2001. The Monetary Policy Report will be published on 1 May 2001."
Bank of Canada lowers Bank Rate to 5 3/4 per cent,2001-01-23,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering the Bank Rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 5 3/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank's target for the overnight rate is reduced to 5 1/2 per cent.
The Bank's action was taken in light of a number of considerations bearing on the Canadian economic outlook and the future trend of inflation, in particular the slowdown in the United States.
Over recent months the underlying momentum of the Canadian economy has remained solid, bolstered by stronger-than-expected growth in domestic demand, and the economy has been operating close to full capacity. Information on consumer price inflation for December released last week indicates that core inflation, at 1.9 per cent, has moved up near the midpoint of the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control target range sooner than expected. The rate of increase in the total CPI has remained above the top end of the target range, reflecting the large increases in energy prices over the past year.
Recent information indicates that the outlook for the U.S. economy has weakened more abruptly than had been anticipated. This development, together with other information received since the Bank's Monetary Policy Report last November, suggests that growth in Canadian output this year is likely to slow to a rate close to potential growth, whereas three months ago economic growth was expected to be above potential.
In the Bank's judgment, today's interest rate reduction will help maintain a balance between aggregate demand and supply in the economy and keep core inflation near the 2 per cent midpoint of the target range. The Bank projects that inflation measured by the total CPI will move down to a rate close to core inflation in the second half of this year, on the assumption that world energy prices stabilize at or below present levels.
Given current uncertainties, the Bank will continue to closely watch evolving domestic and external economic developments with a view to preserving the low inflation environment that has benefited the Canadian economy.
The Monetary Policy Report Update will be published on 6 February 2001. The next scheduled date for a Bank Rate announcement is 6 March 2001."
"Redesigned $10 Bank Note Launched - New Note Series to Feature Canada's Culture, History and Achievements",2001-01-17,"The Bank of Canada launched the first in a new series of bank notes today. The themes of the notes in the new series, entitled Canadian Journey, reflect Canadians' views of their culture, history, and achievements, said Gordon Thiessen, Governor of the Bank of Canada, as he unveiled the $10 note at the Bank.
Deputy Prime Minister Herb Gray was present at the event to announce the bank note themes and to assist with the unveiling.
The back of the redesigned $10 note features the theme of Remembrance and Peacekeeping. It represents Canada's participation in peacekeeping activities as well as the remembrance of all Canadians who participated in past wars. A picture of Sir John A. Macdonald remains on the front of the new note.
""Canada's new bank notes will display subject matter chosen with input from Canadians across the country,"" said Mr. Thiessen. ""I am extremely proud of our newest bank note series, which is distinguished by new anti-counterfeiting features, world-class designs, and a unique durable tactile feature to assist the blind and vision-impaired. Raising public awareness of our currency is an important preventive measure against counterfeiting.""
The new notes will contain many new sophisticated security features designed to thwart counterfeiters. Since the current note series was introduced in 1986, significant technological advances in bank note production have made it possible to incorporate better security features into paper currency. This comes at a time when affordable high-resolution colour copiers, inkjet printers, and computer scanners have increased the potential for counterfeiting.
A major enhancement to the new series is the addition of a durable tactile feature that will greatly improve the ability of the blind and vision-impaired to recognize different denominations.
""Currency is a national symbol and a fitting place to capture some of the many events, scenes and people that have shaped our history and our lives as Canadians,"" said Deputy Prime Minister Herb Gray as he announced the new bank note themes.
The images on the backs of the notes are changing but the Queen and prime ministers who are featured on the front of the current notes will remain, with new portraits. The notes will be the same size, and the existing dominant colours on each denomination will be maintained.
The new themes were chosen after consultation with thousands of Canadians who expressed their views about Canada's significant achievements and aspirations.
The new note titles and the subject matter that will appear on the backs are:
Children from primary schools across Canada supported the launch of the new series with their interpretations of the themes. Artwork displayed at the Bank of Canada was from Seymour Heights Elementary School, Vancouver; St. John Fine Art School, Calgary; École Côte du Nord, Hull; St. Luke Catholic School, Ottawa; École Lanaudière, Montréal; St. Patrick's-Alexandra School, Halifax; and Sir Ernest MacMillan Public School, Burlington.
The $5 note will be issued later in 2001, and the remaining new notes ($20, $50, and $100) will be introduced over the next two to three years. The current notes will remain legal tender even after the new notes are introduced."
Janet Cosier Appointed Chair of Canadian Payments Association,2001-01-15,"The Bank of Canada announced today that Janet Cosier, Adviser to the Governor, has been appointed Chair of the Board of Directors of the Canadian Payments Association.
Mrs. Cosier, who holds degrees from York University and the University of Windsor, is a Certified Management Accountant. She joined the Bank of Canada in 1980 and served in a variety of functions including Comptroller and Chief Accountant, as well as Internal Auditor, before being appointed Adviser in 1992. She has also been active on board committees of the Society of Management Accountants of Ontario and the Financial Management Institute of Canada (Capital Chapter).
""I'm looking forward to becoming involved with the CPA at a time of exciting developments in the payments field, including new legislation containing the most significant changes for the association since its creation 20 years ago,"" commented Mrs. Cosier. ""Millions of transactions conducted by Canadians each day rely on the safety and efficiency of the payments system operated by the CPA. I look forward to working with CPA members and stakeholders to help ensure that Canada continues to have a world-class payments system.""
The CPA is a non-profit association created by an Act of Parliament in 1980. Its mandate is to operate a national clearing and settlement system and plan the evolution of the national payments system. Its current membership includes almost all of Canada's bank and non-bank deposit-taking financial institutions. Proposed legislation will extend eligibility for membership to life insurance companies, securities dealers, and money-market mutual funds. CPA systems now settle transactions totalling $120 billion per day on average.
Mrs. Cosier succeeds Serge Vachon, Adviser to the Governor, who served in the position from the creation of the CPA 20 years ago until he stepped down at the end of 2000. Mr. Vachon will be retiring from the Bank of Canada at the end of March 2001. Mrs. Cosier would like to convey the appreciation of the CPA for the leadership that Mr. Vachon provided during his tenure as Chair."
David Dodge Appointed Governor of the Bank of Canada,2000-12-20,"The Board of Directors of the Bank of Canada announced today that, pursuant to  Section 6 of the Bank of Canada Act, it has appointed David Dodge as Governor of  the Bank of Canada for a seven-year term, effective 1 February 2001. He will  succeed Gordon Thiessen, who announced earlier this year that he would retire  from the Bank at the end of his term on 31 January 2001.
""David Dodge brings to his new role distinguished academic credentials and an  exemplary record of public service,"" said Harold MacKay, Chair of the Special  Committee of the Board of Directors. ""The Board believes that Mr. Dodge is  superbly equipped to lead the Bank and that he will serve both the Bank and  Canadians very well.""
A native of Toronto, Mr. Dodge received a bachelor's degree (honours) in  economics from Queen's University and a PhD in economics from Princeton (1972).
During his academic career he has served as Assistant Professor of Economics  at Queen's University; Associate Professor of Canadian Studies and International  Economics at the School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins  University; Senior Fellow in the Faculty of Commerce at the University of  British Columbia; and Visiting Professor in the Department of Economics at Simon  Fraser University. He has also served as Director of the International Economics  Program of the Institute on Research in Public Policy.
During a distinguished career in the federal public service, Mr. Dodge has  held senior positions in the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the  Anti-Inflation Board, and the Department of Employment and Immigration. After  serving in a number of increasingly senior positions at the Department of  Finance, including that of G-7 Deputy, Mr. Dodge was appointed Deputy Minister  of Finance in 1992. In that role, he served as a member of the Bank's Board of  Directors until 1997. He was appointed to his current position, Deputy Minister  of Health Canada, in 1998.
On behalf of the Board of Directors, Mr. MacKay wished Mr. Thiessen well in  his retirement after 35 years of dedicated service to the Bank."
Bank of Canada keeps Bank Rate at 6 per cent,2000-12-05,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining the Bank Rate at 6 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank's target for the overnight rate remains at 5 3/4 per cent.
In making this decision, the Bank took into account a number of factors bearing on the future trend of inflation.
Economic data continue to indicate that the rate of expansion of output is above the Canadian economy's long-run growth potential. While external demand for Canadian products has moderated, reflecting the recent slowing in the United States economy, growth in domestic demand remains robust.
The latest information on consumer price inflation was broadly in line with the Bank's expectations. In October, core inflation moved up slightly to 1.5 per cent, remaining in the lower half of the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control target range. The rate of increase in the total consumer price index remained close to the top end of the target range, reflecting the sharp increase in energy prices over the past year.
Monetary conditions have supported the growth of aggregate demand, and pressures on the economy's production capacity are expected to increase. At the same time, as pointed out in the November Monetary Policy Report, the economy's ability to expand without generating rising inflationary pressures could be greater than estimated. Accordingly, the Bank will continue to assess carefully the balance of aggregate demand and supply in the economy and the risks to the future trend of inflation.
The Bank will also pay close attention to any signs that higher energy prices are being passed through to other prices in the economy and to inflation expectations, as well as to any potential inflationary effect from the lower Canadian dollar.
In the Bank's judgment, the factors at work in the economy point to core inflation rising to the midpoint of the target range over the coming year.
The next scheduled date for a Bank Rate announcement is 23 January 2001. The Monetary Policy Report Update will be published on 6 February 2001."
Bank of Canada releases dates for announcing Bank Rate actions,2000-10-30,"The Bank of Canada today made public the dates through the year 2001 on which it will announce any changes to the official interest rate it uses to implement monetary policy. Last month the Bank outlined its plan to adopt a new system of pre-set or ""fixed"" dates for announcing changes to the Bank Rate, which will replace the previous approach under which it could announce an adjustment on any business day in the year.
In releasing the dates, the Bank also confirmed that interest rate announcements will be made on Tuesdays at 9 a.m. (ET) and made available a calendar showing how the schedule of announcement dates will be integrated with the Bank's other key monetary policy publications throughout the year to provide a more regular, frequent, and continuous process of public communication on monetary policy. The Bank would still have the option of acting between fixed dates, but would exercise this option only in extraordinary circumstances.
The schedule of announcement dates from December 2000 through 2001 is:
The decision to schedule the announcements on Tuesdays at 9 a.m. was made following analysis of all relevant considerations, including the views of financial market participants and interested individuals submitted during public consultation on the new approach. (A summary of the results of the consultation process is available on the Bank Web site.)
""We wish to thank all those who provided views on details of the Bank's proposed plan,"" said Bank Governor Gordon Thiessen. ""With the benefit of these views, I am confident that the Bank's decision to implement pre-set announcement dates for Bank Rate changes will contribute to the improved functioning of financial markets, better public understanding of the factors affecting the Bank's decisions on interest rates, and more effective Canadian monetary policy.""
The Bank clarified a number of communications issues related to the implementation of fixed announcement dates:
An announcement on each fixed date
At 9 a.m. on each announcement date, the Bank will issue a press release indicating its decision either to change the Bank Rate or to leave it unchanged, together with a short explanation of the factors influencing the decision and the Bank's view of the risks in the period ahead. Prompt dissemination of the information in the press release will be facilitated by a lock-up at the Bank for accredited media just prior to 9 a.m. The press release will be posted on the Bank's Web site and distributed nationally via Canada News Wire. The Bank will continue to post interest rate information on the Bank of Canada pages of Bridge, Reuters and Bloomberg financial wire services.
Publication of Extracts from the Minutes of the Board of Directors' Meeting to be discontinued 
The implementation of fixed announcement dates will create eight new announcements a year that will be integrated with the Bank's other key monetary policy publications, such as the semi-annual Monetary Policy Report and the semi-annual Monetary Policy Report Update, and with speeches and other public pronouncements by the Governor and other members of the Governing Council. The purpose is to provide a more regular, frequent, and continuous process of public communication on the Canadian economic and financial situation and its implications for monetary policy. In the context of this more frequent and forward-looking calendar of public communications, publication of the Extracts from the Minutes of the Board of Directors' Meeting, which reports on the Bank's economic and financial briefings to the Board at its previous meeting, would be dated and redundant. Therefore, following their release in early November, the Bank will discontinue publishing the Extracts. 1
Calendar of monetary policy announcements and publications"
Bank of Canada to issue new bank notes,2000-09-26,"The Bank of Canada will issue a new series of bank notes beginning in January  2001 to further enhance the security of Canada's currency.
The new series of bank notes will contain sophisticated security features  designed to thwart counterfeiters. Although counterfeiting of Canadian bank  notes remains at low levels, last year it cost Canadians more than $4 million  dollars.
The last Canadian note series was introduced 15 years ago. Significant  technological advances in bank note production since then have made it possible  for the Bank to incorporate better security features into paper currency. This  comes at a time when affordable high-resolution colour copiers, inkjet printers,  and computer scanners have increased the potential for counterfeiting.
""The new notes will incorporate state-of-the-art security features that will  make Canadian bank notes even more secure than they are now. Each new series  contains more sophisticated security features to protect Canadians from the risk  of receiving counterfeit notes,"" said Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen.  ""Canadians should also know that they will be able to hold and use existing  notes for as long as they want; the current notes will remain legal tender even  after the new notes are introduced.""
A major enhancement to the new series is the addition of a tactile feature  that will greatly improve the ability of the blind and vision impaired to  recognize different denominations.
""We are proud that Canada is one of the first countries in the world to add a  durable tactile feature to its notes,"" said Vangelis Nikias of the Canadian  National Institute for the Blind. ""When the Bank of Canada began the process of  developing the new notes, there was a concerted effort to take into  consideration the real needs of blind and vision-impaired Canadians.""
The Bank has been consulting with Canadians across the country to ensure that  the new designs reflect Canada's culture, history, and achievements. The results  of that extensive national consultation have been reflected in the selection of  subject matter that will be incorporated into the new note designs.
The subject matter approved by the Minister of Finance for the new notes will  be announced in November.
The Bank has been working with financial institutions and equipment  manufacturers to ensure that the introduction of the new notes will not require  major changes to note-handling facilities and equipment.
Although the current images will change, the new notes will be the same size,  and the existing dominant colours on each denomination will be maintained. In  addition, the Queen and the Prime Ministers currently featured on the notes will  remain on the same denominations but there will be new portraits.
With the introduction of the new bank notes, the Bank of Canada will also be  intensifying its educational and awareness programs. These programs provide  information on currency and counterfeit detection to cash handlers, law  enforcement agencies and the general public.
""One of the most effective ways to reduce counterfeiting is to have a  well-informed public, especially those individuals who work with cash,"" said  Gilbert Marois, Assistant Director of Currency Education at the Bank of  Canada.
The first redesigned note, the $10 denomination, will be put into circulation  in January 2001. The new series will include a $5 note that will be issued later  in 2001, and the remaining new notes ($20, $50, and $100) will be introduced  over the next two to three years.
A $1000 note will not be issued. In May 2000, the Bank of Canada began the  withdrawal of $1000 notes as part of the federal government's fight against  money laundering and organized crime."
Bank of Canada to adopt fixed dates for announcing Bank Rate changes,2000-09-19,"The Bank of Canada today outlined details of its plan to adopt a system of eight ""fixed"" or pre-specified dates each year for announcing any changes to the official interest rate it uses to implement monetary policy—the rate of interest it charges on short-term loans to financial institutions. The new system will replace the current approach to announcing changes to the Bank Rate under which the Bank can, in principle, announce an adjustment on any business day in the year.
In releasing the details of the plan, the Bank said that adopting fixed announcement dates will improve the implementation and effectiveness of Canadian monetary policy.
The basic features of the new approach are:
Following consultation with interested Canadians on the implementation of this approach, the Bank will make public, in late October, the specific announcement dates through to the end of 2001. The new system of fixed announcement dates will go into effect in November 2000.
The Bank expects that there will be a number of benefits from fixed announcement dates that will make monetary policy more effective. In particular, fixed dates will reduce uncertainty in financial markets associated with not knowing exactly when the Bank might announce an interest rate change. They should also focus greater attention on the economic and monetary situation in Canada; put greater emphasis on the medium-term perspective that underlies monetary policy; and increase the Bank's transparency, accountability, and ongoing dialogue with the public. Together, these improvements should contribute to better public understanding of the factors influencing monetary policy and increase the public's ability to anticipate the direction of policy.
Under the new approach, the Bank would still have the option of acting between fixed announcement dates, but it would exercise this option only in the event of extraordinary circumstances.
By adopting fixed announcement dates, the Bank of Canada will join many other central banks in the industrialized countries, including the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Swedish Riksbank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, all of which use a fixed-date approach to announcing interest rate changes."
Bank of Canada Raises Target Overnight Rate by ½ Percentage Point to 5¾ Per Cent,2000-05-17,"The Bank of Canada raised its target for the overnight rate by one-half of one percentage point to 5¾ per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate was correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 6 per cent.
In its latest Monetary Policy Report, released last week, the Bank took note of the strength of demand in Canada from both international and domestic sources, some early signs of pressures on capacity limits, and the need to lean against these trends in order to preserve the low and stable inflation environment that has been benefiting the Canadian economy.
An important source of this strong growth in demand has been the U.S. economy. Yesterday’s action by the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise its target level for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points underscores the strength of that economy and the continued risk of demand and inflation pressures spilling over from the United States into Canada.
This move by the Bank of Canada reflects the judgment that a tightening in monetary conditions in Canada is warranted, given that the underlying momentum of demand growth and the high levels of activity risk putting excessive pressure on the economy’s capacity limits, and thus on inflation.
It is through the Bank’s commitment to a low and stable inflation environment that monetary policy can best contribute to sustained economic expansion in Canada, which will increase the likelihood of lower unemployment and improved productivity."
Bank Rate Raised by ¼ Percentage Point to 5½ Per Cent,2000-03-22,"The Bank of Canada raised its Bank Rate today by ¼ of one percentage point to 5½ per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate was correspondingly increased, and the Bank's target for the overnight rate is now 5¼ per cent.
This increase in interest rates by the Bank of Canada follows the decision yesterday by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board to raise its target level for the federal funds rate to 6 per cent. In announcing its decision, the Federal Reserve expressed further concern that increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth of the U.S. economy's production capacity, posing inflation risks.
Strong U.S. demand has been benefiting the Canadian export sector. Increased export sales, together with the robust momentum of domestic spending in Canada, have led to a more rapid economic expansion than expected. While the core measure of Canadian inflation remains in the lower half of the Bank's inflation-control target range of 1 to 3 per cent, the strengthening pace of economic expansion has been rapidly absorbing production capacity and runs the risk of putting excessive pressure on capacity limits. In addition, the recent sharp rise in energy prices has pushed the increase in the total CPI to 2.7 per cent and is adding to input costs for other products.
This adjustment in the Bank Rate is designed to resist any tendency for these developments to lead to an increase in the trend of inflation in Canada.
It is by taking timely action, as required, to keep future inflation inside the 1 to 3 per cent target range that the Bank of Canada can help to ensure a sustainable expansion of economic activity and employment."
Bank Rate Raised by 1/4 Percentage Point to 5 1/4 Per Cent,2000-02-03,"The Bank of Canada raised its Bank Rate today by ¼ of one percentage point to 5¼ per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate was correspondingly increased, and the Bank's target for the overnight rate is now 5 per cent.
This increase in interest rates by the Bank, which follows the decision yesterday by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board to raise its target level for the federal funds rate to 5¾ per cent, is designed to keep the future trend of inflation well inside the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent target range so that the Canadian economy can continue to expand in a sustainable way.
The factors behind this decision include the strong momentum of demand in the Canadian economy from both external and domestic sources, the importance of approaching the economy's full capacity in a prudent way, and the risk of a spillover of potential inflation pressures from the United States into Canada.
U.S. economic and financial developments have an important impact on Canada, and the Bank gives full and careful consideration to that influence. Decisions by the Bank, however, are always taken on the basis of what is considered appropriate for the situation in Canada.
The Bank will be issuing an Update to its November Monetary Policy Report in two weeks. That Update, to be included in the Bank of Canada's Winter Review, will provide a current assessment of the trends in the economy."
Bank Rate Raised by ¼ Percentage Point to 5 Per Cent,1999-11-17,"The Bank of Canada today raised its Bank Rate by ¼ of one percentage point to 5 per cent. The operating band for overnight interest rates was correspondingly increased, and the Bank's target for the overnight rate is now 4¾ per cent.
This action follows the decision yesterday by the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise its target level for the federal funds rate to 5½ per cent. The Federal Reserve indicated that the expansion of activity in the U.S. economy continues in excess of its growth potential and expressed concern about the inflation risk.
Given the implications of U.S. economic and financial developments for Canada, together with the recent evidence of robust domestic demand growth, this increase in interest rates by the Bank is designed to keep inflation well within the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent target range. In this way monetary policy continues to support a sustainable rate of growth in output and employment in Canada.
The Bank's November Monetary Policy Report, to be published today, describes in detail the Bank's assessment of the trends in the economy over the next 18 months and the importance of taking timely action to preserve Canada's low inflation environment."
Bank Rate Lowered by ¼ Percentage Point to 4¾ Per Cent,1999-05-04,"The Bank of Canada today lowered its Bank Rate by ¼ of one per cent to 4¾ per cent. The associated operating band for overnight interest rates was similarly reduced. The Bank's target for the overnight rate is now 4½ per cent, the centre of the new operating band.
The situation in international financial markets has improved considerably in recent months; however, there are still significant uncertainties facing the global economy. Economic growth in the United States continues to exceed expectations, but price and cost pressures in the U.S. economy continue to be contained by productivity gains and a competitive global environment. Inflation remains subdued worldwide.
In Canada, economic activity has been showing signs of increased upward momentum, and domestic financial markets have taken a more positive tone. At the same time, the trend of inflation has remained at the lower end of the Bank of Canada's 1 to 3 per cent target range.
Given the economic and financial backdrop, this interest rate reduction by the Bank will help to provide monetary conditions that would support continued economic expansion and keep the trend of inflation comfortably inside the target range next year."
Bank Rate Lowered by ¼ Percentage Point to 5 Per Cent,1999-03-31,"The Bank of Canada today lowered its Bank Rate by ¼ of one per cent to 5 per cent. The associated operating band for overnight interest rates was similarly reduced. The Bank's target for the overnight rate is now 4¾ per cent, the centre of the new operating band.
Today's interest rate reduction was taken in the context of continued improvement in global financial markets and recent evidence that the trend rate of inflation in Canada is close to the lower end of the Bank's target range of 1 to 3 per cent.
This action by the Bank of Canada, along with three similar reductions in September, October, and November, completely reverses the one percentage point increase in short-term interest rates that was needed to bolster investor confidence last August, at a time of nervous and volatile international markets.
This final step in unwinding the interest rate increase of last August is also consistent with keeping the trend rate of inflation inside the target range. Notwithstanding the recent good set of economic indicators, the competitive global environment and the absence of any signs of pressure on domestic production capacity point to continued low inflation in Canada. The Bank's semi-annual Monetary Policy Report, which will be released in mid-May, will present a full analysis of the outlook for inflation.
With the introduction on 4 February of the new Large Value Transfer System for making large value payments, the implementation of monetary policy has changed slightly. There is still an operating band of ½ of one percentage point for the overnight rate. The top of the band, the Bank Rate, is the rate charged by the Bank on LVTS overdraft loans to financial institutions. The bottom of the band is the interest rate the Bank of Canada pays on any LVTS balances held overnight by those institutions. The Bank has a target for the overnight rate, which has been set at the centre of the operating band.
With the interest rate reduction announced today, the operating band has been reduced by ¼ of one percentage point to a new range of 4½ to 5 per cent. The Bank's target rate for the overnight rate is 4¾ per cent.
It is through the market for overnight funds that monetary policy exerts a direct effect on financial markets generally."
Bank of Canada Welcomes Canada's New Funds Transfer System,1999-01-28,"The Bank of Canada today welcomed the announcement by the Canadian Payments  Association that full operation of the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) will  begin on 4 February 1999. The LVTS is a major milestone in the reduction of risk  in Canada's payment system and will bring Canada into line with international  best practices for handling large-value payments.
The LVTS is a real-time system designed to handle large-value or  time-critical payments. It will form the core of the national payment system and  will substantially reduce systemic risk. Systemic risk refers to the risk of  domino or spillover effects that could arise if one financial institution is  unable to fulfil its payment obligations in a timely fashion. This could lead to  other financial institutions being unable to fulfil their obligations in the  payments system or elsewhere in the financial system.
The Bank of Canada worked closely with the Canadian Payments Association and  its members in ensuring that sound risk containment mechanisms were incorporated  into the LVTS. The new system provides its participants and their customers with  the certainty that once a payment message has passed the system's risk-control  tests, the transaction will settle on the books of the Bank of Canada on the  same day regardless of what happens to any of the participants subsequently. As  a result, LVTS participants will be able to offer to their customers  unconditional and irrevocable intra-day access to funds received over the LVTS.  This contrasts with the current arrangements where final settlement of payment  obligations among financial institutions does not occur until around noon on the  following business day and where payment transactions could be unwound if a  participant were to fail.
The LVTS will be particularly helpful for settling Canadian-dollar payment  obligations arising from securities transactions or foreign exchange  transactions. The real- time certainty of settlement of large-value Canadian  dollar payment messages provided by the LVTS will minimize settlement risk  associated with these types of transactions. The LVTS will also permit the  Canadian dollar to be included in cross-border multicurrency clearing and  settlement systems.
Under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act (which came into force in July  1996), the Bank of Canada is responsible for the formal oversight of clearing  and settlement systems for the purpose of controlling systemic risk. The LVTS  has been designated as being subject to the Act and will be subject to ongoing  regulatory oversight by the Bank with regard to its risk-containment  arrangements.
The introduction of the LVTS will require changes in the way that the Bank of  Canada implements monetary policy, although it will not alter the Bank's basic  approach to policy. The key feature of the modified framework will continue to  be an operating band of 50 basis points for the overnight interest rate.  However, the limits for the band will be enforced differently.
For information on how the Bank intends to implement monetary policy  on a daily basis, see:

Bank of Canada Governor Addresses Canadian Club of Ottawa,1999-01-20,"Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen today reviewed the economic implications  of the European currency union and its lessons for Canada. Mr. Thiessen's remarks came in a speech to the Canadian Club of Ottawa.
Calling the launch of the euro as the new common currency of 11 European  countries ""an economic event of historic proportions,"" Mr. Thiessen described  the relatively smooth transition to the euro as ""a major political,  administrative, and technical feat.""
Mr. Thiessen said an understanding of European monetary union had to begin  with the profound political impetus towards economic integration in the years  immediately following World War II. He noted that ""had this been a strictly  economic initiative, it might not have materialized.""
The main economic benefits of the common currency are eliminating the costs  of converting currencies and removing the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.  The main cost is that countries can no longer pursue an independent monetary  policy and can ""no longer benefit from having their national currency operate as  a buffer in the event of an economic shock.""
""The economic case for a common currency in Europe,"" said Governor Thiessen,  ""rests on a judgment that buffering differential shocks in the partner countries  will be a less important consideration than the benefits from lower transaction  costs and the greater economic certainty because of reduced currency risk. This  presumes that the economic structures of these countries are sufficiently alike  that any shocks will be felt by all of them at roughly the same time and to a  similar degree.""
Turning to the implications of the euro for Canada, the Governor said the  direct effects will be limited since Euroland accounts for just 4 per cent of  Canadian exports and 7 per cent of Canadian imports.
However, the launch of the new euro has piqued public interest in Canada  about a North American monetary union. Mr. Thiessen noted the decline in the  external value of the Canadian dollar over the past year ""has, no doubt,  heightened interest in the issue.""
Mr. Thiessen underlined that, for several reasons, ""the euro is not a  blueprint for a North American monetary union."" He noted that in North America,  ""there are no parallels to the profound political forces"" underlying the move to  greater integration in Europe.
Mr. Thiessen said a monetary union in North America would not be like that in  Europe where there are three large partners and eight other medium- and  smaller-size participants. He said any North American monetary arrangement would  ""likely mean that Canada would have to adopt the U.S. currency.""
Mr. Thiessen added that, for Canada, the major problem with a single North  American currency is that Canada would be giving up the buffer that a flexible  exchange rate offers in dealing with economic shocks that affect us differently  from the United States.
""An important contrast between Canada and the United States is the distinctly  different impact that fluctuations in the world prices of primary commodities  have on our two economies,"" Mr. Thiessen said. The decline in world commodity  prices over the past two years has meant that Canada is relatively less well  off.
""That is reality,"" said Mr. Thiessen, ""and we have to adjust to it, whether  we are on a floating or fixed exchange rate or even in a currency union."" If the  exchange rate is not allowed to move, then ""the adjustment would have to take  place primarily through declines in prices and wages and the movement of labour  and capital. And if those did not readily occur, the adjustment would take  longer and cost more in terms of losses in output and employment.""
The Governor concluded that there is a tendency in Canada to blame movements  in the Canadian dollar that reflect economic shocks as ""the cause of our  problems. In fact, these currency movements are a consequence, not a cause.  Exchange rate flexibility has served us well over time. Why would we want to  give it up?"""
Bank Rate Lowered by ¼ Percentage Point to 5¼ Per Cent,1998-11-18,"The Bank of Canada today lowered its Bank Rate by ¼ of one percentage point to 5¼ per cent. The Bank's operating band for the overnight rate was similarly adjusted to a range of 4¾ to 5¼ per cent.
This decrease in short-term interest rates follows the move yesterday by the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower the federal funds rate by ¼ of one percentage point to 4¾ per cent.
With the support that this move by the Federal Reserve provides to help stabilize financial markets in the United States and abroad, and given low and stable inflation in Canada, the Bank judged that a similar ¼ of one percentage point decline in Canadian short-term interest rates was appropriate."
Government of Canada Pilot Bond Buyback Program Launch: Operational Framework,1998-11-05,"On behalf of the Minister of Finance, the Bank of Canada announced today the  operational framework for the previously announced pilot bond buyback program.  The program is designed to support the maintenance of a liquid Government of  Canada new issue bond market through the repurchase of less liquid outstanding  bonds and the issuance of replacement current benchmark bonds. Design of the  operational framework is based on extensive consultations with market  participants. The pilot program will run through the remainder of the 1998-99  fiscal year.
Bond buyback operations will be conducted through purchases on behalf of the  government by the Bank of Canada, in the period up to seven days following  selected bond auctions. Planned buyback transactions will be announced at the  same time as bond auction sizes are announced. Specific bonds targeted for  repurchase will be identified, and will be within a range of maturities close to  the auction maturity. The maximum size for the operation will also be  announced.
The Bank of Canada will accept offers to sell the listed bonds up to 12:30  p.m. on the day of operation. Government Securities Distributors (GSD) are  eligible to participate in the buyback program. To minimize turnaround time for  processing offers, a maximum of three offers per targeted bond will be accepted  from each GSD.
For the pilot program, the following bonds will not be eligible for  repurchase: the current benchmark bond, and the two preceding benchmark bonds at  each maturity as well as bonds in the CGB and CGF futures deliverable baskets.  Buyback transactions will be settled on a cash basis, with settlement based on  market convention. The repurchased bonds will subsequently be cancelled.
Every effort will be made to announce the results of the buyback operation no  later than one hour after the bidding period ends. The results will include the  amount of each bond bought back, the new outstanding amount for the repurchased  bonds and the cut-off yield for each repurchased bond."
Bank Rate Lowered by ¼ Percentage Point to 5½ Per Cent,1998-10-16,"The Bank of Canada today lowered its Bank Rate by ¼ of one percentage point to 5½ per cent. The Bank's operating band for the overnight rate was similarly adjusted to a range of 5 to 5½ per cent.
This decrease in short-term interest rates follows yesterday's move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower the federal funds rate by ¼ of one percentage point to 5 per cent. The action by the Federal Reserve was taken to sustain economic growth against a backdrop of growing caution by U.S. lenders and unsettled conditions in financial markets more generally.
Given the implications of these U.S. economic and financial market developments, and in the context of low and stable inflation in Canada, a similar ¼ of one percentage point decline in Canadian short-term interest rates was judged appropriate."
Bank Rate Lowered by ¼ Percentage Point to 5¾ Per Cent,1998-09-29,"The Bank of Canada today lowered its Bank Rate by ¼ of one percentage point to 5¾ per cent. The Bank's operating band for the overnight rate was similarly adjusted to a range of 5¼ to 5¾ per cent.
This decrease in short-term interest rates follows today's move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower the federal funds rate by ¼ of one percentage point to 5¼ per cent. The action by the Federal Reserve was taken to cushion the effects on the U.S. economy of international developments and domestic financial conditions. The implications of these international and U.S. developments, as well as Canada's good underlying inflation performance, warrant a reduction in Canadian short-term interest rates.
Since late August there has been an increase in confidence in Canadian financial markets with a firmer Canadian dollar and lower medium- and long-term interest rates. These developments have also contributed to the expectations in financial markets of a decline in overnight interest rates."
Changes to Government of Canada auction process to take effect 14 October 1998,1998-09-28,"On behalf of the Minister of Finance, the Bank of Canada announced today that  ""Revised rules pertaining to auctions of Government of Canada securities and the Bank of Canada\'s surveillance of the auction process,"" released 11 August 1998, will take effect on 14 October  1998.
Revisions to the auction rules, affecting the primary market in Government of  Canada securities, were developed in extensive consultation with market  participants. These changes are designed to reinforce the integrity of the  auction process and to encourage broad participation in it. The Investment  Dealers Association, in consultation with the government, has developed a code  of conduct—IDA Policy No. 5—to reinforce the integrity of the secondary market.  These initiatives are linked through the new terms of participation in auctions  for government securities distributors and for customers.
Under the new rules, there will be 25 government securities distributors,  including 15 primary dealers, eligible to submit bids directly in auctions of  Government of Canada securities.
Coincident with the implementation of the new auction rules, the Bank of  Canada will introduce a new system, the Communications, Auctions and Reporting  System (CARS). This system will be used for tendering and processing Government  of Canada treasury bill, bond, and Receiver General Term Deposit auctions.
Copies of the revised rules, the terms of participation, and applications for  customer bidding identification numbers are available on the Bank of Canada's  Web site, or from Bank of Canada Publications Distribution at (613) 782-8248. IDA Policy  No. 5 is also available on the Bank of Canada's Web site."

Bank Rate Raised by 1 Percentage Point,1998-08-27,"The Bank of Canada today raised its Bank Rate by one percentage point to 6 per cent. The Bank's operating band for the overnight rate was similarly adjusted to a range of 5½ to 6 per cent.
Today's increase in interest rates is aimed at providing support for the Canadian dollar in order to bolster confidence, while preserving monetary conditions that will help to sustain the present non-inflationary expansion of the economy.
For some time now, the Canadian dollar has been under persistent downward pressure. In part, this has reflected an adjustment to increased economic uncertainty in Asia, the associated downward pressure on the prices of the primary commodities that Canada exports, and the developing problems in Russia. However, the currency decline has more recently developed a momentum that, together with the upper pressure on medium- and longer-term interest rates, signals a diminishing of confidence in Canadian dollar investments. At the same time, the depreciation of the currency has resulted in a substantial easing of monetary conditions. While some of this easing has been warranted by economic developments, it is the Bank's view that it has become excessive.
The crucial economic trends in Canada remain positive, supported by a low inflation environment, a declining public sector debt-to-GDP ratio and strong private sector investment. Even in the face of an uncertain international economic environment, the Canadian economy continues to expand at a solid underlying pace, spurred by consumer and investment spending in Canada and by the high level of domestic demand in the United States."
Bank Rate Raised to 5 Per Cent,1998-01-30,"The Bank of Canada today raised its Bank Rate by ½ of one percentage point to 5 per cent. The Bank's operating band for the overnight rate was similarly adjusted to a range of 4½ to 5 per cent.
Downward pressure on the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar has intensified in recent days, leaving the dollar at levels inconsistent with the underlying trends of the Canadian economy. Although problems in Asia are likely to moderate the pace of economic activity in 1998, the outlook is still for solid expansion in output and employment that will continue to reduce the slack in the Canadian economy. In these circumstances, the extent of the significant further easing of monetary conditions due to the recent decline in the Canadian dollar is not appropriate. This adjustment in the Bank Rate is designed to rebalance monetary conditions and provide support for the Canadian dollar."
Bank Rate Raised to 4 1/2 Per Cent,1997-12-12,"The Bank of Canada today raised its Bank rate by ½ of one percentage point to 4 ½ per cent. The Bank's operating band for the overnight rate was similarly adjusted.
Volatility in international financial markets, tied to events in Asia, has continued to affect Canadian markets. This action by the Bank is designed to contribute to more settled domestic markets in which investors can focus more confidently on the strong fundamentals favouring non-inflationary growth in the Canadian economy."
Bank Rate Raised in Response to Persistent Weakness in the Canadian Dollar,1997-11-25,"The Bank of Canada today raised the Bank Rate by 1/4 of one percentage point to 4 per cent. The Bank's operating band for the overnight rate was similarly adjusted.
Persistent weakness in the Canadian dollar since late October has resulted in a further easing in monetary conditions that were already highly stimulative. Given the underlying strength in the Canadian economy and the aim of having monetary conditions that support a long-lasting expansion, this further easing is inappropriate. Currency weakness may also put at risk the sustainability of the low level of Canadian medium-and longer-term interest rates compared to those in the United States.
This action is designed to counter the excessive easing in monetary conditions and to provide support for the Canadian dollar."
Bank Rate Raised by ¼ Percentage Point,1997-10-01,"The Bank of Canada today raised the Bank Rate and its operating band for the overnight rate by 1/4 of one percentage point. The new Bank Rate is 3 3/4 per cent and the operating band is 3 1/4 to 3 3/4 per cent.
In recent months there has been growing evidence that the Canadian economy is expanding rapidly and absorbing unused capacity. Indicators of aggregate demand, output, and money supply growth have all been strong.
The gathering momentum now evident in the economy has occurred largely as a result of the substantial monetary support that has been provided to offset the effects associated with private and public sector restructuring.
Given the lags between monetary policy actions and their effect on the economy, timely action to moderate the extent of monetary stimulus will contribute to making the economic expansion long lasting. Canadian interest rates remain below those in the United States, and monetary conditions continue to support economic growth with low inflation."
