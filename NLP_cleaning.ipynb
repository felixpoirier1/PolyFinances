This research seminar is part of the Federal Reserve\\'s series of events called \"Toward an Inclusive Recovery.\"\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nToday\\'s seminar, hosted by the Board of Governors, will focus on how the COVID-19 pandemic affected educational outcomes and the subsequent impact we anticipate for transitions to the labor force. We have invited accomplished researchers to discuss their workâ\\x80\\x94and what practical lessons might be drawn from itâ\\x80\\x94that could help inform community development practice and public policy considerations.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nAs I am sure you are aware, the pandemic created significant disruptions for our students and the education system. At the onset of the pandemic, steps taken to slow the spread of COVID-19 resulted in widespread closures of businesses and schools. Many, myself included, were immediately concerned about the negative effects on education from changes that included shifting to virtual instruction, lack of access to technology, and changes to the accessibility and provision of childcare. It is critical to consider that access to education at every step along a student\\'s learning path serves as a pipeline into the labor force and enables future generations of Americans to participate and thrive in our dynamic labor market. The disruption of education throughout the pandemic undoubtedly led to an absence of workers in the labor force, creating a shortage that held back the early economic recovery.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nEducation outcomes, including learning losses and achievements, take time to measure, aggregate, and analyze. As we enter the fourth academic year affected by the pandemic, data on student performance are becoming more available. Much of this early data confirms our initial concerns. For example, early test scores show that throughout the country nine-year-olds suffered a decline in learning outcomes during the pandemic. But other data also indicate that learning losses were unequal and disproportionately affected low-performing students and low-income students.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIt is likely that the sudden shift to online classes contributed to the learning declines. According to the Board\\'s 2020 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (the SHED), only 22 percent of parents with children attending virtual classes agreed that their children learned as much as they would have attending classes in person at school. I hope that the return to in-person learning and reopening of schools will enable children to resume normal learning and that academic achievement will rebound.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIt seems that even with this return to in-person attendance, many schools are struggling to provide students with the same quality of education as they did pre-pandemic. With the return to onsite education, many schools are confronting challenges that impair their ability to meet the educational needs of students. A number of educators appear to have left the profession, as indicated by the nearly 100,000 more job openings for teachers in July 2022 than before the pandemic.1\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nComplicating these issues, across the country the return to in-person instruction has been met by an increase in chronic absenteeism, which is defined as a student missing at least 10 percent of school days in a school year. Compared to a typical school year pre-pandemic, 72 percent of U.S. public schools reported an increase in chronic absenteeism among their students during the 2021â\\x80\\x9322 school year, which is a 39 percent increase over the previous year.2\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nMissed school typically means missed learning, so chronic absenteeism is a key metric of school performance. It\\'s likely that these challenges will result in lower graduation rates and possibly less stable employment than would have otherwise been the case.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThese outcomes raise difficult questions about how to best respond to the needs of students and educators going forward. For example, how can curricula be adjusted to meet students where they are today, after nearly three years of pandemic-impacted learning? How can we best re-engage the larger proportion of students who may have become disconnected as a result of these pandemic-related disruptions to their education? What does this all mean for the future of the labor force?\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIn addition to the challenges facing primary and secondary education, higher education was not immune to pandemic disruptions. Like K-12 education, studies show that online instruction reduced the academic performance of college students.3 In addition, we have seen declines in both college enrollment and the rate of first-year college students who continue their education into a second year.4 These declines are most pronounced at community colleges and open-access programs. Some of this decline was due to a supply-induced shortage resulting from colleges unable to offer remote learning options for many technical and vocational programs. The reduction in these \"hands-on\" programs, such as air-conditioning repair and auto detailing, had a greater impact on male enrollment and may lead to labor supply shortages for some of these skills-based professions.5\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nEducation is the greatest and most effective input into the future of our labor market. In order to have the strongest possible labor force in the future, it is critical to understand and act immediately to address the educational losses experienced during the pandemic. I\\'m sure there\\'s much to learn about how these education challenges, both longstanding and more recent, will ultimately affect the job market. That\\'s a question of particular interest to policymakers, and it\\'s one of the most important reasons that we host events like this seminar. I look forward to hearing from the experts we have invited here today to discuss ideas to successfully and quickly address academic declines, expand K-12 education options, improve higher education outcomes, and prepare this generation to participate and thrive in the future labor force.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551'"

      "text/plain": "'The Transformation of the U.S. Banking Industry and Resulting Challenges to RegulatorsGood morning.  It is a pleasure to be here on Ohio Bankers Day. The over-riding theme of my remarks is the profound transformation the banking industry has undergone over the last 15 years or so and the challenges that these changes pose to bank regulators.  At the end, I hope to have time to take some questions and learn where you think the banking industry is going, and how--consistent with our responsibilities--regulators can promote a more efficient, resilient, and profitable financial services industry.  I plan to learn as much or more from you as you learn from me.The Role of Banks Let me begin with a few observations about the importance of the banking industry in the economy and why banking receives such special attention in terms of regulation. Banks, like other financial intermediaries, pool and absorb risks for depositors and provide stable sources of investment and working capital funds for nonfinancial industries. Banks also provide a unique mix of services among all financial intermediaries, including a \"safe haven\" for small, unsophisticated investors through insured deposits, an important source of funds for small borrowers who often have limited access to other sources of external finance, a smoothly functioning payments system that allows financial and real resources to flow relatively freely to their highest-return uses, a conduit for monetary policy, and a backup source of liquidity for any sector in temporary difficulty through its access to the discount window.Throughout all the changes of the past, and through all the changes to the banking industry in the foreseeable future, banks will continue to perform these important functions, and a goal of bank regulators is to make sure that there is a healthy banking industry to do so.Return to topThe Rationale for Bank Regulation But there are two particularly important characteristics of the banking system that demand our attention as regulators--indeed, are critical to understanding why there are bank regulators.  First, banks have access to a government safety net through deposit insurance, the discount window, and payment system guarantees.  This gives the government a direct stake in keeping bank risks under control, just like a private insurance company has a stake in controlling the risks of policyholders.  Because deposit insurance can never be fully and accurately priced, it is necessary for us to monitor and sometimes to act to control bank risks in order to protect the potential call on taxpayers.  It is also important to understand that an unintended consequence of the safety net is that it creates or augments incentives for some banks to take additional risks.  That is, the safety net creates moral hazard incentives to gamble because the safety net--and potentially taxpayers--may absorb most of the losses if the gamble fails.  Deposit insurance gets in the way of the depositors signaling a bank when it takes excessive risks.The second characteristic of banks that requires the special attention of regulators is that banks are capable of being the conduits of systemic risk and crisis in financial markets.  A breakdown of the payments system or other contagion effect that hampers the ability of banks to intermediate credit flows could have serious adverse consequences for the economy, again requiring the special attention of regulators to bank risks.The challenge is to strike a balance in regulation so that, on the one hand, taxpayers are protected, extensions of the safety net are avoided, and moral hazard incentives are mitigated without, on the other hand, undermining the competitiveness of the banking industry and its ability to take risk, and therefore damaging the entity the regulators are trying to protect.Return to topThe Evolution of Bank Regulation Although this rationale for bank regulation has not changed, in the last decade and a half there has been a significant evolution in approach of regulators toward maintaining the safety and soundness of the banking industry.  From the 1930s through most of the 1970s, regulators focused on keeping the banking industry safe and sound by protecting banks from competition and by limiting the activities in which they could participate.  This meant, for example, prohibiting interstate banking, restricting the rates that banks could pay on deposits, and preventing commercial banks from competing in other product markets, such as investment banking.  During this period, the financial services industry was segmented into separate entities providing commercial banking, investment banking, insurance services, etc.  This separation was largely due to legislative and regulatory decisions.  A consequence of the separation was that firms in each segment of the financial services industry were protected from competition from firms providing the other services.Starting in the late 1970s, the changed economic environment along with advances in technology, financial innovations, and globalization resulted in increased competition to U.S. banks by thrifts, nondepository financial institutions, foreign banks, and the capital markets.  Higher and more variable interest rates, and the accompanying increased yield sensitivity of depositors and borrowers, contributed to the development of money market mutual funds as alternatives to bank deposits and the growth of finance companies and commercial paper as substitutes for bank loans. The increase in external competition brought a swift response from both banks and their regulators.Banks responded to the challenge by expanding in ways that they could, also taking advantage of improvements in technology and applied finance.  They expanded their roles as intermediaries through off-balance-sheet activities such as securitization, back-up lines of credit and derivatives, and, in the process, substituted fee income for some of the interest income lost through competition with other financial intermediaries. In addition, banks sought expanded powers to help them compete, including being able to cross state borders, set their own deposit rates and account types, and--by the late-1980s--expand into securities underwriting activities.Regulators responded to the new environment by reducing the regulatory burden on banks and allowing them to compete on a more level playing field with nonbanking firms.  That is, the new market realities required a reorientation in emphasis from protecting banks from competition to giving banks the opportunity to compete not only with other banks but with nonbank competitors as well.  By allowing banks to enter other states, set their own prices, and engage in other than traditional banking activities, the orientation of regulators evolved toward protecting the safety net while allowing banks to deliver financial services to the public efficiently, profitably, and with sufficient capital to be protected against unforeseen events.Return to topStructural Change in the Banking Industry As a result of this process of structural change, the banking industry of the mid-1990s in many ways hardly resembles that of the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Some of the major changes that I want to focus on are the increased consolidation of the industry, the decline in traditional banking services as a result of increased outside competition, the expansion in bank powers, including the move into nontraditional activities to offset the competition for their traditional products, the increased emphasis on risk management in response to the increased complexity of financial instruments and practices, and the evolution of capital standards and capital positions to keep abreast of the changing risk profiles of banking organization.Consolidation in the banking industry One of the most obvious and dramatic changes is the consolidation of the banking industry. The number of independent banking organizations--by which I mean top-tier holding companies plus unaffiliated banks--has shrunk by more than one-third since the late 1970s, from more than 12,000 to fewer than 8,000.  The percentage of banking assets controlled by organizations with more than $100 billion has about doubled, and is now close to a fifth of all U.S. banking assets, while the percentage of banking assets in banking organizations with less than $100 million in assets has dropped by half, from about 14 percent to 7 percent of industry assets.Much of the consolidation is a direct outgrowth of the removal of geographic restrictions on bank branching and holding company acquisitions by the individual states, a process that is now being extended by the Reagle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branch Efficiency Act of 1994.  This deregulation encourages the banking industry to become more efficient at serving the public’s needs by allowing the efficient competitors to succeed and manage more of the industry’s resources.  The banking industry has also become stronger through the geographic diversification of risks made possible by interstate banking.Importantly, the interstate expansion of large banks does not mean the end of small banks.  Past experience has consistently shown that when large banking organizations enter a new local market by acquisition, the existing small banks that are efficient can compete successfully and maintain their market shares and profitability.  We fully expect thousands of small banks to remain in business even after nationwide branching is fully implemented.The emergence of, and response to, increased outside competition: a decline in traditional banking and the growth of nontraditional activities Over the last 15 years, there has also been a substantial increase in competition to the U.S. banking industry from capital markets, less-regulated domestic financial institutions, and foreign institutions.  As a result, U.S. banks have lost substantial market shares of many of the asset and liability categories that were the mainstay of traditional banking.  However, these declines in market share for banks in traditional product lines do not suggest that the banking industry itself is in decline.  After factoring into the analysis the rapid expansion of nontraditional off-balance-sheet activities, research suggests that the banking industry continues to grow, although not as fast as financial markets as a whole.  The banking industry, for example, has grown at about the same rate as GDP and the new products of the banking industry--such as derivative contracts and other off-balance-sheet activities--have skyrocketed.The most important indicators of whether the banking industry is in decline--measures of financial performance--are even more positive.  The banking industry is profitable, able to raise capital in financial markets, and has a relatively high market-to-book ratio.  These performance indicators also suggest that resources will continue to flow into the industry, rather than out of the industry.  The evidence taken as a whole suggests that the banking industry is weathering the increase in outside competition and is competing well against it.Return to topThe expansion of bank powers The powers of banking organizations also grew dramatically over this time period in two different ways.  First, in the early 1980s, the Monetary Control Act gave banks the right to set their own deposit interest rates and offer new types of accounts, such as household transactions accounts that paid market-based interest rates.Another major way in which banking organization powers expanded over this period was the increase in the number of banking activities permitted to nonbank affiliates of bank holding companies.  Regulators allowed bank holding companies to enter more and more product markets over this time period.  Bank holding companies can now have separately capitalized subsidiaries that offer investment advice, provide discount brokerage services, and underwrite both debt and equity securities, albeit under restricted circumstances.  The market also played a large part in blurring the old distinctions between banks and nonbanks, as other financial services companies began to offer more products with characteristics close to those of bank deposits and loans. Again, the regulatory shift in orientation was in large part a reaction to the market--banks were given more power to compete with nonbanks in part because nonbanks were figuring out better ways to compete against banks.It is also notable that over time banks have taken much greater advantage of the powers they already had.  As I mentioned earlier, banks greatly increased their use of off-balance-sheet guarantees to follow some of their loan customers who chose to borrow their funds elsewhere, and banks were also active players in the new derivative products of the 1980s and 1990s.Increased emphasis on risk management and the growing importance of market risk Despite these many changes, the core business of banking has remained the measurement, acceptance, and management of risk, although a number of important developments over the last 15 to 20 years have improved the abilities of banks to perform these functions.  The most notable developments are in the area of market risks.  Derivative contracts such as futures and swaps are essentially new lines of business for banks in the last decade and a half, which allow banks to measure, accept, and manage market risks to a much greater extent than in the past.In the 1970s, banks primarily measured, accepted, and managed the credit risks of illiquid loans and dealt little with market risks other than minimal asset-liability duration matching.  The rapid developments in market risk tools have facilitated an expansion of the core business of banking to put an increased emphasis on market risks, but banks are nonetheless still primarily in the same core business of measuring, accepting, and managing risks.However, it is important to recognize that having access to improved risk management technologies does not necessarily make banks safer.  Despite the improvements in the abilities of banks to understand and control risks, the risks of the institutions themselves ultimately also depend importantly on the incentives of bank managers and owners to control risks, and on the economic environment in which they operate.  There is little benefit, and perhaps net costs, in having a bank manager know how to measure, accept, and manage risks accurately if this ability is used to take excessive risks that are largely borne by the federal safety net and potentially by taxpayers.  Similarly, when the economic environment turns against bank investments, many banks will become risky and some will fail, even if they have managed their risks fairly well.Return to top    The source of the large number of bank failures in the 1980s and the dramatic improvement in the health of the banking system in the 1990s These caveats are well illustrated by comparing the circumstances of U.S. banks in the 1980s versus the 1990s.  During the 1980s, bank failures were increasing, and by the end of the decade banks were failing at the rate of about 200 per year.  Even greater problems were experienced by the savings and loan industry.  These problems have been largely attributed to two factors.First, when banks or savings and loans get into very low or negative capital positions, the moral hazard problem I discussed earlier may become more severe.  There is a possibility of purposely taking on additional risks to gamble their way out of trouble.  When there is little capital at risk, the owners get much of the benefits if the gamble pays off, and the safety net and taxpayers bear most of the losses if the gamble fails.Second, the 1980s saw a number of turbulent economic changes.  These included fluctuations in interest rates and inflation rates, swings in the prices of commercial real estate and junk bonds that could not be easily forecast, and regional recessions that caused significant numbers of problem loans.  These changes caused damage at many financial institutions, particularly those in geographically undiversified positions without sufficient capital to protect themselves.Given the poor condition of many banks as late as 1991, it is amazing how healthy the banking industry is now, having written off most of its bad assets, raised large amounts of capital, and returned to profitability, likely having its fifth straight year of record profits in 1996.  Bank failures have now retreated to at or near single digits per year.  Clearly, this turnaround is too rapid to be completely accounted for by technical and financial innovations in the measurement, acceptance, and management of risk, or by improvements in the diversification and capitalization of banks.  Changes in attitudes toward risk taking brought about by the higher capital standards and other factors, and changes in the economic environment have also played important roles in the improved health and wealth of the banking industry.The evolution of capital standards and capital positions The final development I will discuss is the evolution of the financial capital positions of U.S. banks, since capital is the cornerstone of defense against bank risks.  Capital serves two functions in this regard.  First, it helps improve the incentives of banks to keep their own risks under control, reducing moral hazard incentives to take those risks that are largely imposed on others. Second, capital is a buffer stock available to absorb risks and economic shocks without creating bankruptcy costs and systemic problems associated with the failure of financial institutions.A goal of capital requirements--along with bank supervision and quality risk management by the banks themselves--is to make the safety net a moot issue for most banks.  That is, by having enough capital available to absorb potential losses and having both the bank and supervisor carefully monitoring and acting to control portfolio risks, the moral hazard incentives of the safety net and the vulnerability of the deposit insurance funds can be kept to a minimum.  It is similarly true that the more we can do to keep risk to the safety net under control using capital and other tools, the more powers we can safely grant to banks without placing undue stress on the safety net or meaningfully expanding safety net protection to other activities.At the end of the 1970s, capital regulation was relatively ad hoc and depended largely on the judgment and discretion of the individual bank’s supervisors.  Starting in 1981, regulations required banks to hold capital equal to a flat percentage of their balance sheet assets.  The next refinement was based on Basle Accord risk-based capital standards--adopted in 1988 and implemented starting in 1990--requiring banks to hold different amounts of capital depending on the perceived credit risk of different on- and off-balance-sheet assets.  In addition, to reduce discretion in the enforcement of the standards and the closure of capital-impaired banks, Congress included \"prompt corrective action\" provisions in the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). Under prompt corrective action, or PCA, banks with capital ratios below certain threshold values are subject to increasingly severe mandatory and discretionary sanctions.  Finally, risk-based capital standards which originally only covered credit risks are now being extended to cover market risks.The process by which the new market risk standards were arrived at is indicative of the new orientation toward incentive-based regulation, allowing well capitalized, efficient banks to compete and imposing costs more selectively on undercapitalized, poorly managed banks.  The standards also permit banks that are more efficient at monitoring and controlling their risks to hold less capital than inefficient banks.  These regulatory standards are much like what the market would do in the absence of the safety net.  The new standards, which apply to banks with substantial trading, allow banks to use their own internal models of risk that are employed in their everyday operations to determine the capital requirements on their trading books.  This approach also reflects a new effort to develop refinements in regulatory standards in cooperation with the industry, in part by better understanding the \"best practices\" that are evolving in the industry and using these as a basis for regulatory standards across the industry.A cumulative effect of the many changes in capital regulation in the 1980s and early 1990s, as well as other factors, is that banks have much higher capital ratios today than they did 15 years ago, and even 5 years ago.  This is especially true at the largest banking organizations.  For the banking industry as a whole, the equity-to-assets ratio rose from less than 6 percent at the end of the 1970s to over 8 percent in the mid-1990s.  For the largest banking organizations, the capital ratio rose from less than 4 percent to over 7 percent.Return to topThe Implications of the Transformation of Banking for Bank Regulation We should not be too sanguine about bank capital, however.  While the current capital standards are significant improvements over what they replaced, they are still based on broad one-size-fits-all rules.  Moreover, the market has begun to focus more on the capital-risk trade-off: no large bank or parent banking organization, for example, has AAA long-term debt, and only a handful are rated AA, despite the capital ratios I just quoted.  Banks at the cutting edge are risk rating their loan portfolios and internally allocating capital to them for management and profitability analysis.  Such allocations are superior ways of developing capital allocation for individual banks. Perhaps we will be able in the future to harness banks’ internal capital allocations for regulatory purposes.  Indeed, the reason for choosing the topics I have discussed thus far is that these structural changes represent an on-going process and are going to continue to challenge us in the future.  In the final portion of my remarks, I will try to identify some of the most important challenges that regulators will face as a result of these changes.Maintaining local competition in the face of continued bank consolidation First, with regard to future banking industry consolidation, the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 essentially expands the existing regional compacts to the nation as a whole, and overturns the McFadden Act prohibition on interstate branching.  Interstate branching to almost all the states is permitted as of June 1, 1997.  The removal of these artificial barriers to trade is beneficial and will likely improve efficiency and diversification of risks in the banking industry.The exact future structure of the banking industry is unknown, but presumably will be driven not just by the removal of legal barriers to competition, but by shifts in technology, efficiency, and risk diversification.  The firms with the greatest managerial efficiencies are expected to take over those with the lowest efficiencies and improve them.  Research in banking suggests that these differences in managerial efficiency are much larger than any scale and scope economies. Various models predict that several thousand banking organizations are likely to disappear under nationwide banking, but that the remaining banks will still number in the thousands, as small community banks that serve their constituents well are likely to remain in business.There appear to be two key challenges to regulators regarding consolidation.  The first is to be sure that there is adequate competition from banks and nonbanks in local banking markets. Research has suggested that high local market concentration leads to prices that are unfavorable to bank customers--low deposit rates for retail depositors and high loan rates for small business loans.  High concentration may also lead to reduced managerial efficiency, as the price cushion provided by market power allows a \"quiet life\" for managers in which relatively little effort is required to be profitable.  Insuring an adequate amount of local-market competition is essential to avoid these potential problems.The second challenge brought on by consolidation is to make sure that mergers and acquisitions do not create excessive risks.  In this regard, it is important that capital be sufficient to cover any problems during the transition period when the banks and systems are learning to work together, on top of the normal risks of ongoing operations.The interaction of bank powers and bank structure The future expansion of banking organization powers also raises some challenges to regulators. Indeed, financial reform will likely be a high priority of the next Congress, perhaps including repeal of Glass-Steagall.  One of the results of financial reform, along the lines of the bill Congressman Leach introduced last session, would be the emergence of financial services holding companies that could include both commercial and investment banks.  There is also a prospect that banks might be able to expand into insurance activities as well.  This would take to a perhaps logical conclusion the recent blurring of the lines between financial services firms.Whether or not the Glass-Steagall Act is repealed, we face the challenges of insuring that the proposed recent expansion of bank powers through section 20 subsidiaries does not inadvertently expand the safety net protection afforded to banks to protect other, previously nonbank, activities. This would give an unfair subsidy to banking organizations.While there is no perfect system for allowing financial intermediaries to gain the most from the synergies of joint production while avoiding expansion of the safety net, there are several steps that seem likely to keep this problem under control.  First, we need to be sure to require plenty of capital in the bank to keep the value of access to the safety net low.  Second, we need to provide reasonable insulation of the bank from the risks of the nonbanking enterprises.  The Board believes that the best way to do this is by placing new activities in holding company subsidiaries, rather than in the bank itself or its subsidiaries.  The further the separation from the bank, the better is the insulation.  A third safeguard to protect the bank and prevent the expansion of the safety net subsidy is the adoption of prudential limitations through firewalls and rules that prohibit or limit certain bank and affiliate transactions.  While firewalls may temporarily bend under stress, they nonetheless serve a useful purpose.  On the other hand, we must strike a balance and not make the firewalls so rigid that they would eliminate the economic synergies between the banks and their affiliates.  In this spirit, the Board last month made an effort to modify firewalls to allow banks to achieve efficiency gains with respect to security underwriting in Section 20 affiliates without creating excessive risks.The issue of what bank structure is appropriate and prudent in light of expanded banking powers is a particularly controversial one.  While the Board’s view that the expanded powers should be carried out only in subsidiaries of the bank holding company was incorporated into the Congressman Leach’s unsuccessful financial modernization bill in the last Congress, this preference is not shared by all parties to this debate.  Some stress the costs associated with the holding company structure and  question its benefits from a safety and soundness perspective and, as a result, favor either allowing the new activities to be carried out in a subsidiary of the bank itself or at least allowing banks an option with respect to structural form.Return to topStaying up-to-date in the supervision of bank risk management as financial products and practices evolve  There will undoubtedly be further developments in the ways that banks perform their core functions of risk measurement, acceptance, and management as markets continue to evolve improved \"best practices\" in dealing with market and credit risks.  This evolution will continue to challenge regulators to keep capital standards and other risk monitoring and control mechanisms from falling too far behind.  One particular challenge is that the continued development of derivative products and other means of managing risks can also allow bank employees to take excessive risks and hide them from supervisors and perhaps from the owners of the bank.  It is difficult for regulators to quantify these risks, and even more difficult to design risk-based deposit insurance and risk-based capital systems that accurately incorporate these risks.In response, regulators will need to stick with capital as the cornerstone of defense against bank risks, both to reduce moral hazard incentives and to provide a buffer stock to absorb losses.  A challenge will be to continue to update the capital standards in line with current or not-too-out-of-date risk measurement techniques.  Expansion of the recently implemented \"internal models\" type of approach may be helpful in this regard, using, as I noted earlier, banks’ own risk measurements to help set their capital requirements.  In addition, many of the techniques used to quantify and control market risks may be transferable for use in quantifying and controlling credit risks in the future.The task of measuring capital and risks can also be made easier if bank portfolios are made somewhat more transparent.  Increased transparency would also facilitate market discipline--a highly desirable goal in our rapidly changing financial environment.  A problem here is that it is not always clear how to best encourage transparency.  For example, partial market value accounting may involve more costs than benefits.  However, it seems clear that this is an issue that will remain on our plates for the foreseeable future.In addition, the capital standards can and should be augmented by bank supervisors in individual cases.  The risk-based capital standards and prompt corrective action rules are, and will remain, only minimum capital guidelines for normal circumstances.  Supervisors need to require additional capital when banks are explicitly taking additional risks that are not captured by the guidelines, or when bank risks are excessively opaque and it is too difficult to determine if excessive risks might be undertaken.  To accomplish this, it is important to continue to examine banks on a regular basis.  There is simply no market substitute for the type of information that can be gathered under the auspices of a bank examination with access to the complete records of a bank.However, as financial transactions become more complex, supervisors cannot be expected to monitor every detail.  Increasingly, supervisors will focus on banks’ risk management procedures. Banks will have to convince supervisors that they have prudent risk management procedures and policies and that the bank follows them.  Increasingly, supervisors will emphasize your process of risk management and control, and proof that you are using those techniques, in order to determine whether your capital is adequate for your risk profile and procedures.Reducing the burden of regulation and increasing the uniformity in regulation across banking agencies While recent banking legislation significantly reduced the regulatory burdens on the banking industry, we all realize that keeping the costs of supervision and regulation low is an important on-going task for all parties.  It is particularly important for the federal banking agencies to continue efforts at improved cooperation with each other, including standardization of certain policies and procedures and data collection.  In short, we must try to reap the potential benefits of multiple regulators in terms of encouraging innovation and providing checks and balances on regulatory excess, without incurring the potential costs of \"competition in laxity\" and excessive overlap and duplication of efforts.  I am optimistic that this can be done, perhaps by augmenting the role of the FFEIC.Return to top1996 Speeches    Home | News and events  Accessibility | Contact Us  To comment on this site, please fill out our feedback form.

      "text/plain": "'Remarks by Governor Edward W. Kelley, Jr. Developments in electronic money and banking At the CyberPayments \\'96 Conference, Dallas, Texas June 18, 1996It is a pleasure to be here this afternoon to provide      the Federal Reserve\\'s perspective on recent developments in the      field of electronic money and banking.  To begin, let me remind      you that progress in the retail electronic banking sector so far      has been slow in the United States.  Twenty years ago, a national      Commission was appointed by the Congress to study many of the      issues surrounding emerging electronic funds transfer systems,      particularly as they were seen to affect consumers and the      general public.  The assumption at that time was that the use of      currency and checks in the United States would rapidly disappear.      Indeed, the creation of the Automated Clearing House system and      NACHA have their roots in this era of our history.  Yet today,      paper currency and checks are still used for the overwhelming      majority of consumer payments, while electronic transfers, such      as those made over the ACH, account for a very small fraction.      In contrast, for the major money and securities markets in this      country, electronic payments are the rule rather than the      exception.  Settlements for these markets generate many of the      electronic funds transfers over the Federal Reserve\\'s Fedwire      system and the New York Clearinghouse CHIPS system, which total      more than $2 trillion per day and represent most of the daily      dollar value of payments in this country.With this background in mind, the Federal Reserve has      adopted a view toward the development of new electronic money and      banking products that emphasizes the need for innovation,      particularly in the retail sector, supported by a realistic      approach to regulation.  It is the private sector that must play      the pivotal role in identifying which services consumers and      businesses want, and are willing to pay for, in areas such as      stored-value -- or \"smart\" -- cards and payments over the      Internet, and in the development of new home-banking products.      If the past is any guide, consumer acceptance and use of new      payment and banking technologies will grow slowly, and we can be      certain that many of the new products will not succeed      commercially.  But those products that do prove to reduce costs      and improve the choices available to consumers and businesses in      conducting their economic activities could gain widespread      acceptance in the longer term.Competition in these efforts is healthy, particularly      in areas where new technologies must be turned into practical      products that, in many cases, will compete with older,      established payment methods and delivery channels.  Although I      would expect that banks will continue to serve as the core of the      payment system, non-banking organizations, which traditionally      have been active in this field, appear to be contributing to the      competitive environment and serving as an impetus to innovation.      Heavy-handed, preemptive attempts at regulating these products      and the competitive process before significant social risks have      been demonstrated would likely handicap innovation for no      compelling reason.  On the other hand, history also suggests      that, if significant problems affecting the economic interests      and well-being of a wide group of our citizens were to arise in      the future, there would be a corresponding legislative and      regulatory response.  While we do not see the need for new      substantive regulations at this time, there is an on-going need      to review existing regulations and supervisory practices in order      to adapt to technological as well as financial innovations, as I      will mention later.Let me now turn to the Federal Reserve\\'s views of the      potential impact of retail electronic banking and payments on the      three primary central banking functions:  monetary policy,      banking supervision, and the payment system.  In these as well as      related areas, such as consumer privacy and industry competition,      the policy issues being raised in the current debate about      electronic payments are the same as those analyzed in the 1970s      by the national EFT Commission.  In fact, in many cases the      striking parallels give the distinct impression that \"we\\'ve been      here before.\"As for the conduct of monetary policy, in hindsight, it      may seem surprising that there were concerns at that time about      the impact of the ACH.  Then as now, the potential impact on      monetary policy of new electronic payment products has been      greatly exaggerated.  As with the use of the ACH, we would not      expect that the expansion of electronic delivery of existing      banking services will have appreciable effects on the money      supply or the money markets.  In contrast, \"electronic cash\" or      other new electronic payment products, if successful, could      gradually lead to shifts among different forms of money held by      consumers and thus potentially affect the behavior of the      monetary aggregates.  Yet concerns about loss of \"control\" of the      money supply are misdirected.  In the last twenty years, major      shifts caused by other financial innovations have led to some      changes over time in the ways in which monetary policy is      formulated, with the monetary aggregates now playing a lesser      role.  Moreover, financial innovation has not seriously      undermined central banks\\' ability to implement policy, although      adaptations have sometimes been called for.Although growth rates of the money supply are no longer      the central focus of monetary policy making, the Federal Reserve      still needs to monitor the monetary aggregates carefully in the      policy process, and it will remain important that the aggregates      accurately measure the various instruments that are being used as      money.  Accordingly, we do expect to include any significant      amounts of new general-purpose payment instruments, such as      balances on stored-value cards, in the monetary aggregates, and      the Federal Reserve has the statutory authority to require any      necessary reports from depository institutions.  If new payment      instruments were issued by nonbanks, we would expect to obtain      voluntary reports from issuers, as we traditionally have done      with travelers checks.Before I move on to the topic of banking supervision,      I would like to touch on the question of \"seigniorage,\" a term      often used for income that governments generate through issuance      of non-interest bearing coin and currency.  First, the amount of      currency displaced by new payment products relative to the amount      outstanding, and the corresponding impact on federal revenues in      the near term, is likely to be very small in percentage terms.      For example, in a scenario in which every resident of the United      States held $150 on a stored-value card or electronic cash      account, which I view as highly optimistic over a near-to-medium-      term horizon, the total value outstanding would amount to less      than $50 billion, or only about 10 percent of the currency stock.      Moreover, estimates are that as much as two-thirds of the value      of U.S. currency circulates abroad, a market where holders may be      even more resistant to giving up Federal Reserve notes for      privately issued electronic products.  Second, even if there is      some erosion of federal revenues due to declining demand for      currency, this should not be a governing factor in public policy      toward innovative payment products.  Indeed, existing products      such as credit and debit cards, along with checking accounts,      have probably reduced the use of currency over time relative to      what it would otherwise have been, which is a natural outcome of      innovation and improvement in banking and payment systems.Second, banking supervision.  While any substantial      implications for monetary and fiscal policy are well into the      future, new electronic banking services could require changes in      the way that banking supervision is conducted in the relatively      near term.  The Federal Reserve is responsible for examining and      assessing the safety and soundness of bank holding companies,      state-chartered Federal Reserve member banks, and U.S. branches      and agencies of foreign banks.  These examinations include a      review of institutions\\' information systems, including security      controls and contingency arrangements.  Internet-based home      banking services, as well as new payment products such as stored-      value cards, have the potential to expose institutions to      significant liability if security measures were breached for      fraudulent or malicious purposes.  Of course, institutions have      strong incentives to protect themselves against these risks, and      early indications are that the more sophisticated are investing      considerable resources in doing so.The Federal Reserve is actively monitoring developments      in this area so as to be in a strong position to address any      supervisory concerns that may arise.  We are reviewing the way      that we examine banks\\' information systems to address      developments in electronic banking, among other things.  However,      banking regulators cannot possibly assess the adequacy of every      Internet firewall or smart card.  Rather, the role of regulators      is to require policies and procedures to be in place within      banking organizations to ensure that risks are identified and      managed.  For example, the Board recently approved the first      application of a bank holding company for a subsidiary to engage      in data processing activities that support the provision of      banking and financial services over the Internet.  In this      approval order, involving the widely publicized Security First      Network Bank, which is offering retail banking services primarily      over the Internet, the Board noted that it expects banking      organizations considering providing such services to analyze      carefully the associated risks and to evaluate whether those      risks are consistent with their policies relating to the security      of customer information and other data.  Of course, banks may      first need to assure themselves that their existing information      security policies and procedures are adequate for an expanding      range of electronic banking activities.  I would hope and expect      such safety evaluations to be demanded by customers, as well as      regulators.The third main area of central bank responsibility is      the payment system.  It may be helpful to begin by considering      the nature of payment systems and how they might be affected by      new electronic payment products.  First, all payment systems      consist of money and the means of transferring money from one      individual or organization to another.  New electronic payment      methods that can be envisioned do not change this fact, although      they may result in different forms of money and new technology      for executing transfers.  Second, the payment system comprises      several main sectors, ranging from large financial institutions      that play a major role both as users and providers of many      different payment services, to consumers and small businesses      that primarily use smaller value payment systems.  Of course, the      Federal Reserve also plays a unifying role in the payment system      as the provider of currency, interbank clearing and settlement      services, and, in some cases, regulator.New electronic payment products, such as stored-value      cards and Internet payment services, are designed primarily to      automate the billions of relatively small-value transactions      involving consumers and non-financial businesses.  The      transactions involved are as diverse as the commercial economy of      the United States, and the future needs for payment systems, both      in traditional face-to-face business and in commerce over open      networks such as the Internet, are evolving daily.While the Federal Reserve\\'s interbank payment services,      such as Fedwire and ACH, have been highly automated for years, we      are examining areas where we can make use of new technology where      appropriate.  For example, we are continuing to keep abreast of      new developments in areas such as encryption, electronic      communications, and data security to ensure that our existing      payment systems take full advantage of any improvements.  As a      side point, I might mention that we are also making use of the      Internet to provide public information services; the Reserve      Banks and the Board of Governors now maintain home pages on the      Internet\\'s World Wide Web, where we provide up-to-date      information that may be useful to the general public, such as      monetary and economic statistics and Federal Reserve      publications.As I have mentioned on previous occasions, however, I      do not anticipate that the Federal Reserve will seek to provide a      new retail electronic payment product in this emerging industry.      In the 1970s, the Federal Reserve took a central role in      developing the ACH system on behalf of the banking industry, and      then explicitly subsidized operation of the ACH for some time.      Now, twenty years later, circumstances are sufficiently different      that we do not believe that a similar approach would be necessary      or desirable to advance the efficiency and effectiveness of the      payment system.  There is no lack of private sector investment in      providing new products and new means of delivering services to      consumers.  Experimentation is needed to determine which products      best fit consumers\\' needs, but history has shown that the private      sector, rather than government, is best able to perform this      role.The Federal Reserve is, however, examining ways in      which we can support industry initiatives where appropriate.  For      example, we are currently reviewing our existing interbank net      settlement services for check clearinghouses and private ACH      operators and considering whether similar services could be      provided for other monetary instruments that the banking industry      may offer to their customers.The Federal Reserve also has specific regulatory      responsibilities as well as a general interest in the continuing      integrity of the payment system.  Some have raised concerns that      new electronic payment products, such as those that could be used      over the Internet or are offered by unregulated entities, could      create new avenues for criminal financial activities or threaten      the integrity of the payment system.  Although the Federal      Reserve, as well as other authorities, will be vigilant in      monitoring developments, we believe that these concerns are      premature.  Until new payment products gain widespread      acceptance, their usefulness in criminal activities will      necessarily be limited.  Moreover, the measures that prudent      institutions will impose to limit the security risks in offering      new products, such as relatively low monetary limits and      transaction record keeping where practical, will also limit their      impact on the payment system more broadly.  Of course, if these      instruments were to spread more quickly than expected and were      provided by organizations that did not have due regard for the      safety of funds entrusted to them, concerns would be greater, as      would the likelihood of regulatory actions.  But we do not see      this prospect on the horizon at this stage.We have focused attention recently on modernizing      existing regulations in the context of our regulatory planning      and review process as well as clarifying how they apply to new      technologies; these efforts should serve to reduce any latent      regulatory barriers or uncertainty that might hinder development      of electronic payment products and services.  For example, the      Board recently adopted changes to Regulation E that would permit      consumers to provide appropriate electronic authorization for      electronic funds transfers, in place of a written signature.  We      have also proposed additional changes to Regulation E under which      required information, such as certain notices and disclosures,      could be transmitted electronically, for example, in home banking      systems.As you probably know, the Federal Reserve Board also      recently issued a request for public comment on the treatment of      stored-value cards under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and      Regulation E.  The proposal would exempt many stored-value cards      from Regulation E provisions, such as liability limits for      unauthorized transfers, error resolution procedures, and printed      receipts and account statements.  Cards with maximum balances of      less than $100 would be wholly exempt, while issuers of most      larger-value cards would need to disclose the terms and      conditions of the cards to customers, a practice that would be      prudent for any new product.  I hope industry participants as      well as potential users will provide comments to help us refine      the proposal over the coming months and ensure that it provides      the appropriate level of consumer protection without unnecessary      and costly regulatory burdens or undesirable incentives.History has shown that technological innovations can      provide widespread benefits across society.  The Federal Reserve      welcomes private-sector investment and innovation to improve      efficiency and effectiveness in all areas of banking and payments      activities, while at the same time preserving the safety and      soundness of the financial system.  We are always open to      discussions and suggestions from the industry in this respect and      on any other issues involving emerging money and banking      products.  This is the strategy I expect we will pursue as      experience with new electronic money and banking products unfolds      over the next few years.Return to top1996 Speeches     Home | News and events  Accessibility | Contact Us  Last update: July 23, 1996 12:00 PM   (function(){var js = \"window[\\'__CF$cv$params\\']={r:\\'7648c52feb497136\\',m:\\'D06JJUGqatsQa11vNVHUkYzwIwmZiZct94KJC7lx9FQ-1667516889-0-AUDs4iiodUtGF05lcguwzoKCKSM2ydcflx+rU09wUDL2ebl3FICsgx/4fzkSOnm4fgInzbKEMyktFvU2Q0mOH4XKGkHHLUqgUH29SHkO7f0bdnNcfUJZdHDr91iQ/5gEZ4plUhWTwh3Z/E9Drwmj3NjmIZQIdfwxlHolnZp96CQR\\',s:[0x4fad077ef0,0x46d058c706],u:\\'/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/h/g\\'};var now=Date.now()/1000,offset=14400,ts=\\'\\'+(Math.floor(now)-Math.floor(now%offset)),_cpo=document.createElement(\\'script\\');_cpo.nonce=\\'\\',_cpo.src=\\'/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/h/g/scripts/alpha/invisible.js?ts=\\'+ts,document.getElementsByTagName(\\'head\\')[0].appendChild(_cpo);\";var _0xh = document.createElement(\\'iframe\\');_0xh.height = 1;_0xh.width = 1;_0xh.style.position = \\'absolute\\';_0xh.style.top = 0;_0xh.style.left = 0;_0xh.style.border = \\'none\\';_0xh.style.visibility = \\'hidden\\';document.body.appendChild(_0xh);function handler() {var _0xi = _0xh.contentDocument || _0xh.contentWindow.document;if (_0xi) {var _0xj = _0xi.createElement(\\'script\\');_0xj.nonce = \\'\\';_0xj.innerHTML = js;_0xi.getElementsByTagName(\\'head\\')[0].appendChild(_0xj);}}if (document.readyState !== \\'loading\\') {handler();} else if (window.addEventListener) {document.addEventListener(\\'DOMContentLoaded\\', handler);} else {var prev = document.onreadystatechange || function () {};document.onreadystatechange = function (e) {prev(e);if (document.readyState !== \\'loading\\') {document.onreadystatechange = prev;handler();}};}})();'"

      "text/plain": "'Remarks by Governor Edward W. Kelley, Jr. Developments in electronic money and banking At the CyberPayments \\'96 Conference, Dallas, Texas June 18, 1996It is a pleasure to be here this afternoon to provide      the Federal Reserve\\'s perspective on recent developments in the      field of electronic money and banking.  To begin, let me remind      you that progress in the retail electronic banking sector so far      has been slow in the United States.  Twenty years ago, a national      Commission was appointed by the Congress to study many of the      issues surrounding emerging electronic funds transfer systems,      particularly as they were seen to affect consumers and the      general public.  The assumption at that time was that the use of      currency and checks in the United States would rapidly disappear.      Indeed, the creation of the Automated Clearing House system and      NACHA have their roots in this era of our history.  Yet today,      paper currency and checks are still used for the overwhelming      majority of consumer payments, while electronic transfers, such      as those made over the ACH, account for a very small fraction.      In contrast, for the major money and securities markets in this      country, electronic payments are the rule rather than the      exception.  Settlements for these markets generate many of the      electronic funds transfers over the Federal Reserve\\'s Fedwire      system and the New York Clearinghouse CHIPS system, which total      more than $2 trillion per day and represent most of the daily      dollar value of payments in this country.With this background in mind, the Federal Reserve has      adopted a view toward the development of new electronic money and      banking products that emphasizes the need for innovation,      particularly in the retail sector, supported by a realistic      approach to regulation.  It is the private sector that must play      the pivotal role in identifying which services consumers and      businesses want, and are willing to pay for, in areas such as      stored-value -- or \"smart\" -- cards and payments over the      Internet, and in the development of new home-banking products.      If the past is any guide, consumer acceptance and use of new      payment and banking technologies will grow slowly, and we can be      certain that many of the new products will not succeed      commercially.  But those products that do prove to reduce costs      and improve the choices available to consumers and businesses in      conducting their economic activities could gain widespread      acceptance in the longer term.Competition in these efforts is healthy, particularly      in areas where new technologies must be turned into practical      products that, in many cases, will compete with older,      established payment methods and delivery channels.  Although I      would expect that banks will continue to serve as the core of the      payment system, non-banking organizations, which traditionally      have been active in this field, appear to be contributing to the      competitive environment and serving as an impetus to innovation.      Heavy-handed, preemptive attempts at regulating these products      and the competitive process before significant social risks have      been demonstrated would likely handicap innovation for no      compelling reason.  On the other hand, history also suggests      that, if significant problems affecting the economic interests      and well-being of a wide group of our citizens were to arise in      the future, there would be a corresponding legislative and      regulatory response.  While we do not see the need for new      substantive regulations at this time, there is an on-going need      to review existing regulations and supervisory practices in order      to adapt to technological as well as financial innovations, as I      will mention later.Let me now turn to the Federal Reserve\\'s views of the      potential impact of retail electronic banking and payments on the      three primary central banking functions:  monetary policy,      banking supervision, and the payment system.  In these as well as      related areas, such as consumer privacy and industry competition,      the policy issues being raised in the current debate about      electronic payments are the same as those analyzed in the 1970s      by the national EFT Commission.  In fact, in many cases the      striking parallels give the distinct impression that \"we\\'ve been      here before.\"As for the conduct of monetary policy, in hindsight, it      may seem surprising that there were concerns at that time about      the impact of the ACH.  Then as now, the potential impact on      monetary policy of new electronic payment products has been      greatly exaggerated.  As with the use of the ACH, we would not      expect that the expansion of electronic delivery of existing      banking services will have appreciable effects on the money      supply or the money markets.  In contrast, \"electronic cash\" or      other new electronic payment products, if successful, could      gradually lead to shifts among different forms of money held by      consumers and thus potentially affect the behavior of the      monetary aggregates.  Yet concerns about loss of \"control\" of the      money supply are misdirected.  In the last twenty years, major      shifts caused by other financial innovations have led to some      changes over time in the ways in which monetary policy is      formulated, with the monetary aggregates now playing a lesser      role.  Moreover, financial innovation has not seriously      undermined central banks\\' ability to implement policy, although      adaptations have sometimes been called for.Although growth rates of the money supply are no longer      the central focus of monetary policy making, the Federal Reserve      still needs to monitor the monetary aggregates carefully in the      policy process, and it will remain important that the aggregates      accurately measure the various instruments that are being used as      money.  Accordingly, we do expect to include any significant      amounts of new general-purpose payment instruments, such as      balances on stored-value cards, in the monetary aggregates, and      the Federal Reserve has the statutory authority to require any      necessary reports from depository institutions.  If new payment      instruments were issued by nonbanks, we would expect to obtain      voluntary reports from issuers, as we traditionally have done      with travelers checks.Before I move on to the topic of banking supervision,      I would like to touch on the question of \"seigniorage,\" a term      often used for income that governments generate through issuance      of non-interest bearing coin and currency.  First, the amount of      currency displaced by new payment products relative to the amount      outstanding, and the corresponding impact on federal revenues in      the near term, is likely to be very small in percentage terms.      For example, in a scenario in which every resident of the United      States held $150 on a stored-value card or electronic cash      account, which I view as highly optimistic over a near-to-medium-      term horizon, the total value outstanding would amount to less      than $50 billion, or only about 10 percent of the currency stock.      Moreover, estimates are that as much as two-thirds of the value      of U.S. currency circulates abroad, a market where holders may be      even more resistant to giving up Federal Reserve notes for      privately issued electronic products.  Second, even if there is      some erosion of federal revenues due to declining demand for      currency, this should not be a governing factor in public policy      toward innovative payment products.  Indeed, existing products      such as credit and debit cards, along with checking accounts,      have probably reduced the use of currency over time relative to      what it would otherwise have been, which is a natural outcome of      innovation and improvement in banking and payment systems.Second, banking supervision.  While any substantial      implications for monetary and fiscal policy are well into the      future, new electronic banking services could require changes in      the way that banking supervision is conducted in the relatively      near term.  The Federal Reserve is responsible for examining and      assessing the safety and soundness of bank holding companies,      state-chartered Federal Reserve member banks, and U.S. branches      and agencies of foreign banks.  These examinations include a      review of institutions\\' information systems, including security      controls and contingency arrangements.  Internet-based home      banking services, as well as new payment products such as stored-      value cards, have the potential to expose institutions to      significant liability if security measures were breached for      fraudulent or malicious purposes.  Of course, institutions have      strong incentives to protect themselves against these risks, and      early indications are that the more sophisticated are investing      considerable resources in doing so.The Federal Reserve is actively monitoring developments      in this area so as to be in a strong position to address any      supervisory concerns that may arise.  We are reviewing the way      that we examine banks\\' information systems to address      developments in electronic banking, among other things.  However,      banking regulators cannot possibly assess the adequacy of every      Internet firewall or smart card.  Rather, the role of regulators      is to require policies and procedures to be in place within      banking organizations to ensure that risks are identified and      managed.  For example, the Board recently approved the first      application of a bank holding company for a subsidiary to engage      in data processing activities that support the provision of      banking and financial services over the Internet.  In this      approval order, involving the widely publicized Security First      Network Bank, which is offering retail banking services primarily      over the Internet, the Board noted that it expects banking      organizations considering providing such services to analyze      carefully the associated risks and to evaluate whether those      risks are consistent with their policies relating to the security      of customer information and other data.  Of course, banks may      first need to assure themselves that their existing information      security policies and procedures are adequate for an expanding      range of electronic banking activities.  I would hope and expect      such safety evaluations to be demanded by customers, as well as      regulators.The third main area of central bank responsibility is      the payment system.  It may be helpful to begin by considering      the nature of payment systems and how they might be affected by      new electronic payment products.  First, all payment systems      consist of money and the means of transferring money from one      individual or organization to another.  New electronic payment      methods that can be envisioned do not change this fact, although      they may result in different forms of money and new technology      for executing transfers.  Second, the payment system comprises      several main sectors, ranging from large financial institutions      that play a major role both as users and providers of many      different payment services, to consumers and small businesses      that primarily use smaller value payment systems.  Of course, the      Federal Reserve also plays a unifying role in the payment system      as the provider of currency, interbank clearing and settlement      services, and, in some cases, regulator.New electronic payment products, such as stored-value      cards and Internet payment services, are designed primarily to      automate the billions of relatively small-value transactions      involving consumers and non-financial businesses.

We are always open to      discussions and suggestions from the industry in this respect and      on any other issues involving emerging money and banking      products.

      "text/plain": "'Monetary Policy Objectives and StrategyI want to share with you this evening my perspective on the challenges facing monetary policy in the current economic environment.  But I also want to emphasize the importance of setting monetary policy as part of a longer-run strategy that provides guidance of how to juggle multiple targets in the short run while maintaining a focus on achieving price stability in the long run.I will begin with a brief discussion of the objectives of monetary policy, then turn to the outlook issues that are, in my judgment, central to near-term policy decisions, and end with a few comments on one aspect of longer-run strategic considerations.Identifying the Objectives I am used to delivering my intermediate macro lectures this time of year.  I always start out identifying the norms of good macroeconomic performance which, in turn, become the objectives for macroeconomic policy.  This is a good place to start. I include full employment, growth (meaning the growth in productive capacity), and price stability. This is familiar ground and I don\\'t expect I need to defend this list to this group.From my new perspective, it is important to appreciate that economic theory suggests some specialization among the objectives between monetary and fiscal policies. Understanding this specialization will prevent us from expecting more from monetary policy than it can promise to deliver and help us better appreciate the singular nature of the long-run objective for monetary policy.Economic theory, in the form of the long-run neutrality of money, tells us that monetary policy cannot affect the level or growth rate of output in the long run.  So don\\'t saddle monetary policy with responsibilities for stimulating the growth of productive capacity.  If it were easy to produce more long-run growth simply by printing money we would have monetized our way to dramatically higher living standards a long time ago. What monetary policy does do, according to economic theory, is set the rate of inflation in the long run.  As I said in my opening statement in my confirmation hearings, when it comes to assigning responsibility for inflation, the buck literally stops at the Federal Reserve. Price stability is therefore the singular and unique long-run objective for monetary policy.  Fiscal policy, on the other hand, can be an instrument of growth policy, through its effect on national saving via the structural budget deficit, through incentive effects on work, saving and investment via tax rates and tax structure, and through public investment in human capital and physical infrastructure.  While we should not overstate what fiscal policy can deliver on this score, we should remember where the levers for growth policy are located.There is less agreement about what economic theory and empirical macroeconomics tell us about the potential for stabilization policy. My reading is that both monetary and fiscal policies, via their influence on aggregate demand, affect output and employment in the short run.  While we should not forget the lecture on inside and outside lags, parameter uncertainty, and other cautionary tales that preclude fine tuning, neither should we dismiss the stabilization role that can be played by some combination of the two policies.  In practice, recently and for the indefinite future, fiscal policy is dominated with the task of reducing the deficit, leaving the stabilization objective almost exclusively in the hands of the Federal Reserve.Outlook Issues Challenging Monetary Policy Today There are two questions related to the current economic outlook that, in my view, challenge monetary policy in the near term.  I expect you will focus on these issues in your outlook session tomorrow.  First, in the absence of policy adjustment, is the economy slowing or likely to slow to trend quickly enough to stabilize the unemployment rate at its current level?  Second, is the current unemployment already so low that remaining at this level would trigger a steady increase in the rate of inflation?I note that most of the private sector forecasts I follow, along with the Blue Chip Consensus, all provide an affirmative answer to the first question.  All have growth near 2% in the second half of 1996 and through 1997.  I presume the NABE survey that you will present tomorrow is also consistent with this story.  Of course, one has to be careful interpreting these forecasts, because some of the private sector forecasts that have growth slowing to trend do so in the context of an assumed modest tightening of monetary policy, but many suggest a slowing to trend without such an adjustment.  But you appreciate the issue here.  Any answer, of course, is provisional, subject to adjustment to incoming data and therefore to be reviewed as appropriate over time.I should note that growth itself does not cause inflation.  However,  above-trend growth, without an accompanying increase in participation rates, implies further decline in the unemployment rate which may already be at or even below its full employment level.  A further decline in the unemployment rate, from its current level, would, in turn, increase the risk of an acceleration of inflation.That brings me to the second question. Are we already below NAIRU?  In that case, a slowdown to trend would not be sufficient to prevent an acceleration in inflation. The answer is, unfortunately, not that easy.  On the one hand, estimates of NAIRU from a data sample that covers the last 20 to 30 years suggest a value close to 6%.  This indicates we are below NAIRU and should expect a steady rise in the inflation rate going forward. The problem with this conclusion is that we would have expected, in this case, some upward pressure on prices over the past two years.  I do not want to ignore the possibility that transitory favorable supply shocks can, for a while, offset the effect of a below-NAIRU unemployment rate on inflation.  But I do not believe that special factors alone can explain away the tension between an unemployment rate persistently below traditional estimates of NAIRU and the stable to declining inflation over the past two years.Indeed, I expect many don\\'t appreciate how well behaved inflation has been over this period.  Over the year ended in the second quarter, most broad measures of inflation, both product and expenditure-side measures, have been near 2% and when measured net of food and energy, below 2%.  A couple of examples: For the chain-type GDP deflator, the inflation rate over this period was 2.2% and the last available reading, for the second quarter, was 2.2%.  For the Gross Domestic Purchases chain-type price index, the inflation rate over the last year was 2.0% and the rate in the second quarter was 2.1%.  In both of these cases, inflation was also lower in the year ended in the second quarter of 1996 than over the preceding year.  So inflation is quite modest, it has not evidenced any increase over the last year, and, in fact, has shown signs of further decline.  It might add that, net of food and energy, broad expenditure measures show inflation below 2% over the past year.The CPI, the inflation measure which receives the most attention, is, admittedly, a bit of an outlier.  Its inflation rate is closer to 3% than to 2%, resulting in an unusually wide gap between the inflation rates for the CPI and other broad price indices.  Still, even in the case of the CPI, inflation is lower over the year ended in the second quarter than over the preceding year for both overall and core measures.As a result of the recent inflation experience, estimation techniques which weight the current data more heavily (so-called time varying parameter estimation) suggest that NAIRU has declined recently and may be as low as 5 1 /2%.So one of the challenges to monetary policy is how to operate when there is a higher degree of uncertainty about where NAIRU is.  I feel this tension more than most. I have emphasized throughout my career the importance of the expectations-augmented Phillips Curve in my view of the inflation process and its value as a forecasting tool.  The Phillips Curve played an important supporting role in the forecasting awards Joel, Chris and I won over the years.  But the tension is there and we have to weigh the risk of higher inflation if the longer-run estimate of NAIRU proves correct against the potential that the recent stability in inflation reflects a change in structure that will persist.Tempering some of the optimism about NAIRU and recent inflation is evidence of at least a modest acceleration in wages and compensation.  This trend is of concern, although there are questions about whether or not it signals an upturn in price inflation.  Is the higher pace of wage change, for example, in part a passing through to workers of the slower rate of increase in benefit costs incurred over the last few years by firms? Labor costs, of course, are based on total compensation not wages, so we might want, especially given the slowdown in benefit cost inflation, to keep our focus on the broader compensation measure rather than on wage change alone.  The rate of increase in compensation, itself, is edging higher--2.9% over the year ended in the second quarter for the ECI, compared to 2.6% over the previous year.  The question here is whether the current rate of increase in compensation remains consistent with stable price inflation, either because it is being accompanied, at least for a while, by a compression in profit margins or because it still remains low relative to trend productivity. But we also have to be careful about making too many excuses.  At any rate, the developments related to wages, compensation and productivity deserve particular scrutiny.Last week\\'s labor market report underscores once again the considerable momentum of the economic expansion and highlights the issues I\\'ve been discussing.  The economy continued to generate jobs at an impressive clip last month--indeed, at a pace faster than the trend growth of the labor force.  The unemployment rate dropped noticeably below the range over the past two years, to 5.1 %.  Moreover, average wage rates increased substantially, presumable reflecting the pressures that employers face in attempting to attract and retain workers in a relatively tight labor market.We of course all welcome an improvement in earnings.  For some time now, many American workers have not fully shared in the fruits of our economic growth. But the question is whether the recent wage gains will be real in terms of greater effective purchasing power, or whether the associated increases in costs of production will only be mirrored in an offsetting acceleration of prices.  To date, firms have found ways to offset those costs--or, in some cases, have been forced by competitive conditions to absorb some of them in their profit margins.  The question is whether this process will continue in the months ahead, holding inflation in check.  Certainly, there is still a widespread view that firms do not have so-called pricing leverage.  But, there is no question that the latest data reinforce the sense that Chairman Greenspan expressed a couple of months ago that we are in a circumstance in which a prudent central bank must exercise heightened surveillance of the inflationary risks and stand ready to respond if necessary.Juggling Multiple Targets in the Short Run But this is just a single episode for monetary policy.  Decisions made in this episode should be part of a longer-run strategy and should be understood in that broader context.  I want to turn my attention now to one aspect of a longer-term strategy that might help the Federal Reserve juggle multiple targets in a disciplined fashion and bridge from short-run policy to long-term objectives.Let\\'s assume, for the sake of the rest of my remarks, that growth slows to trend, the unemployment rate stabilizes at its current level, and inflation remains stable.  Humor me.  What then for monetary policy?At this point we confront the dreaded trade-off.  There is, to be sure, no trade-off and hence no inconsistency between full employment and price stability in the long run. Therefore, maximum employment (at least if interpreted as full employment or being at NAIRU) and price stability, the statutory mandate of the Federal Reserve, are compatible  in the long run.  Full employment can be achieved either with price stability or with positive stable inflation.  So the mandate, in my interpretation, does dictate that we move to price stability, because this is only there that we can achieve both objectives simultaneously.  That still leaves us the strategic question of how to juggle the goals of full employment and price stability in the short run when the initial conditions do involve a conflict among the ultimate objectives--for example, the current combination of modest, stable inflation and full employment.  Reasonable people can and do disagree about what to do in this case.  It is desirable that monetary policy respond to this challenge in a systematic way.  This would allow the private sector to both anticipate where monetary policy is headed and retain confidence that the Federal Reserve remains focused on its long-run objective as it carries out its meeting-to-meeting policies.The Taylor Rule is a simple example of a strategy that juggles the two objectives in a disciplined manner without losing sight of the long-run price stability objective.  The Taylor Rule varies the real federal funds rate relative to some equilibrium level in response to both the deviation of output from its full employment level and of inflation from its long-run target.  This rule, in effect, worries continuously about both output relative to potential and inflation relative to price stability.  The Taylor Rule has stabilizing properties across a range of models, describes to a reasonable approximation recent Federal Reserve policy, and similar specifications describe the behavior of many other central banks in industrialized counties.  I do not want to mislead you about the degree to which I believe we can rely on any single rule in general or my commitment to the Taylor Rule in particular.  But the Taylor Rule helps illustrate some important aspects of monetary policy strategy.The Taylor Rule would resolve the near-term conflict between objectives in the current economic environment by encouraging some slack in the economy and thereby ensuring downward pressure on inflation over time, as long as inflation were above the long-run inflation target, while still balancing along the way both the inflation and employment objectives.Opportunistic Disinflation A couple of years ago, I gave the name \"opportunistic disinflation\" to an alternative strategy for bridging between short-run policy and long-run goals, a strategy that I observed the Federal Reserve to be following at the time. I will use this strategy this evening to describe my own position.  But I want to make clear that I am not speaking for others on the FOMC or describing official policy.  Under this strategy, once inflation becomes modest, as today, Federal Reserve policy in the near term focuses on sustaining trend growth at full employment at the prevailing inflation rate.  At this point the short-run priorities are twofold: sustaining the expansion and preventing an acceleration of inflation.  This is, nevertheless, a strategy for disinflation because it takes advantage of the opportunity of inevitable recessions and potential positive supply shocks to ratchet down inflation over time.  Proponents of this strategy sometimes describe this approach as reducing inflation cycle-to-cycle or describe the economy as being one recession from price stability. Under this strategy, if growth were to slow to trend, the unemployment rate were to remain where it is, and inflation were to remain stable, monetary policy would remain on hold, ready to respond aggressively to any acceleration of inflation, but otherwise prepared to be patient and accept the lower inflation that will accompany the next recession or favorable supply shock.This is just another rule, though a more complicated one than the simple Taylor Rule.  It also links short-run policy actions to long-run objectives, juggles multiple targets in a disciplined way, and would be successful in achieving the long-run objective over time.So let me sum up how I look at the challenges facing monetary policy in the current economic environment and in light of the longer run strategic issues I have set out this evening.  In the near term, I believe we should be vigilant to insure that the progress made to lower inflation to the current level is sustained.  I am, as a result, focused on forecasts of near-term growth relative to trend as a forward-looking indicator of changes in utilization rates, on utilization rates themselves as forward-looking indicators of inflation pressures, on labor costs as a key factor in the transmission of demand pressure to price inflation, and, given the uncertainty about NAIRU, on readings of the current inflation rate.  I think I have covered all the bases!  While I am focused on holding the line on inflation in the short run, I am also mindful of the importance of continuing progress toward price stability over the longer run and of the importance that current decisions be part of a longer strategic plan.  Nevertheless, you will not hear me complain or apologize if, over the next year, the chain GDP deflator remains near 2%, the unemployment rate remains near 5 1/2%, and the economy grows near trend.Return to top1996 Speeches'"

      "text/plain": "'the Transformation of the U.S. Banking Industry and Resulting Challenges to RegulatorsGood morning .   it be a pleasure to be here on Ohio Bankers Day . the over - ride theme of my remark be the profound transformation the banking industry have undergo over the last 15 year or so and the challenge that these change pose to bank regulator .   at the end , I hope to have time to take some question and learn where you think the banking industry be go , and how -- consistent with our responsibility -- regulator can promote a more efficient , resilient , and profitable financial service industry .   I plan to learn as much or more from you as you learn from I . the Role of Banks let I begin with a few observation about the importance of the banking industry in the economy and why banking receive such special attention in term of regulation . bank , like other financial intermediary , pool and absorb risk for depositor and provide stable source of investment and work capital fund for nonfinancial industry . bank also provide a unique mix of service among all financial intermediary , include a \" safe haven \" for small , unsophisticated investor through insured deposit , an important source of fund for small borrower who often have limit access to other source of external finance , a smoothly function payment system that allow financial and real resource to flow relatively freely to their high - return use , a conduit for monetary policy , and a backup source of liquidity for any sector in temporary difficulty through its access to the discount window . throughout all the change of the past , and through all the change to the banking industry in the foreseeable future , bank will continue to perform these important function , and a goal of bank regulator be to make sure that there be a healthy banking industry to do so . return to topThe Rationale for Bank Regulation but there be two particularly important characteristic of the banking system that demand our attention as regulator -- indeed , be critical to understand why there be bank regulator .   first , bank have access to a government safety net through deposit insurance , the discount window , and payment system guarantee .   this give the government a direct stake in keep bank risk under control , just like a private insurance company have a stake in control the risk of policyholder .   because deposit insurance can never be fully and accurately price , it be necessary for we to monitor and sometimes to act to control bank risk in order to protect the potential call on taxpayer .   it be also important to understand that an unintended consequence of the safety net be that it create or augment incentive for some bank to take additional risk .   that be , the safety net create moral hazard incentive to gamble because the safety net -- and potentially taxpayer -- may absorb most of the loss if the gamble fail .   deposit insurance get in the way of the depositor signal a bank when it take excessive risk . the second characteristic of bank that require the special attention of regulator be that bank be capable of be the conduit of systemic risk and crisis in financial market .   a breakdown of the payment system or other contagion effect that hamper the ability of bank to intermediate credit flow could have serious adverse consequence for the economy , again require the special attention of regulator to bank risk . the challenge be to strike a balance in regulation so that , on the one hand , taxpayer be protect , extension of the safety net be avoid , and moral hazard incentive be mitigate without , on the other hand , undermine the competitiveness of the banking industry and its ability to take risk , and therefore damage the entity the regulator be try to protect . return to topThe Evolution of Bank Regulation although this rationale for bank regulation have not change , in the last decade and a half there have be a significant evolution in approach of regulator toward maintain the safety and soundness of the banking industry .   from the 1930 through most of the 1970 , regulator focus on keep the banking industry safe and sound by protect bank from competition and by limit the activity in which they could participate .   this mean , for example , prohibit interstate banking , restrict the rate that bank could pay on deposit , and prevent commercial bank from compete in other product market , such as investment banking .   during this period , the financial service industry be segment into separate entity provide commercial banking , investment banking , insurance service , etc .   this separation be largely due to legislative and regulatory decision .   a consequence of the separation be that firm in each segment of the financial service industry be protect from competition from firm provide the other service . start in the late 1970 , the change economic environment along with advance in technology , financial innovation , and globalization result in increase competition to U.S. bank by thrift , nondepository financial institution , foreign bank , and the capital market .   higher and more variable interest rate , and the accompany increase yield sensitivity of depositor and borrower , contribute to the development of money market mutual fund as alternative to bank deposit and the growth of finance company and commercial paper as substitute for bank loan . the increase in external competition bring a swift response from both bank and their regulator . bank respond to the challenge by expand in way that they could , also take advantage of improvement in technology and apply finance .   they expand their role as intermediary through off - balance - sheet activity such as securitization , back - up line of credit and derivative , and , in the process , substitute fee income for some of the interest income lose through competition with other financial intermediary . in addition , bank seek expand power to help they compete , include be able to cross state border , set their own deposit rate and account type , and -- by the late-1980 -- expand into security underwriting activity . regulator respond to the new environment by reduce the regulatory burden on bank and allow they to compete on a more level playing field with nonbanke firm .   that be , the new market reality require a reorientation in emphasis from protect bank from competition to give bank the opportunity to compete not only with other bank but with nonbank competitor as well .   by allow bank to enter other state , set their own price , and engage in other than traditional banking activity , the orientation of regulator evolve toward protect the safety net while allow bank to deliver financial service to the public efficiently , profitably , and with sufficient capital to be protect against unforeseen event . return to topStructural Change in the Banking Industry as a result of this process of structural change , the banking industry of the mid-1990 in many way hardly resemble that of the late 1970 and early 1980s .   some of the major change that I want to focus on be the increase consolidation of the industry , the decline in traditional banking service as a result of increase outside competition , the expansion in bank power , include the move into nontraditional activity to offset the competition for their traditional product , the increase emphasis on risk management in response to the increase complexity of financial instrument and practice , and the evolution of capital standard and capital position to keep abreast of the change risk profile of banking organization . consolidation in the banking industry one of the most obvious and dramatic change be the consolidation of the banking industry . the number of independent banking organization -- by which I mean top - tier hold company plus unaffiliated bank -- have shrink by more than one - third since the late 1970 , from more than 12,000 to few than 8,000 .   the percentage of banking asset control by organization with more than $ 100 billion have about double , and be now close to a fifth of all U.S. banking asset , while the percentage of banking asset in banking organization with less than $ 100 million in asset have drop by half , from about 14 percent to 7 percent of industry asset . much of the consolidation be a direct outgrowth of the removal of geographic restriction on bank branching and hold company acquisition by the individual state , a process that be now be extend by the Reagle - Neal Interstate Banking and Branch Efficiency Act of 1994 .   this deregulation encourage the banking industry to become more efficient at serve the public ’s need by allow the efficient competitor to succeed and manage more of the industry ’s resource .   the banking industry have also become strong through the geographic diversification of risk make possible by interstate banking . importantly , the interstate expansion of large bank do not mean the end of small bank .   past experience have consistently show that when large banking organization enter a new local market by acquisition , the exist small bank that be efficient can compete successfully and maintain their market share and profitability .   we fully expect thousand of small bank to remain in business even after nationwide branching be fully implement . the emergence of , and response to , increase outside competition : a decline in traditional banking and the growth of nontraditional activity over the last 15 year , there have also be a substantial increase in competition to the U.S. banking industry from capital market , less - regulate domestic financial institution , and foreign institution .   as a result , U.S. bank have lose substantial market share of many of the asset and liability category that be the mainstay of traditional banking .   however , these decline in market share for bank in traditional product line do not suggest that the banking industry itself be in decline .   after factor into the analysis the rapid expansion of nontraditional off - balance - sheet activity , research suggest that the banking industry continue to grow , although not as fast as financial market as a whole .   the banking industry , for example , have grow at about the same rate as GDP and the new product of the banking industry -- such as derivative contract and other off - balance - sheet activity -- have skyrocket . the most important indicator of whether the banking industry be in decline -- measure of financial performance -- be even more positive .   the banking industry be profitable , able to raise capital in financial market , and have a relatively high market - to - book ratio .   these performance indicator also suggest that resource will continue to flow into the industry , rather than out of the industry .   the evidence take as a whole suggest that the banking industry be weather the increase in outside competition and be compete well against it . return to topthe expansion of bank power the power of banking organization also grow dramatically over this time period in two different way .   first , in the early 1980s , the Monetary Control Act give bank the right to set their own deposit interest rate and offer new type of account , such as household transaction account that pay market - base interest rate . another major way in which banking organization power expand over this period be the increase in the number of banking activity permit to nonbank affiliate of bank hold company .   regulator allow bank hold company to enter more and more product market over this time period .   bank hold company can now have separately capitalize subsidiary that offer investment advice , provide discount brokerage service , and underwrite both debt and equity security , albeit under restricted circumstance .   the market also play a large part in blur the old distinction between bank and nonbank , as other financial service company begin to offer more product with characteristic close to those of bank deposit and loan . again , the regulatory shift in orientation be in large part a reaction to the market -- bank be give more power to compete with nonbank in part because nonbank be figure out well way to compete against bank . it be also notable that over time bank have take much great advantage of the power they already have .   as I mention early , bank greatly increase their use of off - balance - sheet guarantee to follow some of their loan customer who choose to borrow their fund elsewhere , and bank be also active player in the new derivative product of the 1980 and 1990s . increase emphasis on risk management and the grow importance of market risk despite these many change , the core business of banking have remain the measurement , acceptance , and management of risk , although a number of important development over the last 15 to 20 year have improve the ability of bank to perform these function .   the most notable development be in the area of market risk .   derivative contract such as future and swap be essentially new line of business for bank in the last decade and a half , which allow bank to measure , accept , and manage market risk to a much great extent than in the past . in the 1970 , bank primarily measure , accept , and manage the credit risk of illiquid loan and deal little with market risk other than minimal asset - liability duration matching .   the rapid development in market risk tool have facilitate an expansion of the core business of banking to put an increase emphasis on market risk , but bank be nonetheless still primarily in the same core business of measure , accept , and manage risk . however , it be important to recognize that have access to improve risk management technology do not necessarily make bank safe .   despite the improvement in the ability of bank to understand and control risk , the risk of the institution themselves ultimately also depend importantly on the incentive of bank manager and owner to control risk , and on the economic environment in which they operate .   there be little benefit , and perhaps net cost , in have a bank manager know how to measure , accept , and manage risk accurately if this ability be use to take excessive risk that be largely bear by the federal safety net and potentially by taxpayer .   similarly , when the economic environment turn against bank investment , many bank will become risky and some will fail , even if they have manage their risk fairly well . return to top     the source of the large number of bank failure in the 1980 and the dramatic improvement in the health of the banking system in the 1990 these caveat be well illustrate by compare the circumstance of U.S. bank in the 1980 versus the 1990s .   during the 1980s , bank failure be increase , and by the end of the decade bank be fail at the rate of about 200 per year .   even great problem be experience by the saving and loan industry .   these problem have be largely attribute to two factor . first , when bank or saving and loan get into very low or negative capital position , the moral hazard problem I discuss early may become more severe .   there be a possibility of purposely take on additional risk to gamble their way out of trouble .   when there be little capital at risk , the owner get much of the benefit if the gamble pay off , and the safety net and taxpayer bear most of the loss if the gamble fail . second , the 1980s see a number of turbulent economic change .   these include fluctuation in interest rate and inflation rate , swing in the price of commercial real estate and junk bond that could not be easily forecast , and regional recession that cause significant number of problem loan .   these change cause damage at many financial institution , particularly those in geographically undiversified position without sufficient capital to protect themselves . give the poor condition of many bank as late as 1991 , it be amazing how healthy the banking industry be now , having write off most of its bad asset , raise large amount of capital , and return to profitability , likely have its fifth straight year of record profit in 1996 .   bank failure have now retreat to at or near single digit per year .   clearly , this turnaround be too rapid to be completely account for by technical and financial innovation in the measurement , acceptance , and management of risk , or by improvement in the diversification and capitalization of bank .   change in attitude toward risk taking bring about by the high capital standard and other factor , and change in the economic environment have also play important role in the improved health and wealth of the banking industry . the evolution of capital standard and capital position the final development I will discuss be the evolution of the financial capital position of U.S. bank , since capital be the cornerstone of defense against bank risk .   Capital serve two function in this regard .   first , it help improve the incentive of bank to keep their own risk under control , reduce moral hazard incentive to take those risk that be largely impose on other . second , capital be a buffer stock available to absorb risk and economic shock without create bankruptcy cost and systemic problem associate with the failure of financial institution . a goal of capital requirement -- along with bank supervision and quality risk management by the bank themselves -- be to make the safety net a moot issue for most bank .   that be , by have enough capital available to absorb potential loss and have both the bank and supervisor carefully monitoring and act to control portfolio risk , the moral hazard incentive of the safety net and the vulnerability of the deposit insurance fund can be keep to a minimum .   it be similarly true that the more we can do to keep risk to the safety net under control use capital and other tool , the more power we can safely grant to bank without place undue stress on the safety net or meaningfully expand safety net protection to other activity . at the end of the 1970 , capital regulation be relatively ad hoc and depend largely on the judgment and discretion of the individual bank ’s supervisor .   start in 1981 , regulation require bank to hold capital equal to a flat percentage of their balance sheet asset .   the next refinement be base on Basle Accord risk - base capital standard -- adopt in 1988 and implement start in 1990 - -require bank to hold different amount of capital depend on the perceive credit risk of different on- and off - balance - sheet asset .   in addition , to reduce discretion in the enforcement of the standard and the closure of capital - impair bank , Congress include \" prompt corrective action \" provision in the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 ( FDICIA ) . under prompt corrective action , or PCA , bank with capital ratio below certain threshold value be subject to increasingly severe mandatory and discretionary sanction .   finally , risk - base capital standard which originally only cover credit risk be now be extend to cover market risk . the process by which the new market risk standard be arrive at be indicative of the new orientation toward incentive - base regulation , allow well capitalize , efficient bank to compete and impose cost more selectively on undercapitalized , poorly manage bank .   the standard also permit bank that be more efficient at monitor and control their risk to hold less capital than inefficient bank .   these regulatory standard be much like what the market would do in the absence of the safety net .   the new standard , which apply to bank with substantial trading , allow bank to use their own internal model of risk that be employ in their everyday operation to determine the capital requirement on their trading book .   this approach also reflect a new effort to develop refinement in regulatory standard in cooperation with the industry , in part by well understand the \" good practice \" that be evolve in the industry and use these as a basis for regulatory standard across the industry . a cumulative effect of the many change in capital regulation in the 1980 and early 1990 , as well as other factor , be that bank have much high capital ratio today than they do 15 year ago , and even 5 year ago .   this be especially true at the large banking organization .   for the banking industry as a whole , the equity - to - asset ratio rise from less than 6 percent at the end of the 1970 to over 8 percent in the mid-1990 .   for the large banking organization , the capital ratio rise from less than 4 percent to over 7 percent . return to topthe Implications of the Transformation of Banking for Bank Regulation we should not be too sanguine about bank capital , however .   while the current capital standard be significant improvement over what they replace , they be still base on broad one - size - fit - all rule .   moreover , the market have begin to focus more on the capital - risk trade - off : no large bank or parent banking organization , for example , have AAA long - term debt , and only a handful be rate AA , despite the capital ratio I just quote .   bank at the cutting edge be risk rate their loan portfolio and internally allocate capital to they for management and profitability analysis .   such allocation be superior way of develop capital allocation for individual bank . perhaps we will be able in the future to harness bank ’ internal capital allocation for regulatory purpose .   indeed , the reason for choose the topic I have discuss thus far be that these structural change represent an on - go process and be go to continue to challenge we in the future .   in the final portion of my remark , I will try to identify some of the most important challenge that regulator will face as a result of these change . maintain local competition in the face of continue bank consolidation first , with regard to future banking industry consolidation , the Riegle - Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 essentially expand the exist regional compact to the nation as a whole , and overturn the McFadden Act prohibition on interstate branching .   Interstate branching to almost all the state be permit as of June 1 , 1997 .   the removal of these artificial barrier to trade be beneficial and will likely improve efficiency and diversification of risk in the banking industry . the exact future structure of the banking industry be unknown , but presumably will be drive not just by the removal of legal barrier to competition , but by shift in technology , efficiency , and risk diversification .   the firm with the great managerial efficiency be expect to take over those with the low efficiency and improve they .   Research in banking suggest that these difference in managerial efficiency be much large than any scale and scope economy . various model predict that several thousand banking organization be likely to disappear under nationwide banking , but that the remain bank will still number in the thousand , as small community bank that serve their constituent well be likely to remain in business . there appear to be two key challenge to regulator regard consolidation .   the first be to be sure that there be adequate competition from bank and nonbank in local banking market . research have suggest that high local market concentration lead to price that be unfavorable to bank customer -- low deposit rate for retail depositor and high loan rate for small business loan .   high concentration may also lead to reduce managerial efficiency , as the price cushion provide by market power allow a \" quiet life \" for manager in which relatively little effort be require to be profitable .   insure an adequate amount of local - market competition be essential to avoid these potential problem . the second challenge bring on by consolidation be to make sure that merger and acquisition do not create excessive risk .   in this regard , it be important that capital be sufficient to cover any problem during the transition period when the bank and system be learn to work together , on top of the normal risk of ongoing operation . the interaction of bank power and bank structure the future expansion of banking organization power also raise some challenge to regulator . indeed , financial reform will likely be a high priority of the next Congress , perhaps include repeal of Glass - Steagall .   one of the result of financial reform , along the line of the bill Congressman Leach introduce last session , would be the emergence of financial service hold company that could include both commercial and investment bank .   there be also a prospect that bank might be able to expand into insurance activity as well .   this would take to a perhaps logical conclusion the recent blurring of the line between financial service firm . whether or not the Glass - Steagall Act be repeal , we face the challenge of insure that the propose recent expansion of bank power through section 20 subsidiary do not inadvertently expand the safety net protection afford to bank to protect other , previously nonbank , activity . this would give an unfair subsidy to banking organization . while there be no perfect system for allow financial intermediary to gain the most from the synergy of joint production while avoid expansion of the safety net , there be several step that seem likely to keep this problem under control .   first , we need to be sure to require plenty of capital in the bank to keep the value of access to the safety net low .   second , we need to provide reasonable insulation of the bank from the risk of the nonbanke enterprise .   the Board believe that the good way to do this be by place new activity in hold company subsidiary , rather than in the bank itself or its subsidiary .   the further the separation from the bank , the well be the insulation .   a third safeguard to protect the bank and prevent the expansion of the safety net subsidy be the adoption of prudential limitation through firewall and rule that prohibit or limit certain bank and affiliate transaction .   while firewall may temporarily bend under stress , they nonetheless serve a useful purpose .   on the other hand , we must strike a balance and not make the firewall so rigid that they would eliminate the economic synergy between the bank and their affiliate .   in this spirit , the Board last month make an effort to modify firewall to allow bank to achieve efficiency gain with respect to security underwriting in section 20 affiliate without create excessive risk . the issue of what bank structure be appropriate and prudent in light of expand banking power be a particularly controversial one .   while the Board ’s view that the expand power should be carry out only in subsidiary of the bank hold company be incorporate into the Congressman Leach ’s unsuccessful financial modernization bill in the last Congress , this preference be not share by all party to this debate .   some stress the cost associate with the hold company structure and   question its benefit from a safety and soundness perspective and , as a result , favor either allow the new activity to be carry out in a subsidiary of the bank itself or at least allow bank an option with respect to structural form . return to topstaye up - to - date in the supervision of bank risk management as financial product and practice evolve   there will undoubtedly be further development in the way that bank perform their core function of risk measurement , acceptance , and management as market continue to evolve improve \" good practice \" in deal with market and credit risk .   this evolution will continue to challenge regulator to keep capital standard and other risk monitoring and control mechanism from fall too far behind .   one particular challenge be that the continue development of derivative product and other mean of manage risk can also allow bank employee to take excessive risk and hide they from supervisor and perhaps from the owner of the bank .   it be difficult for regulator to quantify these risk , and even more difficult to design risk - base deposit insurance and risk - base capital system that accurately incorporate these risk . in response , regulator will need to stick with capital as the cornerstone of defense against bank risk , both to reduce moral hazard incentive and to provide a buffer stock to absorb loss .   a challenge will be to continue to update the capital standard in line with current or not - too - out - of - date risk measurement technique .   expansion of the recently implement \" internal model \" type of approach may be helpful in this regard , use , as I note early , bank ’ own risk measurement to help set their capital requirement .   in addition , many of the technique use to quantify and control market risk may be transferable for use in quantifying and control credit risk in the future . the task of measure capital and risk can also be make easy if bank portfolio be make somewhat more transparent .   increase transparency would also facilitate market discipline -- a highly desirable goal in our rapidly change financial environment .   a problem here be that it be not always clear how to well encourage transparency .   for example , partial market value accounting may involve more cost than benefit .   however , it seem clear that this be an issue that will remain on our plate for the foreseeable future . in addition , the capital standard can and should be augment by bank supervisor in individual case .   the risk - base capital standard and prompt corrective action rule be , and will remain , only minimum capital guideline for normal circumstance .   supervisor need to require additional capital when bank be explicitly take additional risk that be not capture by the guideline , or when bank risk be excessively opaque and it be too difficult to determine if excessive risk might be undertake .   to accomplish this , it be important to continue to examine bank on a regular basis .   there be simply no market substitute for the type of information that can be gather under the auspex of a bank examination with access to the complete record of a bank . however , as financial transaction become more complex , supervisor can not be expect to monitor every detail .   increasingly , supervisor will focus on bank ’ risk management procedure . bank will have to convince supervisor that they have prudent risk management procedure and policy and that the bank follow they .   increasingly , supervisor will emphasize your process of risk management and control , and proof that you be use those technique , in order to determine whether your capital be adequate for your risk profile and procedure . reduce the burden of regulation and increase the uniformity in regulation across banking agency while recent banking legislation significantly reduce the regulatory burden on the banking industry , we all realize that keep the cost of supervision and regulation low be an important on - go task for all party .   it be particularly important for the federal banking agency to continue effort at improve cooperation with each other , include standardization of certain policy and procedure and datum collection .   in short , we must try to reap the potential benefit of multiple regulator in term of encourage innovation and provide check and balance on regulatory excess , without incur the potential cost of \" competition in laxity \" and excessive overlap and duplication of effort .   I be optimistic that this can be do , perhaps by augment the role of the FFEIC.Return to top1996 Speeches     home | News and event   accessibility | contact Us   to comment on this site , please fill out our feedback form . last update : November 21 , 1996 2:00 pm'"
