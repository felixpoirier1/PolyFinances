This research seminar is part of the Federal Reserve\\'s series of events called \"Toward an Inclusive Recovery.\"\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nToday\\'s seminar, hosted by the Board of Governors, will focus on how the COVID-19 pandemic affected educational outcomes and the subsequent impact we anticipate for transitions to the labor force. We have invited accomplished researchers to discuss their workâ\\x80\\x94and what practical lessons might be drawn from itâ\\x80\\x94that could help inform community development practice and public policy considerations.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nAs I am sure you are aware, the pandemic created significant disruptions for our students and the education system. At the onset of the pandemic, steps taken to slow the spread of COVID-19 resulted in widespread closures of businesses and schools. Many, myself included, were immediately concerned about the negative effects on education from changes that included shifting to virtual instruction, lack of access to technology, and changes to the accessibility and provision of childcare. It is critical to consider that access to education at every step along a student\\'s learning path serves as a pipeline into the labor force and enables future generations of Americans to participate and thrive in our dynamic labor market. The disruption of education throughout the pandemic undoubtedly led to an absence of workers in the labor force, creating a shortage that held back the early economic recovery.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nEducation outcomes, including learning losses and achievements, take time to measure, aggregate, and analyze. As we enter the fourth academic year affected by the pandemic, data on student performance are becoming more available. Much of this early data confirms our initial concerns. For example, early test scores show that throughout the country nine-year-olds suffered a decline in learning outcomes during the pandemic. But other data also indicate that learning losses were unequal and disproportionately affected low-performing students and low-income students.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIt is likely that the sudden shift to online classes contributed to the learning declines. According to the Board\\'s 2020 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (the SHED), only 22 percent of parents with children attending virtual classes agreed that their children learned as much as they would have attending classes in person at school. I hope that the return to in-person learning and reopening of schools will enable children to resume normal learning and that academic achievement will rebound.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIt seems that even with this return to in-person attendance, many schools are struggling to provide students with the same quality of education as they did pre-pandemic. With the return to onsite education, many schools are confronting challenges that impair their ability to meet the educational needs of students. A number of educators appear to have left the profession, as indicated by the nearly 100,000 more job openings for teachers in July 2022 than before the pandemic.1\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nComplicating these issues, across the country the return to in-person instruction has been met by an increase in chronic absenteeism, which is defined as a student missing at least 10 percent of school days in a school year. Compared to a typical school year pre-pandemic, 72 percent of U.S. public schools reported an increase in chronic absenteeism among their students during the 2021â\\x80\\x9322 school year, which is a 39 percent increase over the previous year.2\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nMissed school typically means missed learning, so chronic absenteeism is a key metric of school performance. It\\'s likely that these challenges will result in lower graduation rates and possibly less stable employment than would have otherwise been the case.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThese outcomes raise difficult questions about how to best respond to the needs of students and educators going forward. For example, how can curricula be adjusted to meet students where they are today, after nearly three years of pandemic-impacted learning? How can we best re-engage the larger proportion of students who may have become disconnected as a result of these pandemic-related disruptions to their education? What does this all mean for the future of the labor force?\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIn addition to the challenges facing primary and secondary education, higher education was not immune to pandemic disruptions. Like K-12 education, studies show that online instruction reduced the academic performance of college students.3 In addition, we have seen declines in both college enrollment and the rate of first-year college students who continue their education into a second year.4 These declines are most pronounced at community colleges and open-access programs. Some of this decline was due to a supply-induced shortage resulting from colleges unable to offer remote learning options for many technical and vocational programs. The reduction in these \"hands-on\" programs, such as air-conditioning repair and auto detailing, had a greater impact on male enrollment and may lead to labor supply shortages for some of these skills-based professions.5\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nEducation is the greatest and most effective input into the future of our labor market. In order to have the strongest possible labor force in the future, it is critical to understand and act immediately to address the educational losses experienced during the pandemic. I\\'m sure there\\'s much to learn about how these education challenges, both longstanding and more recent, will ultimately affect the job market. That\\'s a question of particular interest to policymakers, and it\\'s one of the most important reasons that we host events like this seminar. I look forward to hearing from the experts we have invited here today to discuss ideas to successfully and quickly address academic declines, expand K-12 education options, improve higher education outcomes, and prepare this generation to participate and thrive in the future labor force.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551'"

      "text/plain": "'Remarks by Governor Lawrence B Lindsey At the Community Development Lending Conference Dallas Texas October  Here We Go AgainThank you  It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss some of the challenges that lie ahead in the areas of economic opportunity and community development   Frankly its a pleasure to be anywhere but Washington DC   Actually though in any year divisible by four the whole country gets to glimpse the craziness that has always been a way of life in our nations capitalOne of the problems that we have in Washington is that our focus is short term limited only to the next election  Anything that could happen more than four years into the future doesnt register on the collective consciousness  And frankly this time frame has gotten shorter and shorter in an age of nightly polling and focus groupsBut Americas cities are a testament to the effects policies enacted in the rush to the next election can have as well as proof positive that trends that occur in a single economic cycle can last a long time  Our successes like our failures often occur over decades   And if we are really to be successful in our community development activities we must take a much longer view bearing in mind the problems that may arise as unintended consequences in the years ahead result from the political and economic environment in which we find ourselves todayNow is a particularly appropriate time to look ahead and make plans because a confluence of forces are providing an array of opportunities that are historically unprecedented  The community development industry has finally gotten its legs and has the possibility to grow and make a lasting contribution to the revitalization of America at a magnitude heretofore unimagined  But if community development is going to succeed in an area where real success is measured in decades it had better look ahead to a period when times will not be as propitious as they are currentlyLet me begin with some good news  Access to credit by those individuals and communities that are the target of our economic development efforts has reached unprecedented levels  One can see this from a variety of sources  This summer  the financial regulators again released their annual report on the number of home mortgages granted the preceding year  The data for  indicate that in a year when the number of conventional home purchase loans decreased overall from  lending to African Americans Hispanics and Native Americans went up  The  figures are part of a four year trend with mortgages granted to these groups on a steady upswing including significant double digit increases from  to While one can never tell for certain what the right number of home mortgages given in a particular year should be even some simple adjustments for income and demographic factors suggest that the numbers show that we have reached a point where race or ethnic based discrepancies seem to have largely disappeared  For example if one takes the market for conventional non government assisted loans as being families who earned  or more in  then the proportion of such families getting mortgages in  was  percent for whites  percent for blacks and  percent for Hispanics  Including all mortgages  conventional and government assisted  and dropping the income threshold to   shows that  percent of whites  percent of blacks and  percent of Hispanics got mortgages in   Confining the base to married families with children those most likely to be in the market produces an even more compelling case that disparities have largely disappearedBut the large increases in homeownership possibilities are not the only evidence of widescale increases in the extension of credit to traditionally underserved markets  While we do not directly collect racial and ethnic data on nonhousing extensions of credit evidence from the Federal Reserves Survey of Consumer Finances gives good reason to believe that the penetration of underserved markets in the credit card business was as dramatic and preceded the large scale increases in mortgage credit  The survey is taken every three years including   The preceding two surveys in  and  showed that the proportion of white families with outstanding credit card debt rose only slightly   percent in  and  percent in   In  this proportion was  percent   But the growth in credit card use as a source of finance among nonwhites was substantial The proportion of nonwhite families having outstanding credit card balances rose from  percent in  to  percent in  and to  percent in   Of course the numbers of people actually having credit cards is much higher  This suggests that a potentially debilitating economic burden has been lifted from a significant share of the population who can now meet economic emergencies and time their purchases with greater easeA Confluence of Events \\tWhy has all of this occurred just now  A part of me would like to conclude that this is the result of a permanent change in attitudes in America  While I certainly believe that we are a more enlightened country than five or ten or twenty years ago that our collective consciousness has been raised if you will I do not believe that this is the whole story   And there are particular pitfalls to the community development industry in believing that it can rely on an increased nobility of purpose to sustain its missionIn the short term one can rely on a sense of guilt or charity or a fear of enforcement action to motivate behavior  But it will not last  The only permanent motivating force in this world is self interest  Individuals enter into and stick with long term cooperative agreements only because they are mutually beneficial  Recently we have enjoyed a set of both micro and macro economic conditions that set the stage for a whole new set of  mutually beneficial relationships to emerge   But those fortuitous economic conditions will not last forever  We will be successful only if we cement in place long term mutually beneficial relationships that can survive an adverse turn in economic eventsWithout any question the most important economic development has been a decline in the underlying rate of inflation and the consequent decline in medium  and long term interest rates  Lets do the standard math involved in any home financing decision  In  fixed thirty year mortgage rates averaged  percent  Recently they have been around  percent  The principal and interest payments on a  mortgage declined from  to   Using a standard set of assumptions regarding property tax and insurance payments and a PITI to income ratio of  percent the annual qualifying income for this mortgage has fallen from  to   That  decline in qualifying income comes at a very dense part of the income distribution particularly in the minority population  And when one considers mortgage market innovations that have eased traditional underwriting constraints the increased opportunity that results from lower inflation and lower long term rates is even more amplifiedLet me use these figures to stress something that I have learned as a Federal Reserve Governor and as someone active in promoting homeownership opportunities to low  and moderate income Americans  There is a school of thought among some politicians that fighting inflation is bad for low  and moderate income people  But the reduction in inflation during the s and the continuation of that policy during the s has done more for homeownership opportunities among low  and moderate income groups than any program administered by the governmentIt is important to stress the differential impact of inflation between those who already have their homes and those who are seeking to buy  Our system of long term fixed interest rates and the home mortgage interest deduction makes increasing inflation highly profitable to those who already have financed their homes  That is why we all grew up being taught that homes were a great inflation hedge  If however you are simply in the market for physical shelter and not a tax shelter or inflation shelter high inflation and consequently higher long term interest rates prices you out of qualifying for a home  Furthermore if your income is fairly moderate you may not even qualify for the home mortgage interest deduction  Thus a low inflation environment is a key to maintaining homeownership opportunities  While the commitment of the Federal Reserve to preserving a low inflation environment is unwavering I cannot assure you that all politicians feel the same way  Nor can I guarantee you that sustaining the fight against inflation will not mean a temporary rise in interest rates at some time in the futureThe second major change has been a shift in attitudes among bankers and their regulators  The regulatory environment has moved dramatically from an overarching concern for bad loans on the books of the nations banks to one which focuses on regulatory concerns more friendly to community development such as CRA and fair lending  Just four years ago as we were working on the implementation of FDICIA legislation the regulatory staff was proposing adopting maximum loan to value ratios for mortgages  The Senate Banking Committee had recommended an  percent cap on such LTVs  In essence all home mortgages would have to have been accompanied by a  percent down payment   Can you imagine the state of the community development industry if these ideas had been implementedToday of course with the nations banks enjoying unprecedented health the focus of regulatory and political concern has changed  We have recently completed an extended period of revamping and strengthening the Community Reinvestment Act regulations  Detailed analysis of bank lending practices down to the census tract level is now a part of our regulatory mission  Fair lending enforcement has been significantly enhanced and is now using statistical practices that are state of the art in all of their technical legal and econometric aspectsA similar change has occurred among the nations banks  As other lines of bank lending have seen increasing competition and entry by nonbank financial service providers the focus of bank lending has moved to the consumer  In  just  percent of total bank loans were consumer debt based  including mortgages   That figure rose to  percent five years ago and is  percent today  In addition the securitization of consumer debt instruments for resale in the capital markets has increased both the willingness and the ability of banks to make such loansBut just like the business cycle the regulatory and banking cycle will not always be as favorable to consumer lending and community development as it is today  The early signs are already in place  Consumer debt to income ratios are now at record levels  Debt service ratios are back to the levels they reached just before the last recession  Bankruptcies are at record highs  As a result for the first time in this business cycle banks are no longer on net making consumer credit more accessible but are instead beginning to cut back  The political tide has also turned  Last December Congressman Kennedy held a forum at which I testified in which his theme was that banks were extending too much credit  Chairman Leach of the House Banking Committee held formal hearings last month on the consumer credit situation where bipartisan concern was expressed about the sustainability of existing consumer debt practicesSome Previous Cycles \\tThe reason that we should all be concerned is that history teaches us that these cyclical swings can have some pretty profound effects  I have had other occasions to talk about some of the financial innovations that have played a role in shaping the urban landscape over the past century  Today I would like to broaden that analysis to look at swings in public policy and the related swings in the community development and housing markets  I am going to focus on two particular cycles to give a flavor for the type of trends we should be looking for  The first is the Urban Renewal cycle of the s and early s  The second is the Great Society cycle of the late s and early sThe Urban Renewal cycle started with the Housing Act of   It declared that a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family was to be a  national goal  Title I of the act was labeled Urban Redevelopment and it was designed to clear slums and deal with two perceived problems  the high cost of land and the existence of parcels of land in cities that were considered too small to meet perceived modern needs  More than half of the federal money spent on urban renewal in the first dozen years of the act went to the purchase of propertyWhile the urban planning theory behind the legislation may have seemed laudable the actual implementation produced a very different result  Between  and  some  units of housing nearly all of them occupied by low income households were torn down while only  new housing units were built on the sites  Further well over half of the new homes were for upper income groups  In its implementation urban renewal was targeted at improving the commercial attractiveness of downtown areas  The price paid for this gamble on redeveloping downtown was a reduction in the availability of low income housingUltimately this gamble on the commercial position of downtown proved a loser as commerce switched to the shopping centers located on the fringes of towns  In large part this was the inevitable result of suburbanization  There is no question that widespread auto ownership the baby boom and the tastes of the public to achieve the American dream of a home in the suburbs were the main driving forces here  But government policy helped  The Depression Era housing legislation that established the savings and loan industry created a natural market niche for middle income home lending  Long term mortgages at roughly   percent were common  This system would work well from a financing point of view until the mid sixties primarily because of stable interest rates favorable demographics and general prosperityOf course this was only true of the finance end of the delivery system  In terms of social justice the story was quite different  The FHAs official manual of the s and s explicitly sought to keep neighborhoods occupied by the same social and racial classes in the name of neighborhood stability  The manual even encouraged the use of a model covenant prohibiting the mixing of races  Although restrictive covenants were outlawed in the late s and the FHA would not insure properties covered by them by early  this did not put an end to segregated developments  The fact is that only  percent of the new FHA insured houses were open to blacks between  and What one could call the Urban Renewal Cycle or more aptly the Suburb Creation Cycle of housing policy came to an end in the second half of the s  Both economic and social trends changed to make the old cycle unsustainable  On the social side the political neglect of the inner cities was brought to an end  Between  and  widespread urban disturbances occurred in many cities  in the United States  The result was a spate of commissions and legislation to address urban needs  For example the Department of Housing and Urban Development was established  The Model Cities Program was authorized in   A ten year goal of  million new and rehabbed housing units was setOn the economic side the combination of inflation and government regulation of interest rates produced rapid disintermediation of funds out of the housing market in the late s  To ease those constraints the savings and loan industry was allowed to offer a  basis point premium over commercial banks to attract deposits  But even this proved insufficient as the problem of housing access was hindered by the outmoded Depression Era delivery system of finance   In  which was otherwise a boom year for the US economy real residential investment ran  percent below its  pace  And for the entire period of the late s housing starts ran almost one third below their  peak  Needless to say this combination of social and economic forces created political pressure for change that became irresistible and the Great Society cycle began  In  Congress allowed the FHA to adjust the ceiling mortgage rate above the statutory rate  It also authorized section  allowing HUD to provide mortgage assistance to allow the interest rate paid by the buyer to be as low as  percent and the downpayment to be as low as   For all intents and purposes a flood of essentially free money began pouring into the housing market  This rapid political response and flood of government money created problems of its own  By December  the natural abuses of section  became apparent  A report to the House Banking Committee concluded The Department of Housing and Urban Development and its Federal Housing Administration may be well on its way toward insuring itself into a national housing scandal FHA has allowed real estate speculation of the worst type to go on  Substandard homes bearing inflated mortgages coupled with the practice of flipping by unscrupulous speculators was the natural result of this virtually free access to funds  A  internal HUD audit indicated that HUD was paying substantial premiums for the design and construction of multifamily projects  Press articles appeared that referred to HUD as the nations largest slumlordSo the Great Society cycle of massive urban housing subsidies came to a crashing end with a de facto housing moratorium in   Donald Sullivan in his article on housing in the s contained in Gertrude Fishs The Story of Housing summed up the lesson we should all learn very well  In designing  programs to allow low and moderate income Americans to participate in the dream of homeownership few realized that a tighter control or performance system would be necessary for monitoring purposes  Federal money suddenly became available  as well as FHA insurance  The granting of FHA insurance to homes of such poor quality that they clearly would not survive the life of the mortgage was basically fraudThe effect of this boom bust cycle on our nations cities was horrendous  Chicagos Mayor Richard Daley told a Senate committee in  Most major cities in the US have been left with thousands of abandoned and vandalized structures in what had been desirable neighborhoods  Les Coplan of the San Francisco Home Loan Bank testified We had  foreclosures in Oakland  Some of them were section  loans the rest resulted from the breakdowns that followed The key fact that Coplan was on to was that if defaults and foreclosures reach a crucial level not only those who default turn out to be losers  A neighborhood cannot survive when a number of its homes become abandoned  They quickly become targets for vandals and now in the s become havens for the drug trade  The result is a decline in the entire neighborhood as it becomes a less desirable place to live  Deteriorating property values lead to increasingly risky lending conditions a natural cutback in capital and still further declines in property valuesHere We Go Again \\tAll of this history should lead us to some sobering reflection  Are we now at another peak and about to enter another crash in the economic political and regulatory underpinnings of our urban redevelopment and homeownership efforts   There is at least superficial resemblance to the two earlier cycles I discussed  The economics most closely resembles the s cycle of low interest rates coupled with low inflation  The politics and regulatory environment most closely resembles the late s when efforts to channel funds to urban redevelopment were most desirable  My suspicion is that in spite of these comparisons we still have some time if we act prudently to prevent problems in the future  I suggest three stepsFirst I think that it is vital for all of us to realize that a low inflation environment is crucial to urban redevelopment and homeownership opportunities for low  and moderate income individuals  Unfortunately some of those politicians who express the most concern about these issues do not understand this fact  The political temptation to try to solve economic problems with the printing press is probably as old as government but it simply does not work  And bad as it is for the economy at large it is a disaster for the stability required for financing homeownership opportunities to those on the first rung of  the economic ladderSecond it is crucial that urban development practitioners seek permanent partners in the private market  To do so they must rely on the only thing that achieves this permanence  the establishment of mutual self interest  not charity and not a regulatory club  I have often heard and am sympathetic to the argument that CRA is needed to get the attention of banks and get them to the table  Well we have gotten their attention and they are at the table  Now it is the responsibility of urban redevelopment practitioners to keep them thereThird we must avoid overpromising and overcommitting  We do no one any favors by putting a family that is not ready or able to carry the responsibilities of homeownership into a home of their own  If that family does not make it it is economically socially and spiritually devastated  If there are enough of these families the entire neighborhood may suffer  Whether it is homeownership or small business creation the binding constraint we now face is not access to financial capital it is access to human capital  Neither the problems of our cities nor the success of our nation as a whole resulted from some sudden action  It required a long patient process involving a lot of hard work  Today we must rededicate ourselves to these principles  We do this not because we feel the job isnt worth doing but because it is the only way the job will ever get doneReturn to top Speeches     Home  News and events  Accessibility

      "text/plain": "'The Role for Structural Macroeconomic ModelsI am in the middle of my third interesting and active encounter with the development andor use of macroeconometric models for forecasting and policy analysis My journey began at MIT as a research assistant to Professors Franco Modigiliani and Albert Ando during the period of development of the MPS model continued at Laurence H Meyer Associates with the development of The Washington University Macro Model under the direction of my partner Joel Prakken and the use of that model for both forecasting and policy analysis and now has taken me to the Board of Governors where macro models have long played an important role in forecasting and policy analysis and the MPS model has recently been replaced by the FRBUS modelI bring to this panel a perspective shaped by both my earlier experience and my new responsibilities I will focus my presentation on the role of structural macro models in the monetary policy process compare the use of models at the Board with their use at Laurence H Meyer Associates and discuss how the recently introduced innovations in the Federal Reserve model might further advance the usefulness of models in the monetary policy processI Structural Models and Monetary Policy AnalysisI want to focus on three contributions of models to the monetary policy process as an input to the forecast process as a vehicle for analyzing alternative scenarios and a vehicle for developing a strategy for implementing monetary policy that disciplines the juggling of multiple objectives and ensures a bridge from short run policy to long run objectives The forecast context for monetary policy decisions Because monetary policy has the ability to adjust quickly to changing economic conditions and because lags in the response to monetary policy make it important that monetary policy be forward looking monetary policy is very much influenced both by incoming data and by forecasts of spending and price developments Forecasts are central to monetary policy setting Models make a valuable contribution to forecasting Therefore models can make an important contribution to the setting of monetary policyModels capture historical regularities identify key assumptions that must be made to condition the forecast embody estimates of the effects of past and future policy actions on the economy and provide a disciplined approach to learning from past errors I attribute much of the forecasting success of myself and my partners at LHMA to the way in which we allowed our model to discipline our judgment in making the forecast A model also helps to defend and communicate the forecast by providing a coherent story that ties together the details of the forecast It also helps to isolate the source of disagreements about the forecast helping to separate differences in assumptions oil prices fiscal policy etc from disagreements about the structure of the economy or judgments about special factors that the model may not fully captureAt the Board the staff forecast presented in the Greenbook prior to each of the eight FOMC meetings each year is fundamentally judgmental It is developed by a team of sector specialists who consult but are not bound by a number of structural econometric equations describing their sectors and further armed in some cases with reduced form equations and atheoretical time series models The team develops the forecast within the context of agreed upon conditioning assumptions including for example a path for short term interest rates fiscal policy oil prices and foreign economic policies They begin with an income constraint and then participate in an interactive process of revisions to ensure that the aggregation of sector forecasts is consistent with the evolving forecast for the overall level of outputModels play an important supporting role in the development of the staff forecast A separate model group uses a formal structural macroeconometric model the FRBUS Model to make a pure model forecast which is also available to the FOMC and is an input to the judgmental forecast process The model forecast is conditioned by the same set of assumptions as the judgmental forecast and statistical models are used to generate the path of adjustment factors avoiding any role for judgment in the forecast The members of the model group also actively participate in the discussions as the judgmental forecast evolves focusing in particular on the consistency between the adjustment factors that would be required to impose the judgmental forecast on the model and the pattern of adjustment factors in the pure model forecastThere are two important differences from the private sector use of models for forecasting at least based on my experience at LHMA First the staff is not truly making a forecast of economic activity prices etc because the staff forecast is usually conditioned on an unchanged path of the funds rate Thus the staff is projecting how the economy would evolve if there were no change in the federal funds rate which does not even always translate cleanly into no change in monetary policy The rationale for this procedure is to separate the forecast process from the policy making process and therefore avoid appearing to prejudge the FOMCs decisions This procedure may be modified when there is a strong presumption that conditions will unambiguously call for significant action if the Committee is to achieve its objectives But it does nevertheless make the forecast process at the Board fundamentally different from that in the private sector where one of the key decisions in the forecast is the direction of monetary policy It is ironic that at the Board where the staff is presumably more knowledgeable about the direction of policy than in the private sector forecasting is constrained from using that information in developing the forecast On the other hand the practice at the Board may be very well suited to the process of making policy by forcing the FOMC to confront the implications of maintaining an unchanged path for the funds rateA second difference relative to my experience in the private sector has to do with the way in which judgment and model interact in the development of the forecast My first impression of the process at the Board was that the judgmental team made its forecast without a model and the model team made its forecast without judgment leaving the blending of model and judgment to be worked out in the process of discussion and iteration as the judgmental group looks at the model output and the model group joins the discussion of the forecast The process is I have come to appreciate more complicated and subtle than this caricature For example when there have been important shocks eg unexpected rise in oil prices or an increase in the minimum wage model simulations of the effect of the shocks will provide a point of departure for the initial judgmental forecast But it is nevertheless a different way of combining model and judgment than we used at LHMA where the model played a more central role in the forecast process An advantage of the Boards approach is that it makes the forecast less dependent on a single model perhaps desirable given the diversity of views on the FOMC and forces recognition of uncertainties in the outlook when alternative sector models yield very different forecastsReturn to top Policy alternatives and alternative scenarios to support FOMC policy decisions A second valuable contribution of models is to provide alternative scenarios around a base forecast I will focus on three examples of this use models at the Board though there is also of course widespread use of alternative model based scenario analysis in the private sectorFirst the staff regularly provides alternative forecasts roughly corresponding to the policy options that will be considered at the upcoming FOMC meeting The staff first imposes the judgmental forecast on the FRBUS model and then uses the model to provide alternative scenarios for a policy of rising rates and a policy of declining rates bracketing the staff forecast which assumes an unchanged federal funds rate While this is the most direct use of the model in the forecast process it is recognized that it has become a problematical one especially given the structure of the new FRSUS model that otherwise treats policy as determined by a rule a prerequisite to the forward looking approach to expectations formation that is a major innovation in the new model Indeed it might well be that the presentation of a forecast that incorporates a simple monetary policy rule might be a more useful complement to the staffs judgmental forecast than the mechanical bracketing of the judgmental forecast with pre determined paths of rising or falling ratesSecond the staff on occasion uses the model to provide information about the projected effects of significant contingencies eg the return of Iraq to oil exporting under the UN agreement for humanitarian aid or the effect of an increase in the minimum wage Models are particularly well suited to providing this informationThird the model can be used to evaluate the consistency of alternative policies with the Federal Reserves long run objective of price stability One of the challenges of monetary policy making is to ensure that the meeting to meeting policy deliberations maintain a disciplined focus on the Federal Reserves long term price stability objective To facilitate this focus five year simulations under alternative policy assumptions are generally run semi annually to coincide with the FOMC meetings preceding the preparation of the Humphrey Hawkins report and the Chairmans testimony on monetary policy before Congress These simulations have recently focused on policy options allowing for more gradual or more rapid convergence over time to long run inflation targets allowing the FOMC to focus on both the different time paths to achieve the long run objective and the alternative paths of output and employment during the transition to the long run targetReturn to top Policy rules to inform discretionary monetary policy A third contribution of models to the monetary policy process is through simulations with alternative rules for Federal Reserve action At LHMA we designed our model to offer users four policy regimes setting paths for the money supply nonborrowed reserves or the federal funds rate or turning on a reaction according to which the federal funds rate responds to developments in output unemployment and inflation While we increasingly used the reaction in our analysis of alternative fiscal policies we did not routinely take advantage of the reaction to forecast monetary policy Another irony is that there is a much more active interest in the implications of monetary policy rules at the Board where discretionary policy is made than in the private sector where estimated rules might be effectively used to forecast monetary policyThe staff has examined a number of alternative rules including those based on monetary aggregates commodity prices exchange rates nominal income and most recently Taylor type rules These rules in effect adjust the real federal funds rate relative to some long run equilibrium level in response to the gaps between actual and potential output and between inflation and some long run inflation targetSuch a rule can be interpreted as either a descriptive or normative guide to policy If the parameters of the policy rule are estimated over some recent sample period the rule may describe the average response of the FOMC over the period Alternatively parameters can be derived from some optimizing framework dependent on a specific objective and model of the economy Stochastic simulations with such a rule can provide some confidence that following the rule will contribute to both short run stabilization and long term inflation goals in response to historical shocks to the economy and the rule in turn can provide discipline to discretionary policy by providing guidance on when and how aggressively to move interest rates in response to movements in output and inflationThe focus on rules is much more important under an interest rate operating procedure than under an operating procedure focused directly on monetary aggregate targets and is also more important under an interest rate operating procedure when the monetary aggregates as has been the case for some time do not bear a stable relationship to overall economic performance and therefore do not provide useful information about when and how aggressively to change interest rates Taylor type rules in this environment provide a disciplined approach to varying interest rates in response to economic developments that both ensures a pro cyclical response of interest rates to demand shocks and imposes a nominal anchor in much the same way as would be the case under a monetary aggregate strategy with a stable money demand For this reason I like to refer to the strategy implicit in such rules as monetarism without moneyThis should not suggest that we can write a rule that is appropriate in all circumstances to all varieties of shocks and to all the varieties of cyclical experience Rules at best can discipline judgment rather than replace judgment A particular problem with Taylor type rules is that we do not know the equilibrium real federal funds rate and whatever it might be at one point in time it likely varies over time There is considerable research under way at the Board in an effort to find specifications and parameters for rules which achieve an efficient balancing of inflation and output variability and provide guidance about patterns and aggressiveness of interest rate adjustments consistent with the stabilizing properties of high performing rulesReturn to topII The FRB US Model Rational Expectations in a Sticky Price ModelThe newly redesigned model at the Board the FRB US model replaces the MPS model The MPS model developed in the mid to late s revolutionized macroeconometric modeling and set the standard for a considerable period of time The Board participated in the development of the MPS model and then became its home and the Board staff kept the faith alive during the lean years when such models lost respectability in academic circles even as their usefulness and value in forecasting and practical policy analysis was growing in the real world The FRB US model retains much of the underlying structure in terms of equilibrium relationships and even more of the fundamental simulation properties of the MPS model but significantly modernizes the estimation of the model and the treatment of expectationsThe vision in the new work is to separate macro dynamics into adjustment cost and expectations formation components with adjustment costs imposing a degree of inertia and expectations introducing a forward looking element into the dynamics The net result is a structure that integrates rational expectations into a sticky price model In this respect the new model follows closely the approach pioneered by John Taylor Finally the estimation technique makes use of co integration and an error correction frameworkFinancial and exchange rate relationships are based on arbitrage equations with no adjustment costs but with explicitly forward looking expectations The specification of nonfinancial equations in contrast incorporates both adjustment costs and rational expectationsRational expectations are implemented in two alternative ways First expectations can be specified as model consistent expectations that is the expectations about future inflation can be set to equal future inflation perfect foresight through iterative solutions of the model Model consistent expectations may but need not assume that the private sector has complete knowledge of the policy rule being followed by the Federal Reserve In the second approach expectations are also viewed as being model consistent but in this case the model relevant to expectations is not precisely the same as the FRBUS model Instead expectations are formed based on a simpler VAR model of the economy The VAR model always includes three variables the output gap a short term interest rate and inflation When expectations of additional sector specific variables are required the system is expanded to include the additional variable A unique aspect of the VAR expectations is that these equations also incorporate explicit forward looking information through an error correction specification For example the VAR equations include a term for the gap between actual inflation and the publics long run expectations of inflation based on survey measures of long run inflation expectations which in turn might be viewed as based on a combination of the publics perception of the Federal Reserves reaction including its tolerance of inflation over the long run The equations also include the gap between actual short term interest rates and the publics long run expectations of short term rates gleaned from the yield curveThe model retains the neo Classical synthesis vision of the MPS model short run output dynamics based on sticky prices and long run Classical properties associated with price flexibility and therefore produces multiplier results both in the short and longer runs that are very similar to those produced by the MPS model The result is that the model produces for the most part what may be the best of two worlds a modern form and traditional results But the better articulated role of expectations in the new model also allows a richer analysis of the response to those policy actions which might have immediate impacts on inflation andor interest rate expectationsThe model has several advantages The first is it may be more credible to a wider audience because of its modernization in terms of cointegration and error learning specification on the one hand and explicit use of rational expectations on the other hand Second the model is much more flexible in terms of research potential It allows one to study in particular how the response to monetary or fiscal policies depends on features of the expectation formation process Third the model forces the user to make assumptions explicitly about expectations formation that otherwise could be avoided or hiddenLet me give two examples of policy options that can be analyzed more effectively in the new model First consider a deficit reduction package that is credible and promises to lower interest rates in the future In models like MPS and WUMM the mechanical fiscal policy simulation would ignore any bond market effect associated with changed expectations about future short term rates One could of course add factor downward the long term bond rate in the term structure equation to impose a bond market effect but the structure of the model neither immediately points you in this direction nor provides any guidance about how to intervene In FRB US in contrast one cannot avoid making an explicit assumption about the credibility of such a policy through assumptions about future short term interest rates in the VAR expectations or in the context of model consistent expectations and the assumption made about credibility will importantly affect the short run dynamics though not the long run effects of the policySecond consider the transitional costs of reducing inflation The transitional effects on output depend importantly on the assumptions made about the credibility of the inflation commitment Note however that there are significant transitional output costs of disinflation even under full credibility and the model consistent specification of rational expectations arising from the sticky price implication of the adjustment cost specification For my part I prefer the FRB US simulations based on limited rather than perfect credibility because I do not believe that credibility effects significantly diminish the transition costs of lowering inflation But I also value having a disciplined approach to showing how the costs of disinflation would vary with the differing degrees of credibility'"

      "text/plain": "'The Role for Structural Macroeconomic ModelsI am in the middle of my third interesting and active encounter with the development andor use of macroeconometric models for forecasting and policy analysis My journey began at MIT as a research assistant to Professors Franco Modigiliani and Albert Ando during the period of development of the MPS model continued at Laurence H Meyer Associates with the development of The Washington University Macro Model under the direction of my partner Joel Prakken and the use of that model for both forecasting and policy analysis and now has taken me to the Board of Governors where macro models have long played an important role in forecasting and policy analysis and the MPS model has recently been replaced by the FRBUS modelI bring to this panel a perspective shaped by both my earlier experience and my new responsibilities I will focus my presentation on the role of structural macro models in the monetary policy process compare the use of models at the Board with their use at Laurence H Meyer Associates and discuss how the recently introduced innovations in the Federal Reserve model might further advance the usefulness of models in the monetary policy processI Structural Models and Monetary Policy AnalysisI want to focus on three contributions of models to the monetary policy process as an input to the forecast process as a vehicle for analyzing alternative scenarios and a vehicle for developing a strategy for implementing monetary policy that disciplines the juggling of multiple objectives and ensures a bridge from short run policy to long run objectives The forecast context for monetary policy decisions Because monetary policy has the ability to adjust quickly to changing economic conditions and because lags in the response to monetary policy make it important that monetary policy be forward looking monetary policy is very much influenced both by incoming data and by forecasts of spending and price developments Forecasts are central to monetary policy setting Models make a valuable contribution to forecasting Therefore models can make an important contribution to the setting of monetary policyModels capture historical regularities identify key assumptions that must be made to condition the forecast embody estimates of the effects of past and future policy actions on the economy and provide a disciplined approach to learning from past errors I attribute much of the forecasting success of myself and my partners at LHMA to the way in which we allowed our model to discipline our judgment in making the forecast A model also helps to defend and communicate the forecast by providing a coherent story that ties together the details of the forecast It also helps to isolate the source of disagreements about the forecast helping to separate differences in assumptions oil prices fiscal policy etc from disagreements about the structure of the economy or judgments about special factors that the model may not fully captureAt the Board the staff forecast presented in the Greenbook prior to each of the eight FOMC meetings each year is fundamentally judgmental It is developed by a team of sector specialists who consult but are not bound by a number of structural econometric equations describing their sectors and further armed in some cases with reduced form equations and atheoretical time series models The team develops the forecast within the context of agreed upon conditioning assumptions including for example a path for short term interest rates fiscal policy oil prices and foreign economic policies They begin with an income constraint and then participate in an interactive process of revisions to ensure that the aggregation of sector forecasts is consistent with the evolving forecast for the overall level of outputModels play an important supporting role in the development of the staff forecast A separate model group uses a formal structural macroeconometric model the FRBUS Model to make a pure model forecast which is also available to the FOMC and is an input to the judgmental forecast process The model forecast is conditioned by the same set of assumptions as the judgmental forecast and statistical models are used to generate the path of adjustment factors avoiding any role for judgment in the forecast The members of the model group also actively participate in the discussions as the judgmental forecast evolves focusing in particular on the consistency between the adjustment factors that would be required to impose the judgmental forecast on the model and the pattern of adjustment factors in the pure model forecastThere are two important differences from the private sector use of models for forecasting at least based on my experience at LHMA First the staff is not truly making a forecast of economic activity prices etc because the staff forecast is usually conditioned on an unchanged path of the funds rate Thus the staff is projecting how the economy would evolve if there were no change in the federal funds rate which does not even always translate cleanly into no change in monetary policy The rationale for this procedure is to separate the forecast process from the policy making process and therefore avoid appearing to prejudge the FOMCs decisions This procedure may be modified when there is a strong presumption that conditions will unambiguously call for significant action if the Committee is to achieve its objectives But it does nevertheless make the forecast process at the Board fundamentally different from that in the private sector where one of the key decisions in the forecast is the direction of monetary policy It is ironic that at the Board where the staff is presumably more knowledgeable about the direction of policy than in the private sector forecasting is constrained from using that information in developing the forecast On the other hand the practice at the Board may be very well suited to the process of making policy by forcing the FOMC to confront the implications of maintaining an unchanged path for the funds rateA second difference relative to my experience in the private sector has to do with the way in which judgment and model interact in the development of the forecast My first impression of the process at the Board was that the judgmental team made its forecast without a model and the model team made its forecast without judgment leaving the blending of model and judgment to be worked out in the process of discussion and iteration as the judgmental group looks at the model output and the model group joins the discussion of the forecast The process is I have come to appreciate more complicated and subtle than this caricature For example when there have been important shocks eg unexpected rise in oil prices or an increase in the minimum wage model simulations of the effect of the shocks will provide a point of departure for the initial judgmental forecast But it is nevertheless a different way of combining model and judgment than we used at LHMA where the model played a more central role in the forecast process An advantage of the Boards approach is that it makes the forecast less dependent on a single model perhaps desirable given the diversity of views on the FOMC and forces recognition of uncertainties in the outlook when alternative sector models yield very different forecastsReturn to top Policy alternatives and alternative scenarios to support FOMC policy decisions A second valuable contribution of models is to provide alternative scenarios around a base forecast I will focus on three examples of this use models at the Board though there is also of course widespread use of alternative model based scenario analysis in the private sectorFirst the staff regularly provides alternative forecasts roughly corresponding to the policy options that will be considered at the upcoming FOMC meeting The staff first imposes the judgmental forecast on the FRBUS model and then uses the model to provide alternative scenarios for a policy of rising rates and a policy of declining rates bracketing the staff forecast which assumes an unchanged federal funds rate While this is the most direct use of the model in the forecast process it is recognized that it has become a problematical one especially given the structure of the new FRSUS model that otherwise treats policy as determined by a rule a prerequisite to the forward looking approach to expectations formation that is a major innovation in the new model Indeed it might well be that the presentation of a forecast that incorporates a simple monetary policy rule might be a more useful complement to the staffs judgmental forecast than the mechanical bracketing of the judgmental forecast with pre determined paths of rising or falling ratesSecond the staff on occasion uses the model to provide information about the projected effects of significant contingencies eg the return of Iraq to oil exporting under the UN agreement for humanitarian aid or the effect of an increase in the minimum wage Models are particularly well suited to providing this informationThird the model can be used to evaluate the consistency of alternative policies with the Federal Reserves long run objective of price stability One of the challenges of monetary policy making is to ensure that the meeting to meeting policy deliberations maintain a disciplined focus on the Federal Reserves long term price stability objective To facilitate this focus five year simulations under alternative policy assumptions are generally run semi annually to coincide with the FOMC meetings preceding the preparation of the Humphrey Hawkins report and the Chairmans testimony on monetary policy before Congress These simulations have recently focused on policy options allowing for more gradual or more rapid convergence over time to long run inflation targets allowing the FOMC to focus on both the different time paths to achieve the long run objective and the alternative paths of output and employment during the transition to the long run targetReturn to top Policy rules to inform discretionary monetary policy A third contribution of models to the monetary policy process is through simulations with alternative rules for Federal Reserve action At LHMA we designed our model to offer users four policy regimes setting paths for the money supply nonborrowed reserves or the federal funds rate or turning on a reaction according to which the federal funds rate responds to developments in output unemployment and inflation While we increasingly used the reaction in our analysis of alternative fiscal policies we did not routinely take advantage of the reaction to forecast monetary policy Another irony is that there is a much more active interest in the implications of monetary policy rules at the Board where discretionary policy is made than in the private sector where estimated rules might be effectively used to forecast monetary policyThe staff has examined a number of alternative rules including those based on monetary aggregates commodity prices exchange rates nominal income and most recently Taylor type rules These rules in effect adjust the real federal funds rate relative to some long run equilibrium level in response to the gaps between actual and potential output and between inflation and some long run inflation targetSuch a rule can be interpreted as either a descriptive or normative guide to policy If the parameters of the policy rule are estimated over some recent sample period the rule may describe the average response of the FOMC over the period Alternatively parameters can be derived from some optimizing framework dependent on a specific objective and model of the economy Stochastic simulations with such a rule can provide some confidence that following the rule will contribute to both short run stabilization and long term inflation goals in response to historical shocks to the economy and the rule in turn can provide discipline to discretionary policy by providing guidance on when and how aggressively to move interest rates in response to movements in output and inflationThe focus on rules is much more important under an interest rate operating procedure than under an operating procedure focused directly on monetary aggregate targets and is also more important under an interest rate operating procedure when the monetary aggregates as has been the case for some time do not bear a stable relationship to overall economic performance and therefore do not provide useful information about when and how aggressively to change interest rates Taylor type rules in this environment provide a disciplined approach to varying interest rates in response to economic developments that both ensures a pro cyclical response of interest rates to demand shocks and imposes a nominal anchor in much the same way as would be the case under a monetary aggregate strategy with a stable money demand For this reason I like to refer to the strategy implicit in such rules as monetarism without moneyThis should not suggest that we can write a rule that is appropriate in all circumstances to all varieties of shocks and to all the varieties of cyclical experience Rules at best can discipline judgment rather than replace judgment A particular problem with Taylor type rules is that we do not know the equilibrium real federal funds rate and whatever it might be at one point in time it likely varies over time There is considerable research under way at the Board in an effort to find specifications and parameters for rules which achieve an efficient balancing of inflation and output variability and provide guidance about patterns and aggressiveness of interest rate adjustments consistent with the stabilizing properties of high performing rulesReturn to topII The FRB US Model Rational Expectations in a Sticky Price ModelThe newly redesigned model at the Board the FRB US model replaces the MPS model The MPS model developed in the mid to late s revolutionized macroeconometric modeling and set the standard for a considerable period of time The Board participated in the development of the MPS model and then became its home and the Board staff kept the faith alive during the lean years when such models lost respectability in academic circles even as their usefulness and value in forecasting and practical policy analysis was growing in the real world The FRB US model retains much of the underlying structure in terms of equilibrium relationships and even more of the fundamental simulation properties of the MPS model but significantly modernizes the estimation of the model and the treatment of expectationsThe vision in the new work is to separate macro dynamics into adjustment cost and expectations formation components with adjustment costs imposing a degree of inertia and expectations introducing a forward looking element into the dynamics The net result is a structure that integrates rational expectations into a sticky price model In this respect the new model follows closely the approach pioneered by John Taylor Finally the estimation technique makes use of co integration and an error correction frameworkFinancial and exchange rate relationships are based on arbitrage equations with no adjustment costs but with explicitly forward looking expectations The specification of nonfinancial equations in contrast incorporates both adjustment costs and rational expectationsRational expectations are implemented in two alternative ways First expectations can be specified as model consistent expectations that is the expectations about future inflation can be set to equal future inflation perfect foresight through iterative solutions of the model Model consistent expectations may but need not assume that the private sector has complete knowledge of the policy rule being followed by the Federal Reserve In the second approach expectations are also viewed as being model consistent but in this case the model relevant to expectations is not precisely the same as the FRBUS model Instead expectations are formed based on a simpler VAR model of the economy The VAR model always includes three variables the output gap a short term interest rate and inflation When expectations of additional sector specific variables are required the system is expanded to include the additional variable A unique aspect of the VAR expectations is that these equations also incorporate explicit forward looking information through an error correction specification For example the VAR equations include a term for the gap between actual inflation and the publics long run expectations of inflation based on survey measures of long run inflation expectations which in turn might be viewed as based on a combination of the publics perception of the Federal Reserves reaction including its tolerance of inflation over the long run The equations also include the gap between actual short term interest rates and the publics long run expectations of short term rates gleaned from the yield curveThe model retains the neo Classical synthesis vision of the MPS model short run output dynamics based on sticky prices and long run Classical properties associated with price flexibility and therefore produces multiplier results both in the short and longer runs that are very similar to those produced by the MPS model The result is that the model produces for the most part what may be the best of two worlds a modern form and traditional results But the better articulated role of expectations in the new model also allows a richer analysis of the response to those policy actions which might have immediate impacts on inflation andor interest rate expectationsThe model has several advantages The first is it may be more credible to a wider audience because of its modernization in terms of cointegration and error learning specification on the one hand and explicit use of rational expectations on the other hand Second the model is much more flexible in terms of research potential It allows one to study in particular how the response to monetary or fiscal policies depends on features of the expectation formation process Third the model forces the user to make assumptions explicitly about expectations formation that otherwise could be avoided or hiddenLet me give two examples of policy options that can be analyzed more effectively in the new model First consider a deficit reduction package that is credible and promises to lower interest rates in the future In models like MPS and WUMM the mechanical fiscal policy simulation would ignore any bond market effect associated with changed expectations about future short term rates One could of course add factor downward the long term bond rate in the term structure equation to impose a bond market effect but the structure of the model neither immediately points you in this direction nor provides any guidance about how to intervene In FRB US in contrast one cannot avoid making an explicit assumption about the credibility of such a policy through assumptions about future short term interest rates in the VAR expectations or in the context of model consistent expectations and the assumption made about credibility will importantly affect the short run dynamics though not the long run effects of the policySecond consider the transitional costs of reducing inflation The transitional effects on output depend importantly on the assumptions made about the credibility of the inflation commitment Note however that there are significant transitional output costs of disinflation even under full credibility and the model consistent specification of rational expectations arising from the sticky price implication of the adjustment cost specification For my part I prefer the FRB US simulations based on limited rather than perfect credibility because I do not believe that credibility effects significantly diminish the transition costs of lowering inflation But I also value having a disciplined approach to showing how the costs of disinflation would vary with the differing degrees of credibility'"
