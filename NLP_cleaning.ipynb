This research seminar is part of the Federal Reserve\\'s series of events called \"Toward an Inclusive Recovery.\"Today\\'s seminar, hosted by the Board of Governors, will focus on how the COVID-19 pandemic affected educational outcomes and the subsequent impact we anticipate for transitions to the labor force. We have invited accomplished researchers to discuss their workâ\\x80\\x94and what practical lessons might be drawn from itâ\\x80\\x94that could help inform community development practice and public policy considerations.As I am sure you are aware, the pandemic created significant disruptions for our students and the education system. At the onset of the pandemic, steps taken to slow the spread of COVID-19 resulted in widespread closures of businesses and schools. Many, myself included, were immediately concerned about the negative effects on education from changes that included shifting to virtual instruction, lack of access to technology, and changes to the accessibility and provision of childcare. It is critical to consider that access to education at every step along a student\\'s learning path serves as a pipeline into the labor force and enables future generations of Americans to participate and thrive in our dynamic labor market. The disruption of education throughout the pandemic undoubtedly led to an absence of workers in the labor force, creating a shortage that held back the early economic recovery.Education outcomes, including learning losses and achievements, take time to measure, aggregate, and analyze. As we enter the fourth academic year affected by the pandemic, data on student performance are becoming more available. Much of this early data confirms our initial concerns. For example, early test scores show that throughout the country nine-year-olds suffered a decline in learning outcomes during the pandemic. But other data also indicate that learning losses were unequal and disproportionately affected low-performing students and low-income students.It is likely that the sudden shift to online classes contributed to the learning declines. According to the Board\\'s 2020 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (the SHED), only 22 percent of parents with children attending virtual classes agreed that their children learned as much as they would have attending classes in person at school. I hope that the return to in-person learning and reopening of schools will enable children to resume normal learning and that academic achievement will rebound.It seems that even with this return to in-person attendance, many schools are struggling to provide students with the same quality of education as they did pre-pandemic. With the return to onsite education, many schools are confronting challenges that impair their ability to meet the educational needs of students. A number of educators appear to have left the profession, as indicated by the nearly 100,000 more job openings for teachers in July 2022 than before the pandemic.1Complicating these issues, across the country the return to in-person instruction has been met by an increase in chronic absenteeism, which is defined as a student missing at least 10 percent of school days in a school year. Compared to a typical school year pre-pandemic, 72 percent of U.S. public schools reported an increase in chronic absenteeism among their students during the 2021â\\x80\\x9322 school year, which is a 39 percent increase over the previous year.2Missed school typically means missed learning, so chronic absenteeism is a key metric of school performance. It\\'s likely that these challenges will result in lower graduation rates and possibly less stable employment than would have otherwise been the case.These outcomes raise difficult questions about how to best respond to the needs of students and educators going forward. For example, how can curricula be adjusted to meet students where they are today, after nearly three years of pandemic-impacted learning? How can we best re-engage the larger proportion of students who may have become disconnected as a result of these pandemic-related disruptions to their education? What does this all mean for the future of the labor force?In addition to the challenges facing primary and secondary education, higher education was not immune to pandemic disruptions. Like K-12 education, studies show that online instruction reduced the academic performance of college students.3 In addition, we have seen declines in both college enrollment and the rate of first-year college students who continue their education into a second year.4 These declines are most pronounced at community colleges and open-access programs. Some of this decline was due to a supply-induced shortage resulting from colleges unable to offer remote learning options for many technical and vocational programs. The reduction in these \"hands-on\" programs, such as air-conditioning repair and auto detailing, had a greater impact on male enrollment and may lead to labor supply shortages for some of these skills-based professions.5Education is the greatest and most effective input into the future of our labor market. In order to have the strongest possible labor force in the future, it is critical to understand and act immediately to address the educational losses experienced during the pandemic. I\\'m sure there\\'s much to learn about how these education challenges, both longstanding and more recent, will ultimately affect the job market. That\\'s a question of particular interest to policymakers, and it\\'s one of the most important reasons that we host events like this seminar. I look forward to hearing from the experts we have invited here today to discuss ideas to successfully and quickly address academic declines, expand K-12 education options, improve higher education outcomes, and prepare this generation to participate and thrive in the future labor force.Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551'"

      "text/plain": "'Remarks by Governor Edward W. Kelley, Jr. Developments in electronic money and banking At the CyberPayments \\'96 Conference, Dallas, Texas June 18, 1996It is a pleasure to be here this afternoon to provide      the Federal Reserve\\'s perspective on recent developments in the      field of electronic money and banking.  To begin, let me remind      you that progress in the retail electronic banking sector so far      has been slow in the United States.  Twenty years ago, a national      Commission was appointed by the Congress to study many of the      issues surrounding emerging electronic funds transfer systems,      particularly as they were seen to affect consumers and the      general public.  The assumption at that time was that the use of      currency and checks in the United States would rapidly disappear.      Indeed, the creation of the Automated Clearing House system and      NACHA have their roots in this era of our history.  Yet today,      paper currency and checks are still used for the overwhelming      majority of consumer payments, while electronic transfers, such      as those made over the ACH, account for a very small fraction.      In contrast, for the major money and securities markets in this      country, electronic payments are the rule rather than the      exception.  Settlements for these markets generate many of the      electronic funds transfers over the Federal Reserve\\'s Fedwire      system and the New York Clearinghouse CHIPS system, which total      more than $2 trillion per day and represent most of the daily      dollar value of payments in this country.With this background in mind, the Federal Reserve has      adopted a view toward the development of new electronic money and      banking products that emphasizes the need for innovation,      particularly in the retail sector, supported by a realistic      approach to regulation.  It is the private sector that must play      the pivotal role in identifying which services consumers and      businesses want, and are willing to pay for, in areas such as      stored-value -- or \"smart\" -- cards and payments over the      Internet, and in the development of new home-banking products.      If the past is any guide, consumer acceptance and use of new      payment and banking technologies will grow slowly, and we can be      certain that many of the new products will not succeed      commercially.  But those products that do prove to reduce costs      and improve the choices available to consumers and businesses in      conducting their economic activities could gain widespread      acceptance in the longer term.Competition in these efforts is healthy, particularly      in areas where new technologies must be turned into practical      products that, in many cases, will compete with older,      established payment methods and delivery channels.  Although I      would expect that banks will continue to serve as the core of the      payment system, non-banking organizations, which traditionally      have been active in this field, appear to be contributing to the      competitive environment and serving as an impetus to innovation.      Heavy-handed, preemptive attempts at regulating these products      and the competitive process before significant social risks have      been demonstrated would likely handicap innovation for no      compelling reason.  On the other hand, history also suggests      that, if significant problems affecting the economic interests      and well-being of a wide group of our citizens were to arise in      the future, there would be a corresponding legislative and      regulatory response.  While we do not see the need for new      substantive regulations at this time, there is an on-going need      to review existing regulations and supervisory practices in order      to adapt to technological as well as financial innovations, as I      will mention later.Let me now turn to the Federal Reserve\\'s views of the      potential impact of retail electronic banking and payments on the      three primary central banking functions:  monetary policy,      banking supervision, and the payment system.  In these as well as      related areas, such as consumer privacy and industry competition,      the policy issues being raised in the current debate about      electronic payments are the same as those analyzed in the 1970s      by the national EFT Commission.  In fact, in many cases the      striking parallels give the distinct impression that \"we\\'ve been      here before.\"As for the conduct of monetary policy, in hindsight, it      may seem surprising that there were concerns at that time about      the impact of the ACH.  Then as now, the potential impact on      monetary policy of new electronic payment products has been      greatly exaggerated.  As with the use of the ACH, we would not      expect that the expansion of electronic delivery of existing      banking services will have appreciable effects on the money      supply or the money markets.  In contrast, \"electronic cash\" or      other new electronic payment products, if successful, could      gradually lead to shifts among different forms of money held by      consumers and thus potentially affect the behavior of the      monetary aggregates.  Yet concerns about loss of \"control\" of the      money supply are misdirected.  In the last twenty years, major      shifts caused by other financial innovations have led to some      changes over time in the ways in which monetary policy is      formulated, with the monetary aggregates now playing a lesser      role.  Moreover, financial innovation has not seriously      undermined central banks\\' ability to implement policy, although      adaptations have sometimes been called for.Although growth rates of the money supply are no longer      the central focus of monetary policy making, the Federal Reserve      still needs to monitor the monetary aggregates carefully in the      policy process, and it will remain important that the aggregates      accurately measure the various instruments that are being used as      money.  Accordingly, we do expect to include any significant      amounts of new general-purpose payment instruments, such as      balances on stored-value cards, in the monetary aggregates, and      the Federal Reserve has the statutory authority to require any      necessary reports from depository institutions.  If new payment      instruments were issued by nonbanks, we would expect to obtain      voluntary reports from issuers, as we traditionally have done      with travelers checks.Before I move on to the topic of banking supervision,      I would like to touch on the question of \"seigniorage,\" a term      often used for income that governments generate through issuance      of non-interest bearing coin and currency.  First, the amount of      currency displaced by new payment products relative to the amount      outstanding, and the corresponding impact on federal revenues in      the near term, is likely to be very small in percentage terms.      For example, in a scenario in which every resident of the United      States held $150 on a stored-value card or electronic cash      account, which I view as highly optimistic over a near-to-medium-      term horizon, the total value outstanding would amount to less      than $50 billion, or only about 10 percent of the currency stock.      Moreover, estimates are that as much as two-thirds of the value      of U.S. currency circulates abroad, a market where holders may be      even more resistant to giving up Federal Reserve notes for      privately issued electronic products.  Second, even if there is      some erosion of federal revenues due to declining demand for      currency, this should not be a governing factor in public policy      toward innovative payment products.  Indeed, existing products      such as credit and debit cards, along with checking accounts,      have probably reduced the use of currency over time relative to      what it would otherwise have been, which is a natural outcome of      innovation and improvement in banking and payment systems.Second, banking supervision.  While any substantial      implications for monetary and fiscal policy are well into the      future, new electronic banking services could require changes in      the way that banking supervision is conducted in the relatively      near term.  The Federal Reserve is responsible for examining and      assessing the safety and soundness of bank holding companies,      state-chartered Federal Reserve member banks, and U.S. branches      and agencies of foreign banks.  These examinations include a      review of institutions\\' information systems, including security      controls and contingency arrangements.  Internet-based home      banking services, as well as new payment products such as stored-      value cards, have the potential to expose institutions to      significant liability if security measures were breached for      fraudulent or malicious purposes.  Of course, institutions have      strong incentives to protect themselves against these risks, and      early indications are that the more sophisticated are investing      considerable resources in doing so.The Federal Reserve is actively monitoring developments      in this area so as to be in a strong position to address any      supervisory concerns that may arise.  We are reviewing the way      that we examine banks\\' information systems to address      developments in electronic banking, among other things.  However,      banking regulators cannot possibly assess the adequacy of every      Internet firewall or smart card.  Rather, the role of regulators      is to require policies and procedures to be in place within      banking organizations to ensure that risks are identified and      managed.  For example, the Board recently approved the first      application of a bank holding company for a subsidiary to engage      in data processing activities that support the provision of      banking and financial services over the Internet.  In this      approval order, involving the widely publicized Security First      Network Bank, which is offering retail banking services primarily      over the Internet, the Board noted that it expects banking      organizations considering providing such services to analyze      carefully the associated risks and to evaluate whether those      risks are consistent with their policies relating to the security      of customer information and other data.  Of course, banks may      first need to assure themselves that their existing information      security policies and procedures are adequate for an expanding      range of electronic banking activities.  I would hope and expect      such safety evaluations to be demanded by customers, as well as      regulators.The third main area of central bank responsibility is      the payment system.  It may be helpful to begin by considering      the nature of payment systems and how they might be affected by      new electronic payment products.  First, all payment systems      consist of money and the means of transferring money from one      individual or organization to another.  New electronic payment      methods that can be envisioned do not change this fact, although      they may result in different forms of money and new technology      for executing transfers.  Second, the payment system comprises      several main sectors, ranging from large financial institutions      that play a major role both as users and providers of many      different payment services, to consumers and small businesses      that primarily use smaller value payment systems.  Of course, the      Federal Reserve also plays a unifying role in the payment system      as the provider of currency, interbank clearing and settlement      services, and, in some cases, regulator.New electronic payment products, such as stored-value      cards and Internet payment services, are designed primarily to      automate the billions of relatively small-value transactions      involving consumers and non-financial businesses.  The      transactions involved are as diverse as the commercial economy of      the United States, and the future needs for payment systems, both      in traditional face-to-face business and in commerce over open      networks such as the Internet, are evolving daily.While the Federal Reserve\\'s interbank payment services,      such as Fedwire and ACH, have been highly automated for years, we      are examining areas where we can make use of new technology where      appropriate.  For example, we are continuing to keep abreast of      new developments in areas such as encryption, electronic      communications, and data security to ensure that our existing      payment systems take full advantage of any improvements.  As a      side point, I might mention that we are also making use of the      Internet to provide public information services; the Reserve      Banks and the Board of Governors now maintain home pages on the      Internet\\'s World Wide Web, where we provide up-to-date      information that may be useful to the general public, such as      monetary and economic statistics and Federal Reserve      publications.As I have mentioned on previous occasions, however, I      do not anticipate that the Federal Reserve will seek to provide a      new retail electronic payment product in this emerging industry.      In the 1970s, the Federal Reserve took a central role in      developing the ACH system on behalf of the banking industry, and      then explicitly subsidized operation of the ACH for some time.      Now, twenty years later, circumstances are sufficiently different      that we do not believe that a similar approach would be necessary      or desirable to advance the efficiency and effectiveness of the      payment system.  There is no lack of private sector investment in      providing new products and new means of delivering services to      consumers.  Experimentation is needed to determine which products      best fit consumers\\' needs, but history has shown that the private      sector, rather than government, is best able to perform this      role.The Federal Reserve is, however, examining ways in      which we can support industry initiatives where appropriate.  For      example, we are currently reviewing our existing interbank net      settlement services for check clearinghouses and private ACH      operators and considering whether similar services could be      provided for other monetary instruments that the banking industry      may offer to their customers.The Federal Reserve also has specific regulatory      responsibilities as well as a general interest in the continuing      integrity of the payment system.  Some have raised concerns that      new electronic payment products, such as those that could be used      over the Internet or are offered by unregulated entities, could      create new avenues for criminal financial activities or threaten      the integrity of the payment system.  Although the Federal      Reserve, as well as other authorities, will be vigilant in      monitoring developments, we believe that these concerns are      premature.  Until new payment products gain widespread      acceptance, their usefulness in criminal activities will      necessarily be limited.  Moreover, the measures that prudent      institutions will impose to limit the security risks in offering      new products, such as relatively low monetary limits and      transaction record keeping where practical, will also limit their      impact on the payment system more broadly.  Of course, if these      instruments were to spread more quickly than expected and were      provided by organizations that did not have due regard for the      safety of funds entrusted to them, concerns would be greater, as      would the likelihood of regulatory actions.  But we do not see      this prospect on the horizon at this stage.We have focused attention recently on modernizing      existing regulations in the context of our regulatory planning      and review process as well as clarifying how they apply to new      technologies; these efforts should serve to reduce any latent      regulatory barriers or uncertainty that might hinder development      of electronic payment products and services.  For example, the      Board recently adopted changes to Regulation E that would permit      consumers to provide appropriate electronic authorization for      electronic funds transfers, in place of a written signature.  We      have also proposed additional changes to Regulation E under which      required information, such as certain notices and disclosures,      could be transmitted electronically, for example, in home banking      systems.As you probably know, the Federal Reserve Board also      recently issued a request for public comment on the treatment of      stored-value cards under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and      Regulation E.  The proposal would exempt many stored-value cards      from Regulation E provisions, such as liability limits for      unauthorized transfers, error resolution procedures, and printed      receipts and account statements.  Cards with maximum balances of      less than $100 would be wholly exempt, while issuers of most      larger-value cards would need to disclose the terms and      conditions of the cards to customers, a practice that would be      prudent for any new product.  I hope industry participants as      well as potential users will provide comments to help us refine      the proposal over the coming months and ensure that it provides      the appropriate level of consumer protection without unnecessary      and costly regulatory burdens or undesirable incentives.History has shown that technological innovations can      provide widespread benefits across society.  The Federal Reserve      welcomes private-sector investment and innovation to improve      efficiency and effectiveness in all areas of banking and payments      activities, while at the same time preserving the safety and      soundness of the financial system.  We are always open to      discussions and suggestions from the industry in this respect and      on any other issues involving emerging money and banking      products.  This is the strategy I expect we will pursue as      experience with new electronic money and banking products unfolds      over the next few years.Return to top1996 Speeches     Home | News and events  Accessibility | Contact Us  Last update: July 23, 1996 12:00 PM   (function(){var js = \"window[\\'__CF$cv$params\\']={r:\\'7648c52feb497136\\',m:\\'D06JJUGqatsQa11vNVHUkYzwIwmZiZct94KJC7lx9FQ-1667516889-0-AUDs4iiodUtGF05lcguwzoKCKSM2ydcflx+rU09wUDL2ebl3FICsgx/4fzkSOnm4fgInzbKEMyktFvU2Q0mOH4XKGkHHLUqgUH29SHkO7f0bdnNcfUJZdHDr91iQ/5gEZ4plUhWTwh3Z/E9Drwmj3NjmIZQIdfwxlHolnZp96CQR\\',s:[0x4fad077ef0,0x46d058c706],u:\\'/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/h/g\\'};var now=Date.now()/1000,offset=14400,ts=\\'\\'+(Math.floor(now)-Math.floor(now%offset)),_cpo=document.createElement(\\'script\\');_cpo.nonce=\\'\\',_cpo.src=\\'/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/h/g/scripts/alpha/invisible.js?ts=\\'+ts,document.getElementsByTagName(\\'head\\')[0].appendChild(_cpo);\";var _0xh = document.createElement(\\'iframe\\');_0xh.height = 1;_0xh.width = 1;_0xh.style.position = \\'absolute\\';_0xh.style.top = 0;_0xh.style.left = 0;_0xh.style.border = \\'none\\';_0xh.style.visibility = \\'hidden\\';document.body.appendChild(_0xh);function handler() {var _0xi = _0xh.contentDocument || _0xh.contentWindow.document;if (_0xi) {var _0xj = _0xi.createElement(\\'script\\');_0xj.nonce = \\'\\';_0xj.innerHTML = js;_0xi.getElementsByTagName(\\'head\\')[0].appendChild(_0xj);}}if (document.readyState !== \\'loading\\') {handler();} else if (window.addEventListener) {document.addEventListener(\\'DOMContentLoaded\\', handler);} else {var prev = document.onreadystatechange || function () {};document.onreadystatechange = function (e) {prev(e);if (document.readyState !== \\'loading\\') {document.onreadystatechange = prev;handler();}};}})();'"

      "text/plain": "'Remarks by Governor Edward W. Kelley, Jr. Developments in electronic money and banking At the CyberPayments \\'96 Conference, Dallas, Texas June 18, 1996It is a pleasure to be here this afternoon to provide      the Federal Reserve\\'s perspective on recent developments in the      field of electronic money and banking.  To begin, let me remind      you that progress in the retail electronic banking sector so far      has been slow in the United States.  Twenty years ago, a national      Commission was appointed by the Congress to study many of the      issues surrounding emerging electronic funds transfer systems,      particularly as they were seen to affect consumers and the      general public.  The assumption at that time was that the use of      currency and checks in the United States would rapidly disappear.      Indeed, the creation of the Automated Clearing House system and      NACHA have their roots in this era of our history.  Yet today,      paper currency and checks are still used for the overwhelming      majority of consumer payments, while electronic transfers, such      as those made over the ACH, account for a very small fraction.      In contrast, for the major money and securities markets in this      country, electronic payments are the rule rather than the      exception.  Settlements for these markets generate many of the      electronic funds transfers over the Federal Reserve\\'s Fedwire      system and the New York Clearinghouse CHIPS system, which total      more than $2 trillion per day and represent most of the daily      dollar value of payments in this country.With this background in mind, the Federal Reserve has      adopted a view toward the development of new electronic money and      banking products that emphasizes the need for innovation,      particularly in the retail sector, supported by a realistic      approach to regulation.  It is the private sector that must play      the pivotal role in identifying which services consumers and      businesses want, and are willing to pay for, in areas such as      stored-value -- or \"smart\" -- cards and payments over the      Internet, and in the development of new home-banking products.      If the past is any guide, consumer acceptance and use of new      payment and banking technologies will grow slowly, and we can be      certain that many of the new products will not succeed      commercially.  But those products that do prove to reduce costs      and improve the choices available to consumers and businesses in      conducting their economic activities could gain widespread      acceptance in the longer term.Competition in these efforts is healthy, particularly      in areas where new technologies must be turned into practical      products that, in many cases, will compete with older,      established payment methods and delivery channels.  Although I      would expect that banks will continue to serve as the core of the      payment system, non-banking organizations, which traditionally      have been active in this field, appear to be contributing to the      competitive environment and serving as an impetus to innovation.      Heavy-handed, preemptive attempts at regulating these products      and the competitive process before significant social risks have      been demonstrated would likely handicap innovation for no      compelling reason.  On the other hand, history also suggests      that, if significant problems affecting the economic interests      and well-being of a wide group of our citizens were to arise in      the future, there would be a corresponding legislative and      regulatory response.  While we do not see the need for new      substantive regulations at this time, there is an on-going need      to review existing regulations and supervisory practices in order      to adapt to technological as well as financial innovations, as I      will mention later.Let me now turn to the Federal Reserve\\'s views of the      potential impact of retail electronic banking and payments on the      three primary central banking functions:  monetary policy,      banking supervision, and the payment system.  In these as well as      related areas, such as consumer privacy and industry competition,      the policy issues being raised in the current debate about      electronic payments are the same as those analyzed in the 1970s      by the national EFT Commission.  In fact, in many cases the      striking parallels give the distinct impression that \"we\\'ve been      here before.\"As for the conduct of monetary policy, in hindsight, it      may seem surprising that there were concerns at that time about      the impact of the ACH.  Then as now, the potential impact on      monetary policy of new electronic payment products has been      greatly exaggerated.  As with the use of the ACH, we would not      expect that the expansion of electronic delivery of existing      banking services will have appreciable effects on the money      supply or the money markets.  In contrast, \"electronic cash\" or      other new electronic payment products, if successful, could      gradually lead to shifts among different forms of money held by      consumers and thus potentially affect the behavior of the      monetary aggregates.  Yet concerns about loss of \"control\" of the      money supply are misdirected.  In the last twenty years, major      shifts caused by other financial innovations have led to some      changes over time in the ways in which monetary policy is      formulated, with the monetary aggregates now playing a lesser      role.  Moreover, financial innovation has not seriously      undermined central banks\\' ability to implement policy, although      adaptations have sometimes been called for.Although growth rates of the money supply are no longer      the central focus of monetary policy making, the Federal Reserve      still needs to monitor the monetary aggregates carefully in the      policy process, and it will remain important that the aggregates      accurately measure the various instruments that are being used as      money.  Accordingly, we do expect to include any significant      amounts of new general-purpose payment instruments, such as      balances on stored-value cards, in the monetary aggregates, and      the Federal Reserve has the statutory authority to require any      necessary reports from depository institutions.  If new payment      instruments were issued by nonbanks, we would expect to obtain      voluntary reports from issuers, as we traditionally have done      with travelers checks.Before I move on to the topic of banking supervision,      I would like to touch on the question of \"seigniorage,\" a term      often used for income that governments generate through issuance      of non-interest bearing coin and currency.  First, the amount of      currency displaced by new payment products relative to the amount      outstanding, and the corresponding impact on federal revenues in      the near term, is likely to be very small in percentage terms.      For example, in a scenario in which every resident of the United      States held $150 on a stored-value card or electronic cash      account, which I view as highly optimistic over a near-to-medium-      term horizon, the total value outstanding would amount to less      than $50 billion, or only about 10 percent of the currency stock.      Moreover, estimates are that as much as two-thirds of the value      of U.S. currency circulates abroad, a market where holders may be      even more resistant to giving up Federal Reserve notes for      privately issued electronic products.  Second, even if there is      some erosion of federal revenues due to declining demand for      currency, this should not be a governing factor in public policy      toward innovative payment products.  Indeed, existing products      such as credit and debit cards, along with checking accounts,      have probably reduced the use of currency over time relative to      what it would otherwise have been, which is a natural outcome of      innovation and improvement in banking and payment systems.Second, banking supervision.  While any substantial      implications for monetary and fiscal policy are well into the      future, new electronic banking services could require changes in      the way that banking supervision is conducted in the relatively      near term.  The Federal Reserve is responsible for examining and      assessing the safety and soundness of bank holding companies,      state-chartered Federal Reserve member banks, and U.S. branches      and agencies of foreign banks.  These examinations include a      review of institutions\\' information systems, including security      controls and contingency arrangements.  Internet-based home      banking services, as well as new payment products such as stored-      value cards, have the potential to expose institutions to      significant liability if security measures were breached for      fraudulent or malicious purposes.  Of course, institutions have      strong incentives to protect themselves against these risks, and      early indications are that the more sophisticated are investing      considerable resources in doing so.The Federal Reserve is actively monitoring developments      in this area so as to be in a strong position to address any      supervisory concerns that may arise.

Of course, banks may      first need to assure themselves that their existing information      security policies and procedures are adequate for an expanding      range of electronic banking activities.  I would hope and expect      such safety evaluations to be demanded by customers, as well as      regulators.The third main area of central bank responsibility is      the payment system.  It may be helpful to begin by considering      the nature of payment systems and how they might be affected by      new electronic payment products.

The proposal would exempt many stored-value cards      from Regulation E provisions, such as liability limits for      unauthorized transfers, error resolution procedures, and printed      receipts and account statements.  Cards with maximum balances of      less than $100 would be wholly exempt, while issuers of most      larger-value cards would need to disclose the terms and      conditions of the cards to customers, a practice that would be      prudent for any new product.  I hope industry participants as      well as potential users will provide comments to help us refine      the proposal over the coming months and ensure that it provides      the appropriate level of consumer protection without unnecessary      and costly regulatory burdens or undesirable incentives.History has shown that technological innovations can      provide widespread benefits across society.  The Federal Reserve      welcomes private-sector investment and innovation to improve      efficiency and effectiveness in all areas of banking and payments      activities, while at the same time preserving the safety and      soundness of the financial system.  We are always open to      discussions and suggestions from the industry in this respect and      on any other issues involving emerging money and banking      products.  This is the strategy I expect we will pursue as      experience with new electronic money and banking products unfolds      over the next few years.Return to top1996 Speeches     Home | News and events  Accessibility | Contact Us  Last update: July 23, 1996 12:00 PM   (function(){var js = \"window[\\'__CF$cv$params\\']={r:\\'7648c52feb497136\\',m:\\'D06JJUGqatsQa11vNVHUkYzwIwmZiZct94KJC7lx9FQ-1667516889-0-AUDs4iiodUtGF05lcguwzoKCKSM2ydcflx+rU09wUDL2ebl3FICsgx/4fzkSOnm4fgInzbKEMyktFvU2Q0mOH4XKGkHHLUqgUH29SHkO7f0bdnNcfUJZdHDr91iQ/5gEZ4plUhWTwh3Z/E9Drwmj3NjmIZQIdfwxlHolnZp96CQR\\',s:[0x4fad077ef0,0x46d058c706],u:\\'/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/h/g\\'};var now=Date.now()/1000,offset=14400,ts=\\'\\'+(Math.floor(now)-Math.floor(now%offset)),_cpo=document.createElement(\\'script\\');_cpo.nonce=\\'\\',_cpo.src=\\'/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/h/g/scripts/alpha/invisible.js?ts=\\'+ts,document.getElementsByTagName(\\'head\\')[0].appendChild(_cpo);\";var _0xh = document.createElement(\\'iframe\\');_0xh.height = 1;_0xh.width = 1;_0xh.style.position = \\'absolute\\';_0xh.style.top = 0;_0xh.style.left = 0;_0xh.style.border = \\'none\\';_0xh.style.visibility = \\'hidden\\';document.body.appendChild(_0xh);function handler() {var _0xi = _0xh.contentDocument || _0xh.contentWindow.document;if (_0xi) {var _0xj = _0xi.createElement(\\'script\\');_0xj.nonce = \\'\\';_0xj.innerHTML = js;_0xi.getElementsByTagName(\\'head\\')[0].appendChild(_0xj);}}if (document.readyState !== \\'loading\\') {handler();} else if (window.addEventListener) {document.addEventListener(\\'DOMContentLoaded\\', handler);} else {var prev = document.onreadystatechange || function () {};document.onreadystatechange = function (e) {prev(e);if (document.readyState !== \\'loading\\') {document.onreadystatechange = prev;handler();}};}})();'"

      "text/plain": "'the Transformation of the U.S. Banking Industry and Resulting Challenges to RegulatorsGood morning .   it be a pleasure to be here on Ohio Bankers Day . the over - ride theme of my remark be the profound transformation the banking industry have undergo over the last 15 year or so and the challenge that these change pose to bank regulator .   at the end , I hope to have time to take some question and learn where you think the banking industry be go , and how -- consistent with our responsibility -- regulator can promote a more efficient , resilient , and profitable financial service industry .   I plan to learn as much or more from you as you learn from I . the Role of Banks let I begin with a few observation about the importance of the banking industry in the economy and why banking receive such special attention in term of regulation . bank , like other financial intermediary , pool and absorb risk for depositor and provide stable source of investment and work capital fund for nonfinancial industry . bank also provide a unique mix of service among all financial intermediary , include a \" safe haven \" for small , unsophisticated investor through insured deposit , an important source of fund for small borrower who often have limit access to other source of external finance , a smoothly function payment system that allow financial and real resource to flow relatively freely to their high - return use , a conduit for monetary policy , and a backup source of liquidity for any sector in temporary difficulty through its access to the discount window . throughout all the change of the past , and through all the change to the banking industry in the foreseeable future , bank will continue to perform these important function , and a goal of bank regulator be to make sure that there be a healthy banking industry to do so . return to topThe Rationale for Bank Regulation but there be two particularly important characteristic of the banking system that demand our attention as regulator -- indeed , be critical to understand why there be bank regulator .   first , bank have access to a government safety net through deposit insurance , the discount window , and payment system guarantee .   this give the government a direct stake in keep bank risk under control , just like a private insurance company have a stake in control the risk of policyholder .   because deposit insurance can never be fully and accurately price , it be necessary for we to monitor and sometimes to act to control bank risk in order to protect the potential call on taxpayer .   it be also important to understand that an unintended consequence of the safety net be that it create or augment incentive for some bank to take additional risk .   that be , the safety net create moral hazard incentive to gamble because the safety net -- and potentially taxpayer -- may absorb most of the loss if the gamble fail .   deposit insurance get in the way of the depositor signal a bank when it take excessive risk . the second characteristic of bank that require the special attention of regulator be that bank be capable of be the conduit of systemic risk and crisis in financial market .   a breakdown of the payment system or other contagion effect that hamper the ability of bank to intermediate credit flow could have serious adverse consequence for the economy , again require the special attention of regulator to bank risk . the challenge be to strike a balance in regulation so that , on the one hand , taxpayer be protect , extension of the safety net be avoid , and moral hazard incentive be mitigate without , on the other hand , undermine the competitiveness of the banking industry and its ability to take risk , and therefore damage the entity the regulator be try to protect . return to topThe Evolution of Bank Regulation although this rationale for bank regulation have not change , in the last decade and a half there have be a significant evolution in approach of regulator toward maintain the safety and soundness of the banking industry .   from the 1930 through most of the 1970 , regulator focus on keep the banking industry safe and sound by protect bank from competition and by limit the activity in which they could participate .   this mean , for example , prohibit interstate banking , restrict the rate that bank could pay on deposit , and prevent commercial bank from compete in other product market , such as investment banking .   during this period , the financial service industry be segment into separate entity provide commercial banking , investment banking , insurance service , etc .   this separation be largely due to legislative and regulatory decision .   a consequence of the separation be that firm in each segment of the financial service industry be protect from competition from firm provide the other service . start in the late 1970 , the change economic environment along with advance in technology , financial innovation , and globalization result in increase competition to U.S. bank by thrift , nondepository financial institution , foreign bank , and the capital market .   higher and more variable interest rate , and the accompany increase yield sensitivity of depositor and borrower , contribute to the development of money market mutual fund as alternative to bank deposit and the growth of finance company and commercial paper as substitute for bank loan . the increase in external competition bring a swift response from both bank and their regulator . bank respond to the challenge by expand in way that they could , also take advantage of improvement in technology and apply finance .   they expand their role as intermediary through off - balance - sheet activity such as securitization , back - up line of credit and derivative , and , in the process , substitute fee income for some of the interest income lose through competition with other financial intermediary . in addition , bank seek expand power to help they compete , include be able to cross state border , set their own deposit rate and account type , and -- by the late-1980 -- expand into security underwriting activity . regulator respond to the new environment by reduce the regulatory burden on bank and allow they to compete on a more level playing field with nonbanke firm .   that be , the new market reality require a reorientation in emphasis from protect bank from competition to give bank the opportunity to compete not only with other bank but with nonbank competitor as well .   by allow bank to enter other state , set their own price , and engage in other than traditional banking activity , the orientation of regulator evolve toward protect the safety net while allow bank to deliver financial service to the public efficiently , profitably , and with sufficient capital to be protect against unforeseen event . return to topStructural Change in the Banking Industry as a result of this process of structural change , the banking industry of the mid-1990 in many way hardly resemble that of the late 1970 and early 1980s .   some of the major change that I want to focus on be the increase consolidation of the industry , the decline in traditional banking service as a result of increase outside competition , the expansion in bank power , include the move into nontraditional activity to offset the competition for their traditional product , the increase emphasis on risk management in response to the increase complexity of financial instrument and practice , and the evolution of capital standard and capital position to keep abreast of the change risk profile of banking organization . consolidation in the banking industry one of the most obvious and dramatic change be the consolidation of the banking industry . the number of independent banking organization -- by which I mean top - tier hold company plus unaffiliated bank -- have shrink by more than one - third since the late 1970 , from more than 12,000 to few than 8,000 .   the percentage of banking asset control by organization with more than $ 100 billion have about double , and be now close to a fifth of all U.S. banking asset , while the percentage of banking asset in banking organization with less than $ 100 million in asset have drop by half , from about 14 percent to 7 percent of industry asset . much of the consolidation be a direct outgrowth of the removal of geographic restriction on bank branching and hold company acquisition by the individual state , a process that be now be extend by the Reagle - Neal Interstate Banking and Branch Efficiency Act of 1994 .   this deregulation encourage the banking industry to become more efficient at serve the public ’s need by allow the efficient competitor to succeed and manage more of the industry ’s resource .   the banking industry have also become strong through the geographic diversification of risk make possible by interstate banking . importantly , the interstate expansion of large bank do not mean the end of small bank .   past experience have consistently show that when large banking organization enter a new local market by acquisition , the exist small bank that be efficient can compete successfully and maintain their market share and profitability .   we fully expect thousand of small bank to remain in business even after nationwide branching be fully implement . the emergence of , and response to , increase outside competition : a decline in traditional banking and the growth of nontraditional activity over the last 15 year , there have also be a substantial increase in competition to the U.S. banking industry from capital market , less - regulate domestic financial institution , and foreign institution .   as a result , U.S. bank have lose substantial market share of many of the asset and liability category that be the mainstay of traditional banking .   however , these decline in market share for bank in traditional product line do not suggest that the banking industry itself be in decline .   after factor into the analysis the rapid expansion of nontraditional off - balance - sheet activity , research suggest that the banking industry continue to grow , although not as fast as financial market as a whole .   the banking industry , for example , have grow at about the same rate as GDP and the new product of the banking industry -- such as derivative contract and other off - balance - sheet activity -- have skyrocket . the most important indicator of whether the banking industry be in decline -- measure of financial performance -- be even more positive .   the banking industry be profitable , able to raise capital in financial market , and have a relatively high market - to - book ratio .   these performance indicator also suggest that resource will continue to flow into the industry , rather than out of the industry .   the evidence take as a whole suggest that the banking industry be weather the increase in outside competition and be compete well against it . return to topthe expansion of bank power the power of banking organization also grow dramatically over this time period in two different way .   first , in the early 1980s , the Monetary Control Act give bank the right to set their own deposit interest rate and offer new type of account , such as household transaction account that pay market - base interest rate . another major way in which banking organization power expand over this period be the increase in the number of banking activity permit to nonbank affiliate of bank hold company .   regulator allow bank hold company to enter more and more product market over this time period .   bank hold company can now have separately capitalize subsidiary that offer investment advice , provide discount brokerage service , and underwrite both debt and equity security , albeit under restricted circumstance .   the market also play a large part in blur the old distinction between bank and nonbank , as other financial service company begin to offer more product with characteristic close to those of bank deposit and loan . again , the regulatory shift in orientation be in large part a reaction to the market -- bank be give more power to compete with nonbank in part because nonbank be figure out well way to compete against bank . it be also notable that over time bank have take much great advantage of the power they already have .   as I mention early , bank greatly increase their use of off - balance - sheet guarantee to follow some of their loan customer who choose to borrow their fund elsewhere , and bank be also active player in the new derivative product of the 1980 and 1990s . increase emphasis on risk management and the grow importance of market risk despite these many change , the core business of banking have remain the measurement , acceptance , and management of risk , although a number of important development over the last 15 to 20 year have improve the ability of bank to perform these function .   the most notable development be in the area of market risk .   derivative contract such as future and swap be essentially new line of business for bank in the last decade and a half , which allow bank to measure , accept , and manage market risk to a much great extent than in the past . in the 1970 , bank primarily measure , accept , and manage the credit risk of illiquid loan and deal little with market risk other than minimal asset - liability duration matching .   the rapid development in market risk tool have facilitate an expansion of the core business of banking to put an increase emphasis on market risk , but bank be nonetheless still primarily in the same core business of measure , accept , and manage risk . however , it be important to recognize that have access to improve risk management technology do not necessarily make bank safe .   despite the improvement in the ability of bank to understand and control risk , the risk of the institution themselves ultimately also depend importantly on the incentive of bank manager and owner to control risk , and on the economic environment in which they operate .   there be little benefit , and perhaps net cost , in have a bank manager know how to measure , accept , and manage risk accurately if this ability be use to take excessive risk that be largely bear by the federal safety net and potentially by taxpayer .   similarly , when the economic environment turn against bank investment , many bank will become risky and some will fail , even if they have manage their risk fairly well . return to top     the source of the large number of bank failure in the 1980 and the dramatic improvement in the health of the banking system in the 1990 these caveat be well illustrate by compare the circumstance of U.S. bank in the 1980 versus the 1990s .   during the 1980s , bank failure be increase , and by the end of the decade bank be fail at the rate of about 200 per year .   even great problem be experience by the saving and loan industry .   these problem have be largely attribute to two factor . first , when bank or saving and loan get into very low or negative capital position , the moral hazard problem I discuss early may become more severe .   there be a possibility of purposely take on additional risk to gamble their way out of trouble .   when there be little capital at risk , the owner get much of the benefit if the gamble pay off , and the safety net and taxpayer bear most of the loss if the gamble fail . second , the 1980s see a number of turbulent economic change .   these include fluctuation in interest rate and inflation rate , swing in the price of commercial real estate and junk bond that could not be easily forecast , and regional recession that cause significant number of problem loan .   these change cause damage at many financial institution , particularly those in geographically undiversified position without sufficient capital to protect themselves . give the poor condition of many bank as late as 1991 , it be amazing how healthy the banking industry be now , having write off most of its bad asset , raise large amount of capital , and return to profitability , likely have its fifth straight year of record profit in 1996 .   bank failure have now retreat to at or near single digit per year .   clearly , this turnaround be too rapid to be completely account for by technical and financial innovation in the measurement , acceptance , and management of risk , or by improvement in the diversification and capitalization of bank .   change in attitude toward risk taking bring about by the high capital standard and other factor , and change in the economic environment have also play important role in the improved health and wealth of the banking industry . the evolution of capital standard and capital position the final development I will discuss be the evolution of the financial capital position of U.S. bank , since capital be the cornerstone of defense against bank risk .   Capital serve two function in this regard .   first , it help improve the incentive of bank to keep their own risk under control , reduce moral hazard incentive to take those risk that be largely impose on other . second , capital be a buffer stock available to absorb risk and economic shock without create bankruptcy cost and systemic problem associate with the failure of financial institution . a goal of capital requirement -- along with bank supervision and quality risk management by the bank themselves -- be to make the safety net a moot issue for most bank .   that be , by have enough capital available to absorb potential loss and have both the bank and supervisor carefully monitoring and act to control portfolio risk , the moral hazard incentive of the safety net and the vulnerability of the deposit insurance fund can be keep to a minimum .   it be similarly true that the more we can do to keep risk to the safety net under control use capital and other tool , the more power we can safely grant to bank without place undue stress on the safety net or meaningfully expand safety net protection to other activity . at the end of the 1970 , capital regulation be relatively ad hoc and depend largely on the judgment and discretion of the individual bank ’s supervisor .   start in 1981 , regulation require bank to hold capital equal to a flat percentage of their balance sheet asset .   the next refinement be base on Basle Accord risk - base capital standard -- adopt in 1988 and implement start in 1990 - -require bank to hold different amount of capital depend on the perceive credit risk of different on- and off - balance - sheet asset .   in addition , to reduce discretion in the enforcement of the standard and the closure of capital - impair bank , Congress include \" prompt corrective action \" provision in the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 ( FDICIA ) . under prompt corrective action , or PCA , bank with capital ratio below certain threshold value be subject to increasingly severe mandatory and discretionary sanction .   finally , risk - base capital standard which originally only cover credit risk be now be extend to cover market risk . the process by which the new market risk standard be arrive at be indicative of the new orientation toward incentive - base regulation , allow well capitalize , efficient bank to compete and impose cost more selectively on undercapitalized , poorly manage bank .   the standard also permit bank that be more efficient at monitor and control their risk to hold less capital than inefficient bank .   these regulatory standard be much like what the market would do in the absence of the safety net .   the new standard , which apply to bank with substantial trading , allow bank to use their own internal model of risk that be employ in their everyday operation to determine the capital requirement on their trading book .   this approach also reflect a new effort to develop refinement in regulatory standard in cooperation with the industry , in part by well understand the \" good practice \" that be evolve in the industry and use these as a basis for regulatory standard across the industry . a cumulative effect of the many change in capital regulation in the 1980 and early 1990 , as well as other factor , be that bank have much high capital ratio today than they do 15 year ago , and even 5 year ago .   this be especially true at the large banking organization .   for the banking industry as a whole , the equity - to - asset ratio rise from less than 6 percent at the end of the 1970 to over 8 percent in the mid-1990 .   for the large banking organization , the capital ratio rise from less than 4 percent to over 7 percent . return to topthe Implications of the Transformation of Banking for Bank Regulation we should not be too sanguine about bank capital , however .   while the current capital standard be significant improvement over what they replace , they be still base on broad one - size - fit - all rule .   moreover , the market have begin to focus more on the capital - risk trade - off : no large bank or parent banking organization , for example , have AAA long - term debt , and only a handful be rate AA , despite the capital ratio I just quote .   bank at the cutting edge be risk rate their loan portfolio and internally allocate capital to they for management and profitability analysis .   such allocation be superior way of develop capital allocation for individual bank . perhaps we will be able in the future to harness bank ’ internal capital allocation for regulatory purpose .   indeed , the reason for choose the topic I have discuss thus far be that these structural change represent an on - go process and be go to continue to challenge we in the future .   in the final portion of my remark , I will try to identify some of the most important challenge that regulator will face as a result of these change . maintain local competition in the face of continue bank consolidation first , with regard to future banking industry consolidation , the Riegle - Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 essentially expand the exist regional compact to the nation as a whole , and overturn the McFadden Act prohibition on interstate branching .   Interstate branching to almost all the state be permit as of June 1 , 1997 .   the removal of these artificial barrier to trade be beneficial and will likely improve efficiency and diversification of risk in the banking industry . the exact future structure of the banking industry be unknown , but presumably will be drive not just by the removal of legal barrier to competition , but by shift in technology , efficiency , and risk diversification .   the firm with the great managerial efficiency be expect to take over those with the low efficiency and improve they .   Research in banking suggest that these difference in managerial efficiency be much large than any scale and scope economy . various model predict that several thousand banking organization be likely to disappear under nationwide banking , but that the remain bank will still number in the thousand , as small community bank that serve their constituent well be likely to remain in business . there appear to be two key challenge to regulator regard consolidation .   the first be to be sure that there be adequate competition from bank and nonbank in local banking market . research have suggest that high local market concentration lead to price that be unfavorable to bank customer -- low deposit rate for retail depositor and high loan rate for small business loan .   high concentration may also lead to reduce managerial efficiency , as the price cushion provide by market power allow a \" quiet life \" for manager in which relatively little effort be require to be profitable .   insure an adequate amount of local - market competition be essential to avoid these potential problem . the second challenge bring on by consolidation be to make sure that merger and acquisition do not create excessive risk .   in this regard , it be important that capital be sufficient to cover any problem during the transition period when the bank and system be learn to work together , on top of the normal risk of ongoing operation . the interaction of bank power and bank structure the future expansion of banking organization power also raise some challenge to regulator . indeed , financial reform will likely be a high priority of the next Congress , perhaps include repeal of Glass - Steagall .   one of the result of financial reform , along the line of the bill Congressman Leach introduce last session , would be the emergence of financial service hold company that could include both commercial and investment bank .   there be also a prospect that bank might be able to expand into insurance activity as well .   this would take to a perhaps logical conclusion the recent blurring of the line between financial service firm . whether or not the Glass - Steagall Act be repeal , we face the challenge of insure that the propose recent expansion of bank power through section 20 subsidiary do not inadvertently expand the safety net protection afford to bank to protect other , previously nonbank , activity . this would give an unfair subsidy to banking organization . while there be no perfect system for allow financial intermediary to gain the most from the synergy of joint production while avoid expansion of the safety net , there be several step that seem likely to keep this problem under control .   first , we need to be sure to require plenty of capital in the bank to keep the value of access to the safety net low .   second , we need to provide reasonable insulation of the bank from the risk of the nonbanke enterprise .   the Board believe that the good way to do this be by place new activity in hold company subsidiary , rather than in the bank itself or its subsidiary .   the further the separation from the bank , the well be the insulation .   a third safeguard to protect the bank and prevent the expansion of the safety net subsidy be the adoption of prudential limitation through firewall and rule that prohibit or limit certain bank and affiliate transaction .   while firewall may temporarily bend under stress , they nonetheless serve a useful purpose .   on the other hand , we must strike a balance and not make the firewall so rigid that they would eliminate the economic synergy between the bank and their affiliate .   in this spirit , the Board last month make an effort to modify firewall to allow bank to achieve efficiency gain with respect to security underwriting in section 20 affiliate without create excessive risk . the issue of what bank structure be appropriate and prudent in light of expand banking power be a particularly controversial one .   while the Board ’s view that the expand power should be carry out only in subsidiary of the bank hold company be incorporate into the Congressman Leach ’s unsuccessful financial modernization bill in the last Congress , this preference be not share by all party to this debate .   some stress the cost associate with the hold company structure and   question its benefit from a safety and soundness perspective and , as a result , favor either allow the new activity to be carry out in a subsidiary of the bank itself or at least allow bank an option with respect to structural form . return to topstaye up - to - date in the supervision of bank risk management as financial product and practice evolve   there will undoubtedly be further development in the way that bank perform their core function of risk measurement , acceptance , and management as market continue to evolve improve \" good practice \" in deal with market and credit risk .   this evolution will continue to challenge regulator to keep capital standard and other risk monitoring and control mechanism from fall too far behind .   one particular challenge be that the continue development of derivative product and other mean of manage risk can also allow bank employee to take excessive risk and hide they from supervisor and perhaps from the owner of the bank .   it be difficult for regulator to quantify these risk , and even more difficult to design risk - base deposit insurance and risk - base capital system that accurately incorporate these risk . in response , regulator will need to stick with capital as the cornerstone of defense against bank risk , both to reduce moral hazard incentive and to provide a buffer stock to absorb loss .   a challenge will be to continue to update the capital standard in line with current or not - too - out - of - date risk measurement technique .   expansion of the recently implement \" internal model \" type of approach may be helpful in this regard , use , as I note early , bank ’ own risk measurement to help set their capital requirement .   in addition , many of the technique use to quantify and control market risk may be transferable for use in quantifying and control credit risk in the future . the task of measure capital and risk can also be make easy if bank portfolio be make somewhat more transparent .   increase transparency would also facilitate market discipline -- a highly desirable goal in our rapidly change financial environment .   a problem here be that it be not always clear how to well encourage transparency .   for example , partial market value accounting may involve more cost than benefit .   however , it seem clear that this be an issue that will remain on our plate for the foreseeable future . in addition , the capital standard can and should be augment by bank supervisor in individual case .   the risk - base capital standard and prompt corrective action rule be , and will remain , only minimum capital guideline for normal circumstance .   supervisor need to require additional capital when bank be explicitly take additional risk that be not capture by the guideline , or when bank risk be excessively opaque and it be too difficult to determine if excessive risk might be undertake .   to accomplish this , it be important to continue to examine bank on a regular basis .   there be simply no market substitute for the type of information that can be gather under the auspex of a bank examination with access to the complete record of a bank . however , as financial transaction become more complex , supervisor can not be expect to monitor every detail .   increasingly , supervisor will focus on bank ’ risk management procedure . bank will have to convince supervisor that they have prudent risk management procedure and policy and that the bank follow they .   increasingly , supervisor will emphasize your process of risk management and control , and proof that you be use those technique , in order to determine whether your capital be adequate for your risk profile and procedure . reduce the burden of regulation and increase the uniformity in regulation across banking agency while recent banking legislation significantly reduce the regulatory burden on the banking industry , we all realize that keep the cost of supervision and regulation low be an important on - go task for all party .   it be particularly important for the federal banking agency to continue effort at improve cooperation with each other , include standardization of certain policy and procedure and datum collection .   in short , we must try to reap the potential benefit of multiple regulator in term of encourage innovation and provide check and balance on regulatory excess , without incur the potential cost of \" competition in laxity \" and excessive overlap and duplication of effort .   I be optimistic that this can be do , perhaps by augment the role of the FFEIC.Return to top1996 Speeches     home | News and event   accessibility | contact Us   to comment on this site , please fill out our feedback form . last update : November 21 , 1996 2:00 pm'"
